We have here the commencement of what many writers call an episode, or rather two episodes, which intervene between the sixth and seventh trumpets, just as <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. occurs between the sixth and seventh seals. But as in the latter place we saw only a greater elaboration in the introduction to the seventh seal, and not a detached relation, so here <a href="../../par/revelation/10.htm">Revelation 10</a>. and Revelation 11:1-14 form a gradual transition from the sixth to the seventh trumpet, and supplement what is set forth under those trumpets. The passage is so far a digression, as it is occupied chiefly in setting forth the fate of the Church rather than that of the ungodly; but it only does so to demonstrate the wickedness of the world, and the inevitable nature of the last great punishment. <a href="../../par/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9</a>. ends (almost in a tone of surprise) with the words, "Neither repented they," etc.; therefore the angel now declares that, as all the warnings vouchsafed have brought men as a whole no nearer to God, the last final punishment must now fall. But, as if the measure of God's mercy were not yet fully filled up, it is shown how he has given to the world two witnesses, by which men might be induced to repent. But this, too, only serves to add to the condemnation of the world, which wrests this gift to its own destruction. We thus have the connection. God has sent punishments as warnings. But he not only has done this, he has also given direct instruction by the witness of his Word; man has despised both; therefore the end must come. Although the main object of the trumpet visions is to set forth the woes inflicted upon the wicked, yet the seer, as it were, hesitates to indicate the last dread punishment until he has alluded to the opportunities which God has afforded mankind of escaping that end. <span class="cmt_word">Another mighty angel come down from heaven;</span> <span class="accented">coming down out of heaven</span> (Revised Version). So in the vision of the seals, at this point the advent of <span class="accented">another angel</span> ushers in the following incidents (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>). He is probably <span class="accented">another angel</span> as distinguished from the <span class="accented">sixth angel</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>). There is not sufficient reason for supposing that Christ is meant. Wherever our Lord is referred to in the Revelation, it is always in a mode which cannot possibly be mistaken (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>, etc.). St. John's position is now upon the earth. In the vision he is either in heaven or on the earth, as required, he thus <span class="accented">sees</span> the angel apparently coming down from heaven. Clothed with a cloud. The symbol of majesty (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/16-10.htm">Exodus 16:10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-27.htm">Luke 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.</span> Omit "was." The description shows the celestial dignity of the messenger. Perhaps there is a reference in the <span class="accented">rainbow</span> to the merciful character of this angel's mission, and the faithfulness and patience of God. The two last clauses express the same idea, viz. the bright and glorious appearance of the angel. God's glory is reflected in his messenger, as formerly it was in Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and <i>his</i> left <i>foot</i> on the earth,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he had in his hand a little book open</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "having," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "he had," in a few cursives, the Vulgate, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius. The meaning is the same. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "little book," is a diminutive of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>), which is itself a diminutive of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This form of the word is found nowhere else; the corresponding usual form is <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The book is probably <span class="accented">little</span> in comparison with that in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>. The latter contained all God's purposes, and the seer was not permitted to read it - only part was indicated to him. This book contains only a small portion of God's methods of dealing with man, and St. John is commanded to receive the whole. The contents are indicated in ver. 11 and the following chapter. The book is <span class="accented">open</span>, as a sign that what is contained therein is to be revealed. Bede thinks the New Testament is signified by it; Wordsworth sees in it the spiritual power of Rome; Hengstenberg considers that it contains the judgment of the degenerate Church. <span class="cmt_word">And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth.</span> Thus it is indicated that the revelation which is to follow affects the whole world, and is not partial in its operation, as were the judgments set forth under the earlier trumpets. Wordsworth (following Hengstenberg) sees in the <span class="accented">earth</span> an emblem of worldly power, and in the <span class="accented">sea</span> a symbol of the agitation and turbulence of nations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">And cried with a loud voice, as <i>when</i> a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth;</span> <span class="accented">and be cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth</span> (Revised Version). What the angel <span class="accented">cried we</span> are apparently not told. Probably the whole incident is intended merely to set forth the powerful and terrible nature of the messenger who is to deliver God's message. The figure is a very common one with the prophetical writers (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices;</span> <span class="accented">and when he cried, the seven</span>, etc. (Revised Version). This, again, is a repetition of the idea contained in the preceding clause. The Jews were accustomed to call thunder the seven voices, and to regard it as the voice of the Lord (cf. the repetition in <a href="../../par/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>.), in the same way that they regarded lightning as the fire of God (<a href="../../par/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>). We have, therefore, most probably, a national idea of the Jews, made use of to express the simple fact of the loud and mighty character of the utterance of the angel (cf. the note on <span class="accented">Euphrates</span> in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>). If this be so, it is unnecessary to seek for any more subtle interpretation of <span class="accented">the seven thunders</span>, as that they represent the seven crusades (Vitringa), etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write;</span> <span class="accented">and when the seven thunders spoke, I was</span>, etc. It seems that St. John, in his vision, thought himself to be writing down the incidents as they were displayed before him. This he supposed himself to be doing in obedience to the command in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11, 19</a>. He accordingly is proceeding to do so here, when he is stopped by the angel. <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me.</span> Omit "unto me," with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, all the versions, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius, etc. Throughout the Apocalypse we find frequent mention of <span class="accented">a voice</span>, without any definite statement as to the possessor. In <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11, 12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5, 15</a>, the <span class="accented">voice</span> appears to be that of Christ or God the Father. In <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a> it may be that of Christ or an angel; in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> it seems to be the angel's voice; and in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a> it apparently proceeds from the four living beings; while in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>, although the command appears to be the command of God, the locality from which the voice issues appears to bear reference to the souls of the saints, and their cry for vengeance. Here it seems best to identify the "voice from heaven" with that of <a href="../../par/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, where it is probably Christ himself (see on Revelation 1:10). <span class="cmt_word">Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, "But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end;" also <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power;" also <a href="../../par/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>, "And he saith unto me. Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand"). As stated in the note on ver. 2, not all God's purposes are revealed. Here we have a positive indication that some truths are withheld. It is useless to speculate on the nature of that which is purposely concealed from us. The probable conclusions which we may deduce are well put by Alford: "From the very character of thunder, that the utterances were of fearful import; from the place which they hold, that they relate to the Church; from the command to conceal them, first, encouragement, that God in his tender mercy to his own does not reveal all his terrors; secondly, godly fear, seeing that the arrows of his quiver are not exhausted, but besides things expressly foretold, there are more behind not revealed to us." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/10-5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven</span>; <span class="accented">the right hand</span> (Revised Version) is supported by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, P, Syriac, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius. It is omitted in the Textus Receptus, which follows A, 1, 17, 36, Vulgate; cf. <a href="../../par/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>, a chapter also referred to in the preceding note (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). In Daniel both hands are uplifted, here only one; in the other is the book. The action was customary among the Jews in swearing (see <a href="../../par/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>).

Who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein. Though the balance of authority is in favour of the last clause, yet it is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;</span>, A, and some cursives (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). These two characteristics of God - his eternity and his omnipotence - are referred to in order to demonstrate the certainty of the fulfilment of the prophecy which follows. That there should be time no longer (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">that time no longer shall be.</span> This may be rendered: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Time (a finite terminable period, as opposed to eternity) shall no longer exist, but eternity shall be entered upon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There shall be no more time, in the sense of "there shall be no longer any delay" in the infliction of the last judgment, set forth under the seventh trumpet. The solution seems to be that both meanings are implied. There seems to be a reference to the words of <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>, to the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, during which the saints were to rest and await the infliction of God's wrath upon the ungodly. The visions of the first six trumpets have shown how, in the period of the world's existence, the ungodly do not escape judicial retribution. But that is not all; the force of the six judgments not having served to reduce the worldly to repentance, there can be no more delay, the last final judgment follows. But the last judgment, which follows quickly upon the other six (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-14.htm">Revelation 11:14</a>), is for eternity (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>). The advent of this woe is, therefore, simultaneous with the end of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">"time,"</span> by which we signify that definite period, cut out of eternity, as it were, which is coeval with the existence of the world, and ceases with its destruction. The expression, therefore, implies, "The measure of God's punishments, viewed as opportunities for repentance, is exhausted; there is a limit to his endurance; the allotted time having been run, and his mercy to a large extent having been spurned, there is no more delay;" then falls the last final blow, which is at the end of "time," and at the beginning (for many) of eternity. Ebrard renders, "A space of time in which to repent" - a meaning compatible with the explanation given above. Others render, "The time of the fulfilment shall not be yet, but it shall be when the seventh trumpet sounds;" but this interpretation makes <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> equal <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Others, again, have made <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">a chronus</span>, equal a definite number of years, and have endeavoured to compute the exact equivalent of the period (see Bengel, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/10-7.htm">Revelation 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel.</span> The meaning naturally seems to be, "There shall be no longer time; but, on the contrary, in the days of the seventh trumpet, the last judgment shall tall, the end will come, and all things will be made manifest; the mystery of God will be finished." Wordsworth renders, "No delay, save only in the days," etc., and believes that the passage points to a brief respite, during which men may yet repent. <span class="cmt_word">When he shall begin to sound</span>; <span class="accented">when he is about to sound</span> [his trumpet]. Alford points out the propriety of the expression. "When the seventh angel does sound, the completed time of the fulfilment is simultaneous with his blowing (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>), so that it is properly said that the fulfilment comes in the days when he is about to blow." <span class="cmt_word">The mystery of God should be finished;</span> <span class="accented">also</span> (or <span class="accented">then</span>, as Revised Version) <span class="accented">the mystery of God was fulfilled.</span> "The prophetic past" (Wordsworth). "The mystery of God" is all that man does not now understand in connection with God's dealings with man, but of the existence of which he is cognizant, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the existence of evil in the world, and God's modes of dealing with that and all mankind, which we only know in part. God's plans are being steadily and surely worked out, though we are not able to comprehend them. <span class="cmt_word">As he hath declared to his servants the prophets</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as he evangelized his servants the prophets</span>; <span class="accented">or</span>, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.</span> Thus <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." The promise of the complete fulfilment of the mystery of God is good news indeed for the fainting Christian, for it tells of the end of his trials and the overthrow of his enemies.

The voice, viz. that mentioned in ver. 4, which is probably that of Christ himself (see on ver. 4).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book.

But he is probably, in his vision, already on the earth (see on ver. 1). And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; <span class="accented">he saith.</span> This part of the vision is founded on <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-3:3</a>. The act is no doubt intended to convey the idea that the seer is to carefully receive, to digest thoroughly, as it were, his message in order to deriver it faithfully. Thus in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10</a> the prophet is told, "All my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them," etc. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey;</span> cf. the vision of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>-3, where the sweetness only is immediately mentioned; but the bitterness is implied later on in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>. The sweetness expresses the pleasure and readiness with which St. John receives his commission; the bitterness symbolizes the grief which possesses him when he thoroughly takes in the nature of his message. The pleasure with which he receives the angel's commands may proceed from joy at the thought that the final overthrow of the wicked is the final deliverance of the saints; or it may be that he feels himself honoured at being chosen as the medium for conveying God's message. Compare the readiness of <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a> to fulfil a similar office, and his subsequent fear and hesitation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>). The bitterness of the seer follows when he realizes the terrible nature of the judgment he is to announce (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>, "For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt"). Various other explanations, more or less allegorical, have been suggested. Thus Andreas explains that the first sweetness of sin is afterwards converted into bitterness. Origen, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "Very sweet is this the book of Scripture when first perceived, but bitter to the conscience within." Maurice supposes that St. John's joy proceeds from the expectation that the book will announce the fall of the great Babel empire of the world, and his disappointment follows when he discovers that it predicts the fall of Jerusalem. Bede explains that the bitterness in the belly indicates the reception by the seer, but the sweetness in the mouth is the declaration to others.

Thou must prophesy again. <span class="accented">Thou retest</span>, because it is laid upon thee by God's command. It is to be done <span class="accented">again</span>, because the seer has already to some extent set forth God's will in the earlier part of the book; and he is now required to proceed with the delivery of his message. "Prophesy" (as in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>) has rather its literal than its derived meaning. It is the telling forth of God's purposes, and may refer to past as well as present or future events. The sentence refers to the announcements made in the following part of the Apocalypse (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Bede and others take it to mean the Gospel of St. John, which was, perhaps, afterwards composed (see Introduction). Victorinus thinks it points to the period of St. John's return from Patmos to Ephesus, where the Apocalypse may have been published. <span class="cmt_word">Before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings;</span> <span class="accented">concerning many peoples</span>, etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, with dative). These are the objects of the prophecy, not the audience. This serves to explain the reference in the preceding sentence. The message is not delivered <span class="accented">to</span>, but <span class="accented">about</span> peoples, etc. The fourfold enumeration seems to point to the breadth of the signification - it embraces the whole of mankind (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). This is the end of what is called by many writers the first episode; the second follows. The incident is often alluded to as the "new commission" of St. John; but it seems less a new commission than a solemn re-enactment of the command delivered in <a href="../../par/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 9"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 11"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/11.htm"><title>Revelation 11 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/11.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/11.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/11-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/10.htm" title="Revelation 10">&#9668;</a> Revelation 11 <a href="../revelation/12.htm" title="Revelation 12">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a></div><div class="verse">And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was given me a reed like unto a rod.</span> We are not told by whom the <span class="accented">reed</span> is given, but in <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. the angel has the reed, and so also in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>, upon which the incident seems founded (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>; and cf. the reference to the outer court in ver. 17). The reed is "like a rod;" that is, like to a <span class="accented">staff.</span> It is for a measuring line, as in <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And the angel stood, saying.</span> Omit all except "saying," as in the Revised Version. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is used absolutely, not as qualifying <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "reed," as Andreas (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-6.htm">Revelation 19:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Rise, and measure the temple of God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">rouse and measure</span>, etc. The imperative verb does not imply anything as to the previous position of St. John. "The temple" is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the shrine or dwelling place of God (as in ver. 19; also <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>), the inner temple, as distinguished from the <span class="accented">outer court</span> next mentioned. It scarcely seems possible to doubt that <span class="accented">the temple</span> is here figuratively used of the faithful portion of the Church of Christ. The word is plainly thus used in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> and Revelation 7:15; and is frequently found with this signification in St. Paul's writings, which were probably known to St. John. Dusterdieck and others think that St. John refers literally to the temple at Jerusalem, and to the earthly Jerusalem. But, if so, this portion of the Apocalypse stands self condemned as a prediction which was falsified within a year or two of its enunciation; for in ver. 13 it is expressly stated that the tenth part of the city fell. And nowhere else in the book do Jerusalem and the temple signify the earthly places. The object of the measurement is generally thought to be to set apart or mark off that which is measured from that which is felt without; but opinions vary as to why the temple is thus set apart, some thinking that it is the literal temple which is given over to destruction, others believing that the measuring is a token of the preservation of the Church of God. But may not the command have been given to St. John in order to direct his attention to the size of the Church of God? This is the common meaning of the expression throughout the Bible; it is so in <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-5</a>, a passage upon which this is possibly founded; and it is so in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15</a>. Moreover, there seems a good explanation of the reason why such an incident, thus explained, should occur here. The six trumpets have spoken of the large portions of mankind against whom they were directed; the sixth has declared that men did nevertheless not repent. The seventh trumpet is about to announce yet more terrible woe for the worldly; and, previous to this, a brief but vivid description is given of the oppression to be suffered by the Church - a description inserted here in order to lead up to, and demonstrate the absolute necessity for, the terrible final judgment. Among the ungodly are even some who are nominally members of the Church, who are typified by the <span class="accented">outer court.</span> No one could be more conscious that only a portion of the Church - "the elect" - was to be saved than the writer of the Epistles to the seven Churches (<a href="../../par/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1-3</a>.). Might not the seer and his hearers be inclined to ask, "Who, then, can be saved? Are there any who escape when so much is said about the punishment in store for men?" In answer to such questions, the seer is bidden to remember, what is apt to be forgotten in the dejection caused by the contemplation of the huge amount of wickedness which undoubtedly exists in the world, viz. the large number of good men who form God's staple. It is to be noticed, also, that no mention is made of the command being actually carried out. It is as if the uttering of the command were sufficient to direct the attention of St. John to the fact which was to be conveyed to him, and that, therefore, the necessity for carrying out the injunction existed no longer. It therefore seems probable that "the temple" must be interpreted symbolically. It is the dwelling place of God, the place in which he is worshipped; that is, the multitude of true believers, or the faithful Church. St. John is bidden to measure it, in order to sustain the faith and hope of himself and his hearers. It is placed in antithesis to the <span class="accented">outer court</span>, the faithless portion of the visible Church of God, which is given over to the Gentiles - the type of all that is worldly. <span class="cmt_word">And the altar, and them that worship therein.</span> The altar of incense alone stood within the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; but this may be only an accessory detail in the general description, and not to be pressed to a particular interpretation. "Them that worship therein" directs our thoughts to the individual members of the one body which collectively is "the temple." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty <i>and</i> two months.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles;</span> <span class="accented">it hath been given</span> (Revised Version). Not merely "leave out," but "cast out." The "court which is without the temple" was entered only by Jews. It seems, therefore, here to signify part of the Church, but that part which is separated from the inner circle of true believers, and given over to the world, which is here symbolized by "the Gentiles." The <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, the <span class="accented">nations</span>, throughout the Apocalypse, signifies either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> all mankind whatsoever; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that portion of mankind which is left when the true Church of God is withdrawn, and therefore which embraces the unrighteous part of mankind in contrast to the godly (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>; 22:22). The latter is the signification here. And the holy city shall they tread underfoot. The holy city - Jerusalem - always in the Apocalypse the type of the Church. "They shall tread" need not necessarily refer to "the nations," though the context naturally leads to this signification; but it may be impersonal, amounting to no more than "the holy city shall be trodden underfoot." St. John seems to apply the words of our Lord concerning the literal Jerusalem to the description of the fate in store for the typical Jerusalem (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>). "The nations" are the instrument by which the Church is trodden underfoot, and the mention of the Gentiles in connection with the apostate portion of the Church leads to the description of the oppression of the faithful by the world. The seer is bidden to take courage by a contemplation of the numbers of those preserved by God, but is warned, nevertheless, not to expect from that fact immunity for the Church from the persecution of the world. <span class="cmt_word">Forty and two months</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, "and," is inserted contrary to the common practice when the larger number precedes (so also in <a href="../../par/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>). This period of three years and a half is certainly symbolical. It is the half of seven years - a perfect number. It therefore denotes a broken, uncertain period; a space of time which is certainly finite, but the end of which is uncertain. This seems to point necessarily to the period of the world's existence during which the Church is to suffer oppression. This period is mentioned <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in ver. 3 under the form of twelve hundred and sixty days, where it denotes the same period that is referred to here; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a> as twelve hundred and sixty days, and in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a> as "a time, and times, and half a time," in both of which passages the signification is the same as that given above; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a> it is called, as here, forty-two months, and describes the same period. The expression is founded on <a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> and Daniel 12:7. In the latter place the time signified is certainly the period of the world's existence. We therefore see <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that its natural meaning, in connection with the number seven, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its signification in Daniel, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its apparent use in all passages in the Apocalypse, tend to cause us to interpret the symbol as above. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I will give <i>power</i> unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred <i>and</i> threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will give power unto my two witnesses.</span> Omit "power." What is given follows, viz. "they shall prophesy," etc. The voice, speaking in the name of Christ, says, <span class="accented">"My:</span> The two witnesses of me;" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "the," as though they were well known. There is much diversity of interpretation in regard to "the two witnesses." It seems reasonable to understand the two witnesses as representative of the elect Church of God (embracing both Jewish and Christian) and of the witness which she bears concerning God, especially in the Old and New Testaments. The following considerations seem to support this interpretation: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The vision is evidently founded on that in <a href="../../par/zechariah/4.htm">Zechariah 4</a>, where it is emblematical of the restored temple, which only in the preceding verse (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>) is a type of the elect of God's Church (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Apocalypse continually represents the Church of God, after the pattern of the life of Christ, in three aspects - that of conflict and degradation; that of preservation; that of triumph (see Professor Milligan's Baird Lectures, 'The Revelation of St. John,' lect. 2 and 5.). This is a summary of the vision here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Much of the Apocalypse follows our Lord's description in <a href="../../par/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>. In that chapter (vers. 13, 14) we have, "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." Again, a brief description of this vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is not probable that two individuals are meant; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> as we have shown throughout the Apocalypse, the application is invariably to principles and societies, though this may include particular applications in certain cases; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> it is inconceivable that Moses and Elias, or any other of the saints of God, should return from Paradise to suffer as these two witnesses; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> our Lord expressly explained the reference to the coming of Elias, and declared that he had already come; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> there seems no more reason for interpreting these two witnesses literally of two men, than for interpreting Sodom and Egypt in their ordinary geographical signification in ver. 8. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The details of the fate of the two witnesses agree with the interpretation given - the whole vision being understood as symbolical. Thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the picture of the two witnesses is evidently formed after the pattern of Moses and Elias, on account of the conspicuous witness they bore and the hardship they suffered, as well as their preservation and final vindication. Moreover, Moses and Elias are typical of the Law and the prophets, or the Scriptures - the means (as stated above) by which the Church chiefly bears witness of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The time during which they prophesy; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the clothing in sackcloth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the appellation of candlesticks and olive trees; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> their power to hurt; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> their apparent death; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(g)</span> the torment they cause; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(h)</span> their resuscitation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(i)</span> their vindication; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(k)</span> the immediate advent of the final judgment; - all agree (as shown below) with the interpretation given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Witness is constantly connected in the Apocalypse and elsewhere with the Church, and generally with suffering, sometimes with triumph (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2, 5, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> In <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a> we are told, "The testimony [witness] of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy," exactly the quality with which the two witnesses are credited (ver. 3), and which is the work of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall prophesy;</span> that is, "prophesy" in its literal meaning of forthtelling God's will and his judgments on the wicked, and so of preaching repentance. This is emphatically the work of the Church, and is accomplished chiefly through the Scriptures. It is this prophesying that torments (see vers. 5, 10). <span class="cmt_word">A thousand two hundred</span> and <span class="cmt_word">three score days.</span> Or, forty and two months (ver. 2). During the period of the world's existence (see on ver. 2) the Church, although "trodden underfoot," will not cease to "prophesy." <span class="cmt_word">Clothed in sackcloth.</span> Thus, symbolically, is expressed the same fact as in ver. 2. The Church there is "trodden underfoot" during the period of the world; here it is said that she is to perform her office during this time "clothed in sackcloth." The treatment by the world of both the Church of God and the Word of God is represented by the apparel of mourning and woe, which is the lot of the Church on earth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-4.htm">Revelation 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks.</span> The "two olive trees" and the "two candlesticks" are here identical. Thus, while St. John uses the figure of Zechariah, he does not apply it in every detail. In the prophet, but one candlestick is mentioned. "The two olive trees," which supply the material for the candlesticks, are fit emblems of the Old and New Testaments; the candlesticks typify the Jewish and Christian Churches. These are identical so far as being God's witnesses; the Church derives her stores from the Word of God, the light of the Word of God is manifested through the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Standing before the God of the earth;</span> <span class="accented">the Lord of the earth</span> (Revised Version). The participle is masculine, though the preceding article and nouns are feminine, probably as being more in keeping with the masculine character under which the two witnesses are depicted. Perhaps he is described as the "Lord of the earth," since the witnesses are to prophesy before all the earth (cf. ver. 9 and <a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies;</span> <span class="accented">if any one willeth to hurt them</span>, etc. Most probably a reference to the act of Elijah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a>). Perhaps there is a double reference in the <span class="accented">fire proceeding out of their mouth</span>; it is the <span class="accented">fire</span> of their witness, which refines and purifies and convinces some; it is also the fire of condemnation, which follows those who reject the testimony. The figure is found in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>, "I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them" (see also <a href="../../par/hosea/6-5.htm">Hosea 6:5</a>; Ecclus. 48:1). <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed;</span> <span class="accented">any one shall will</span> (future) is read in the Revised Version, and is supported by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, 38; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, (present) is found in B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas. "In this manner;" that is, by <span class="accented">fire</span>. Such, throughout the Scriptures, is the form under which the final judgment of those who reject God's message is shadowed forth. The description is not more opposed to a general interpretation than it is to an individual interpretation of the two witnesses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-6.htm">Revelation 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will;</span> <span class="accented">the power</span>...  <span class="accented">the heaven</span>...  <span class="accented">the waters</span>...  <span class="accented">every plague</span> (Revised Version). The whole verse is descriptive of the powers entrusted to Moses and Elijah, and is intended to convey the idea that the power which supported them would likewise support the two witnesses. It is doubtful whether the meaning should be pressed further than this. If we do so, it may, perhaps, be said that (in the words of Wordsworth) "if any one despises God's witnesses, they have the power, like Elias, to shut heaven, and exclude all who reject them. The dews of Divine grace are withheld from all who scorn them." It is thus a fulfilment of our Lord's words, "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>). And again, besides the punishments which are finally to fall on the ungodly, it is the case that the rejection of God's will is followed on this earth by troubles which would be avoided were men to listen to the witness borne of him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they shall have finished their testimony.</span> This is a difficult passage. How can the Church's testimony be said to be <span class="accented">finished</span> while the earth still exists? The explanation seems to lie in the words of our Lord, "When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" (<a href="../../par/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a>). Christians are forewarned that, as the ages roll on, faith will wane. Though the Church be apparently destroyed, she is not really dead, but will rise again. As our Lord, after finishing his testimony, completed his work by his death and subsequent ascension, so the time will come when the Church shall have Completed all that is necessary, by offering to the world her testimony, and shall then be so completely rejected as to appear dead. Her enemies will rejoice, but their time of rejoicing is cut short (see below). After three and a half days comes her vindication, and her enemies are struck with consternation; for it is the end, and they have no further opportunities for repentance. Thus Heugstenberg says, "They shall only be overcome when they have finished their testimony, when God has no further need for their service, when their death can produce more fruit than their life." <span class="cmt_word">The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them;</span> <span class="accented">the beast that cometh up out of the abyss.</span> The article points to <span class="accented">the</span> beast which is described elsewhere in the Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>), and which is mentioned here by proleipsis. "The fourth beast," which is read in A, may have <span class="accented">been</span> suggested by <a href="../../par/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> has "the beast which then cometh up." The <span class="accented">beast</span> is Satan, perhaps manifested in the form of the persecuting world power (see on Revelation 13:1). His nature is indicated by the use of the noun <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "a wild beast," the opposite, as Wordsworth says, of <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the Lamb. The beast ascends out of the abyss for a brief reign upon the earth, and is "drunken with the blood of the saints," as described in <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, but he ascends only to go into perdition (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>). It is well to remember that the whole vision is symbolical. The intention is to convey the idea that the Church, in her witness for God, will experience opposition from the power of Satan, which will wax more and more formidable as time goes on, and result in the apparent triumph of the forces of evil. But the triumph will be brief; it will but usher in the end and the final subjugation of the devil.

Here we are plainly told the <span class="accented">spiritual</span>, that is, the symbolical nature of the designation. <span class="accented">Sodom</span> and <span class="accented">Egypt are</span> chosen as the type of what is evil (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>, etc.). It was in this city, that is, by the influence of this world power, that the Lord was crucified. In describing the fate of the Church, St. John seems to have in mind the life of Christ. His witness, the opposition he encountered, his death for a brief time at the completion of his work, his resurrection and ascension, and triumph over the devil, are all here reproduced. "The bodies lie in the street" symbolizes, according to Jewish custom, the most intense scorn and hatred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-9.htm">Revelation 11:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves</span>; <span class="accented">and from among the peoples and tribes</span>, etc., <span class="accented">do</span> [men] <span class="accented">look upon</span>, etc., <span class="accented">and suffer not</span>, etc., <span class="accented">in a tomb</span> (Revised Version).

The period is but three days and a half; again, as in vers. 2, 3, a broken, that is, a finite but uncertain period; but, as compared with the three years and a half - the period of the world's existence - very short. (On the signification of the last clause, see on ver. 8.) It is the usual Eastern mark of contempt and degradation. The whole verse, together with the preceding and succeeding verses, describes symbolically, but graphically, the scorn and contempt to which the Church and God's Word will be subjected by men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-10.htm">Revelation 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth;</span> <span class="accented">rejoice and make merry, that dwell</span> (present, though future in meaning; the present tense rendering the description more graphic). Those dwelling on the earth are the ungodly, the worldly. "They send gifts," in accordance with Oriental custom on joyful occasions (cf. ver. 9). "The prophets, the witnesses, tormented;" probably rather by the delivery of their message, which would affect the conscience of men, than by the plagues referred to in ver. 6, though both may be meant. Alford, Bengel, and Dusterdieck favour the latter view of the two; Hengstenberg takes the former. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-11.htm">Revelation 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.</span> "The three days and an half," viz. these mentioned in ver. 9, which see.

Dusterdieck, who reads, "I heard," points out that in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, the phrase used in addressing others is, "It was said unto them." Thus the fate of the Church is that of her Lord, and it is the fate of each individual who may witness of God. Suffering, apparent extinction, perhaps, but ultimate triumph and ascension into the presence of God is their common inheritance. If so be that they suffer with him, they are also glorified with him (<a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). Alford remarks that "no attempt has been made to explain this ascension by those who interpret the witnesses figuratively of the Old and New Testaments, or the like." Is it not the resurrection of the just, of the witnesses of God, and their exaltation at the beginning of the last judgment? Thus St. Paul says, "But each in his own order: Christ the Firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming. Then cometh the end" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13</a>). This "end" is immediately referred to by the seer. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them; <span class="accented">in the cloud.</span> The parallelism with Elijah and Christ (see vers. 5, 6, 8) is carried still further. The Church is triumphantly vindicated and glorified as they were; the only difference is that now all men behold it. <span class="accented">The cloud</span> is not that which hides them from view, but rather, like that in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>, something which exalts and enhances the glory of the witnesses. The effect upon the worldly is told in vers. 11, 13. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the same hour was there a great earthquake.</span> In the visions of the seals it is set forth, under the sixth seal, how the destruction of the world is accompanied by earthquakes, etc.; the fear of the wicked is portrayed, and the preservation of the just takes place at the same time. Here, under the sixth trumpet, we have the same events shown forth, the triumph of the godly being mentioned first, though the rest happens "in that same hour." This is the conclusion of the sixth judgment, the consequence of the non repentance mentioned in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>. The intervening narrative (<a href="../../par/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-11:12</a>) serves to show that opportunities of knowing God's will are given to men, as well as warnings of judgment in ease of disobedience. Vers. 13 of <a href="../../par/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>. might follow <a href="../../par/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>, but for the desire of the seer to demonstrate the long suffering goodness and mercy of God. And the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand. Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version have in the margin, "names of men, seven thousand," and some writers make much of the expression. Thus Alford says, "As if the name of each were recounted;" and Wordsworth, "Persons known and distinguished." But, in truth, the phrase is a Hebraism, to which we can attach no special significance (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). Whatever may he the system of interpretation adopted, this passage presents many difficulties. The whole account appears to relate to the judgment day, and it is therefore more peculiarly prophetic than many parts of the Apocalypse, and for that reason its meaning must needs be more or less obscure. The account in this verse informs us that a part (a tenth) of the city (that is, of the wicked) suffers destruction; that the number so destroyed is described as seven thousand; that the rest (nine tenths), in fear, recognize the power of God, to which they had hitherto refused attention. What is the final fate awarded to the nine tenths we are not told. We have, therefore, to inquire the meaning of the numbers given. Now, it seems inherently impossible to interpret these numbers literally, and, moreover, as we have repeatedly seen, it is not the habit of the writer of the Apocalypse to indicate exact numbers. We must, therefore, try to discover the symbolical meaning which St. John attached to these expressions, the qualities rather than the quantities which he intended to signify. In the Bible <span class="accented">the tenth part</span> invariably signifies the tithe - the portion due from the community to God or to the ruler (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-32.htm">Leviticus 27:32</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15, 17</a>). it seems probable that this was the idea intended to be conveyed, viz. that God was now exacting his due, that men who had refused to recognize what was due from them to God were now forced to recognize his sovereignty by the exaction for punishment of a tithe, and as an evidence that all are under his sway. But, it may be objected, are not all the wicked punished at the judgment? This verse really seems to hint at a possibility of some course by which, even at the last moment, a chance of escape may be presented to men. But it does not distinctly state this; it seems, indeed, purposely to leave the fate of the rest of the ungodly untold. All it does assert is that God comes to the wicked as a Conqueror or a King, and exacts what is due to himself. But, further, why are <span class="accented">seven thousand</span> men slain? Again interpreting symbolically, <span class="accented">seven</span> involves the idea of completeness (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). A thousand signifies a large number, though not an infinitely large number, for which we have "thousands of thousands," etc. This number, therefore, informs us that God's vengeance overtakes a large number, and that that number is complete, none escaping who deserve to be included. Perhaps this is mentioned as a precaution against any possibility of mistake in the interpretation of the "tenth part." It is as though St. John would say, "In that hour God exacted vengeance, demanding what was due to his justice; but do not imagine that that vengeance reached only a small part of mankind. It was far extending and complete, though I do not attempt to define its exact limits, which cannot be known until the judgment day itself shall reveal everything." <span class="cmt_word">And the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="accented">The rest gave glory</span>, being, perhaps (though not necessarily), repentant (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a>). Possibly we have here a hint of God's uncovenanted mercies (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), though there is nothing sufficiently definite to encourage men to postpone the day of repentance. No mention is made of the ultimate fate of "the remnant." "The God of heaven," in contrast to things of the world, upon which their affections had been hitherto set (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a>). In these two places alone of the New Testament is this expression found; but it is not uncommon in the Old Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18</a>).

The account describes the natural spiritual punishment which is inflicted upon men in consequence of their sins (<a href="../../par/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13-21</a>). This is insufficient to lead men to avert the final judgment by timely repentance. We have then a further description of God's long suffering, and the rejection of his mercy, accompanied by an assurance of the safety of the faithful (<a href="../../par/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-11:10</a>). This brings us to the end of the world (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-11.htm">Revelation 11:11-14</a>), just as the sixth seal led to the same termination (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12-17</a>), and both are followed by the seventh, which gives a reference to the eternal peace of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.</span> Omit "and." It is not said, in the case of the other "woes," that they come <span class="accented">quickly.</span> In his description of the preservation and glorification of the Church under the form of the "witnesses," the writer had been led to anticipate in some degree what follows under the seventh trumpet. Thus the seventh comes <span class="accented">quickly.</span> When events have progressed so far that the faithful Church is ascended to heaven with her Lord, then immediate]y follows the eternal rest set forth under the seventh trumpet. But this period is described as "the third woe," because it is the period of time final punishment of the wicked; and it is the judgment of the ungodly which is the theme of the trumpet visions, although mention is incidentally made of the preservation and reward of the just. This is the time foretold in <a href="../../par/revelation/10-7.htm">Revelation 10:7</a>. Just as in the case of the seals, the period of the seventh seal is recorded but not described, so here, in the case of the seventh trumpet, its advent is recorded, and its nature is indicated in ver. 18, but no further description is given of the <span class="accented">woe</span>; only a slight reference to the bliss of those who are secure in heaven. Thus St. John does not attempt a complete picture of either the blessings of heaven or the woes of hell.

It naturally follows the account, in vers. 12, 13, of the vindication of God's witnesses, and of the glory rendered by the rest of mankind. With God the Father is associated Christ, by whose means the overthrow of the devil is effected, and by whom his servants overcome (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>).

"The elders" are peculiarly indebted to God, since the establishment of his kingdom is the victory of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come;</span> <span class="accented">the Almighty.</span> Omit "and art to come" (Revised Version), with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius, Syriac, Armenian, etc. (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>). Perhaps the future is purposely omitted, since God's "coming" is now an accomplished fact (cf. also <a href="../../par/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>). Because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned; <span class="accented">because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign</span> (Revised Version). God never ceased to reign, though for a time he abrogated his <span class="accented">power.</span> This <span class="accented">power</span> he has now reassumed, and the elders thank him for it, for it is the assurance of the end of the suffering of the Church of God. So in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> the elders declare that he is worthy to receive the <span class="accented">power</span> which he now visibly exercises. It has, indeed, been exercised before. The preservation of the Church set forth in the visions of the seals, and the punishment of the ungodly shown under the trumpet visions, are effected by means of this power; but now that power is visibly exercised.

"The nations" raged in the period of their persecution of the Church, as set forth under the visions of the seals. They were angry, says Hengstenberg, at the progress of the kingdom of God, after the Word was made flesh. <span class="cmt_word">And thy wrath is come;</span> <span class="accented">thy wrath came.</span> This verse points conclusively to the judgment day, the events of which, however, as before remarked (see on ver. 15), are merely indicated, not fully described.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the temple of God was opened in heaven;</span> <span class="accented">and there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven</span> (Revised Version). "The temple" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), the dwelling place of God (cf. ver. 1; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). Again, but a glimpse is afforded; and yet more is revealed than at the conclusion of the former series of visions; while the chief description is reserved to a later part of the Revelation. <span class="cmt_word">And there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament;</span> or, <span class="accented">ark of his covenant.</span> This seems to be introduced in order to render more emphatic the steadfastness and unchangeableness of God. As in the case of the witnesses, the figure is taken from the Old Testament, and the symbol would be pregnant with meaning to Jewish Christians and ethers who had learnt to think of the ark as the sacrament of God's abiding presence and continual help. He who now promises aid to his people, and threatens judgment upon the wicked, is the same God who formerly had displayed his power on behalf of his people Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail;</span> <span class="accented">there followed</span> (Revised Version). The usual token of any special manifestation of God's presence, or direct dealing with men (see on Revelation 6:1). This, then, forms the conclusion to the series of trumpet visions. These visions, evoked by the cry for vengeance in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>, have demonstrated the need for patience and endurance on the part of Christians, by indicating the punishments meted out to the wicked on this earth and at the final judgment, together with the final triumph of the faithful. The seer next proceeds to elaborate a fact alluded to in the measuring of the temple in <a href="../../par/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>, and to point the moral that it is possible for Christians within the Church to lose their final reward by their apostasy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/12.htm"><title>Revelation 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/11.htm" title="Revelation 11">&#9668;</a> Revelation 12 <a href="../revelation/13.htm" title="Revelation 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there appeared a great wonder;</span> <span class="accented">and a great sign was seen</span> (Revised Version). This <span class="accented">sign</span> consists of the whole of the appearances, the account of which is contained in this verse and the following one. The vision is thus plainly declared to be figurative (cf. the use of the corresponding verb in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In heaven.</span> Though the scene of the vision opens in <span class="accented">heaven</span>, it is immediately afterwards transferred to the earth. It is doubtful whether any particular signification is to be attached to the expression, though Wordsworth notes concerning the Church, "For her origin is from above; hers is the kingdom of heaven." And Bengel, "The woman, the Church, though on earth, is nevertheless, by virtue of her union with Christ, in heaven." <span class="cmt_word">A woman.</span> The <span class="accented">woman</span> is undoubtedly the Church of God; not necessarily limited to the Christian Church, but the whole company of all who acknowledge God, including the heavenly beings in existence before the creation, as well as creation itself. The figure is found both in the Old Testament and in the New. Thus <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5, 6</a>, "For thy Maker is thine Husband .... For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved" (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with the sun.</span> The whole description is intended to portray the glory and beauty of the Church. Most of the ancient commentators give particular interpretations of the symbols employed. Thus the <span class="accented">sun</span> is believed to represent Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. Primasius quotes <a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>, "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." <span class="cmt_word">And the moon under her feet.</span> This is interpreted as showing the permanent nature of the Church; she treads underfoot the moon, the symbol of changing times and seasons. It is thought that a reference is thus intended to the futility of the endeavours made to subvert the Church (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/6-10.htm">Song of Solomon 6:10</a>). Others variously interpret the <span class="accented">moon</span> of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Mosaic Law; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the irreligion of the world; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Mohammedan power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the figure is probably intended simply to enhance the beauty of the vision, and to portray the exceeding glory of the Church. We may also imagine the symbol to denote stability of existence in the midst of change of outward appearance, as the <span class="accented">moon</span> is ever existent and ever reappearing, though obscured for a time. <span class="cmt_word">And upon her head a crown of twelve stars</span>. This image immediately suggests a reference to the twelve apostles of the Christian Church, and the twelve tribes of the Jewish Church. Wordsworth observes, "<span class="accented">Twelve</span> is the <span class="accented">apostolic</span> number, and <span class="accented">stars</span> are emblems of Christian teachers." In like manner the Jews were accustomed to speak of the minor prophets as "the twelve." The <span class="accented">crown</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;</span> the crown of victory - the idea of which is prominent throughout the vision.

A similar image occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>. The trouble which afflicted the Jewish Church, and the longing of the patriarchs for the advent of the Saviour, are here depicted. So also St. Paul, encouraging the Romans to bear patiently their sufferings, says, "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there appeared another wonder in heaven;</span> <span class="accented">and there was seen another sign in heaven</span> (Revised Version). (See on ver. 1.) The appearance seen is not a representation of the devil as he actually is, but the sign - the dragon - is figurative and descriptive of the particular characteristics now about to be exhibited. <span class="accented">In heaven</span> - most likely merely <span class="accented">in the space above</span>, where he could be easily seen. Wordsworth, however, says, "Because the power here represented assails the Church, the kingdom of <span class="accented">heaven."</span> And behold a great red dragon. His identity is established by ver. 9, where he is called "the great dragon, the old serpent, the devil, Satan, the deceiver." <span class="accented">Red</span>; no doubt to enhance his terrible appearance; suggestive of his murderous, destructive character. <span class="accented">"Dragon"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>,) in the New Testament occurs only in this book. In the Old Testament the word is of frequent occurrence. In the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is used seventeen times to express the Hebrew <span class="accented">tannin</span> (a sea or land monster, especially a crocodile or serpent); five times it stands for <span class="accented">leviathan</span>; twice it represents <span class="accented">kephir</span> (young lion); twice <span class="accented">nachash</span> (serpent); once <span class="accented">attud</span> (he-goat); and once <span class="accented">pethen</span> (python). <span class="accented">Tannin</span> (singular) is always rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> except in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, where we find <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; but twice it is corrupted into <span class="accented">tannim</span> (viz. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>). The latter word, <span class="accented">tannim</span>, is the plural of <span class="accented">tan</span> (a jackal), and is found only in the plural; but once it is found corrupted into <span class="accented">tannin</span> (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>). There is no doubt as to the signification of the appearance. The <span class="accented">dragon</span>, is, in the Old Testament, invariably a symbol of what is harmful, tyrannous, murderous. It is a hideous, sanguinary monster, sometimes inhabiting the sea, sometimes the desolate places of the earth, always "seeking whom it may devour." In some passages it refers to Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>); in others it is a type of what is noxious or desolate (<a href="../../par/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>, etc.). In <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a> we have the combination, "leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent;...  the dragon that is in the sea." <span class="cmt_word">Having seven heads and ten horns.</span> The description of the beasts in <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12-17</a>, is evidently derived from the vision of Daniel (7.), although the details differ. It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the interpretation generally should follow the same lines as that applied to the Old Testament symbols, with which the writer was so familiar. The appearances described in Daniel are universally considered to typify various worldly powers which oppressed the Church and nation of the Jews. Similarly here the symbolism seems intended to portray the opposition of the devil to the Church of God, working through the power of the world. The heads and horns are both declared in <a href="../../par/revelation/17-10.htm">Revelation 17:10, 12</a> to typify kingdoms - in what way we shall presently see (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-10.htm">Revelation 17:10</a>). The numbers <span class="accented">seven</span> and <span class="accented">ten</span> are both symbolical of completeness (see <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>). We have, therefore, in this picture of the dragon, the idea of the full and complete power of the world arrayed on earth against God and his Church. This power, connected with and derived from the devil, the prince of this world (<a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>), is often alluded to by St. John as being opposed to, or in contrast with, the godly (see <a href="../../par/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15.htm">John 15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16.htm">John 16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17.htm">John 17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And seven crowns upon his heads;</span> <span class="accented">seven diadems</span> (Revised Version). That is, the kingly crown, the symbol of sovereignty, worn by the dragon to denote his power as "prince of this world." The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is found in the New Testament only here and <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> and Revelation 19:12. It is not the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the crown of victory worn by the saints (see <a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>, etc.). No account is given of the disposition and arrangement of the heads, horns, and diadems; nor is it necessary. The seven crowned heads signify universal sovereignty; the ten horns, absolute power. Probably those to whom St. John wrote understood the symbol as referring specially to the power of heathen Rome, which was at that time oppressing the Church; but the meaning extends to the power of the world in all ages (see on Revelation 13:1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth</span>; <span class="accented">draweth</span> (Revised Version). Not the <span class="accented">stars</span> with which the woman is crowned (see ver. 1), but other <span class="accented">stars.</span> In describing the vast power of the devil, St. John seems to allude to the tremendous result of his rebellious conduct in heaven, in effecting the fall of other angels with himself (<a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). The seer does not here interrupt his narrative to explain the point, but returns to it after ver. 6, and there describes briefly the origin and cause of the enmity of the devil towards God. The <span class="accented">third part</span> (as in <a href="../../par/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>) signifies a considerable number, but not the larger part. <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born;</span> <span class="accented">which was about to be delivered, that when she was delivered, he might devour her child</span> (Revised Version). A graphic picture of what is true of Christ himself of the Church, both Jewish and Christian, and of every individual member of the Church. This is another example of the personal history of Christ being repeated in the history of his Church. The devil, in the person of Herod, attempts to prevent the salvation of the world; through Pharaoh he endeavours to crush the chosen people of God, through whom the Messiah was to bless all the earth; by means of the power of Rome he labours to exterminate the infant Church of Christ.

This reference and <a href="../../par/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> leave no doubt as to the identification of the man child. It is Christ who is intended. The same expression is used of him in <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>, where he is definitely called the "Word of God." <span class="cmt_word">And her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</span> The sentence seems plainly to refer to the ascension of Christ and his subsequent abiding in heaven, from whence he rules all nations. The seer, perhaps, wishes to indicate at once the absolute immunity of Christ from any harm proceeding from the power of the devil, whose efforts are henceforth directly aimed only at the Church of Christ. Satan still hopes to injure Christ through his members. As remarked above (see on ver. 4), what is true of the personal history of Christ is often true of his Church and of his true members. And thus some have seen in this passage a picture of the woman, the Church, bringing forth members, to devour whom is Satan's constant purpose, but who in God's good time are taken to his throne to be near himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred <i>and</i> threescore days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the woman fled into the wilderness.</span> As with Christ, so with his Church. His great trial took place in the wilderness; so the trial of the Church occurs in the wilderness, by which figure the world is typified. It is generally pointed out that this verse is here inserted in anticipation of ver. 14. We prefer rather to look upon it as occurring in its natural place, the narrative being interrupted by vers. 7-13 in order to account for the implacable hostility of the devil. <span class="cmt_word">Where she hath a place prepared of God</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, P, and others insert <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "where she there hath," etc. - a redundancy which is an ordinary Hebraism. Though the Church is "in the world," she is not "of the world" (<a href="../../par/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14, 15</a>); though the woman is in the "wilderness," her place is "prepared of God." The harlot's abode (<a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>.) is in the wilderness, and it is also of the wilderness; it is not in a place specially prepared of God. <span class="cmt_word">That they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.</span> The sense is the same as in ver. 14, "that she should be sustained there." The interpretation of the 1260 days, or 3.5 years, coincides here with that adopted in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>. It describes the period of this world's existence, during the whole of which the devil persecutes the Church of God. As Auberlen points out, this is, in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>, declared to be "the period of the power of the beast, that is, the world power." (For a discussion of the whole subject of this period, see on Revelation 11:2.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was war in heaven</span>. The passage vers. 7-13 is an interruption of the narrative of the persecution of the woman by Satan. It is caused, apparently, by a desire to account in some degree for the relentless hostility of the devil towards God and his Church. Two explanations of the passage may be referred to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 7-13 relate to the period anterior to the Creation, concerning which we have a slight hint in <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>. This, on the whole, seems to agree best with the general sense of the chapter, and to present fewest difficulties. Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> It accounts for the insertion of the passage (see above). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The war is directly between the devil and Michael, not between the devil and Christ, as at the Incarnation and Resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Vers. 8 and 9 seem to require a more literal interpretation than that which makes them refer to the effects of Christ's resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> It was not at the period of the Incarnation that the scene of Satan's opposition was transferred to the earth, as described in ver. 12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The song of the heavenly voice may be intended to end with the word Christ (ver. 10), and the following passages may be the words of the writer of the Apocalypse, and may refer to the earthly martyrs (see on ver. 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> This attempt of the devil in heaven may be alluded to in <a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, "The darkness overcame it not" (see also <a href="../../par/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The passage may refer to the incarnation and resurrection of Christ, and the victory then won over the devil. This interpretation renders the whole passage much more figurative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Michael is the type of mankind, which in the Person of Jesus Christ vanquishes the devil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Subsequent to the Resurrection Satan is no more allowed to accuse men before God in heaven, as he has done previously (see <a href="../../par/job/1.htm">Job 1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-22</a>); he is thus the accuser cast down (ver. 10), and his place is no more found in heaven (ver. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The earth and sea represent the worldly and tumultuous nations. Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of the second view is found in <a href="../../par/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a> and <a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Michael and his angels fought against the dragon;</span> <span class="accented">Michael and his angels</span> [<span class="accented">going forth</span>] <span class="accented">to war with the dragon</span> (Revised Version). Alford explains the infinitive phrase as compounded of the genitive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and depending upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. <span class="accented">Michael</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5db;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>) signifies, "Who is like to God?" We may compare this with the cry of the worldly in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>, "Who is like unto the beast?" In Daniel, <span class="accented">Michael</span> is the prince who stands up for the people of Israel (<a href="../../par/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 21</a>). <span class="accented">Michael</span>, "the archangel," is alluded to in <a href="../../par/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a> as the great opposer of Satan. St. John, perhaps borrowing the name from Daniel, puts forward <span class="accented">Michael as</span> the chief of those who remained faithful to the cause of God in the rebellion of Satan and his angels. The <span class="accented">angels</span> of the dragon are the stars of ver. 4, which he drew with him to the earth, and possibly the reference to this event in ver. 4 gives rise to the account in vers. 7-13. Some commentators interpret the war here described as that between the Church and the world. <span class="accented">Michael</span> is thus made to be symbolical of Christ, and some have no difficulty in indicating a particular man (such as Licinius) as the antitype of the dragon. <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</span> The Greek is stronger, <span class="accented">not even their place</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, Andreas, Arethas; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is found in P, 1, 17, and others.

"The dragon:" so called, because he is the destroyer (see on ver. 3). "The ancient serpent," as he was revealed in <a href="../../par/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. So in <a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a> he is "the destroyer from the beginning." "The devil" (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Satan</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, "the accuser, the adversary;" reference is made in ver. 10 to the signification of the name, "The Deceiver." Wordsworth says, "The deceits by which Satan cheated the world in oracles, sorcery, soothsaying, magic, and other frauds, are here specially noticed. These were put to flight by the power of Christ and of the Holy Ghost, in the preaching of the gospel by the apostles and others in the first ages of Christianity. Our Lord himself, speaking of the consequence of the preaching of the seventy disciples, reveals the spiritual struggle and the victory: 'I was beholding Satan as lightning fall from heaven' (<a href="../../par/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17, 18</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him;</span> <span class="accented">cast down to the earth</span>, etc. (Revised Version). "To the earth" in a twofold sense: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the phrase is a description of the loss of dignity and power on the part of Satan, in being cast to <span class="accented">earth</span> as opposed to heaven; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">earth</span> is the scene of his future operations, where he may still in some degree sustain the struggle against God.

"The salvation of God" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is that which proceeds from him; "that salvation which belongs to God as its Author" (Alford); cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-10.htm">Revelation 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a>. "The authority of his Christ" is first manifested in heaven; Satan is cast down to the earth, and here again at a subsequent epoch the <span class="accented">authority of Christ</span> is displayed, and another victory won over the devil. This seems to be the conclusion of the heavenly song. As before stated (see on ver. 7), the three and a half verses now concluded seem to relate to a period previous to the creation of the world. It seems equally probable that the following two and a half verses refer to those earthly martyrs and suffering Christians for whom this book is specially written. These two views can be reconciled by supposing the song of the heavenly <span class="accented">voice</span> to cease at the word "Christ" (ver. 10); and then the writer adds words of his own, as if he would say, "The cause of the victorious song which I have just recited was the fact that the devil was cast down, the same who is constantly accusing (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) our brethren.

Satan does not cease to accuse, though he may not do so with effect, since he may be overcome by the "blood of the Lamb." The heavenly beings are henceforth beyond his reach. He can yet accuse men - our brethren  - says St. John; but even here his power is limited by the victory of the death and resurrection of Christ referred to in ver. 5. "Accuser" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas. The form <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, found in A, is rather the Targumic and rabbinic corruption of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, than the Greek word itself. "Of our brethren," the saints and martyrs (see above); "is cast down" (or, "was cast down") from heaven. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they overcame him</span> (cf. the frequent references to those who overcome, and the promises made to them, <a href="../../par/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a> , etc.). The reference "they" is to "our brethren," the accused ones of ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">By the blood of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">because of the blood</span>, etc. (Revised Version). That is, "the blood of the Lamb" is the ground or reason of their victory, not the instrument.

Winer agrees with this view of the present passage, against Ewald and De Wette (p. 498 of Moulton's translation). "The Lamb," who was seen "as it had been slain" (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>) - Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And by the word of their testimony;</span> <span class="accented">and on account of the word, etc.</span> The one phrase is the natural complement of the other. "The blood of the Lamb" would have been shed in vain without the <span class="accented">testimony</span>, the outcome of the faith of his followers; that <span class="accented">testimony</span> would have been impossible without the shedding of the blood. <span class="cmt_word">And they loved not their lives unto the death;</span> <span class="accented">their life even unto death.</span> That is, they valued not their life in this world, even to the extent of meeting death for the sake of giving their testimony.

The article of the Authorized Version in <a href="../../par/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a> is probably derived from Wickliffe's Bible; that in the present passage, from Tyndale's.

This "short season" is the period of the world's existence from the advent of Satan till the final judgment. It is <span class="accented">short</span> in comparison with eternity, and it is frequently thus described in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/romans/9-28.htm">Romans 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>, etc.). It is the "little time" of <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; the "little season" of <a href="../../par/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, during which Satan must be loosed. Here ends the digression descriptive of the struggle in heaven before the creation of the world, and the following verses take up and continue the narrative which was interrupted after ver. 6.

The interpretation must not be confined to one peculiar form of evil which assails the Church, but must include all - the bodily persecutions with which those to whom St. John wrote were afflicted, the heresies which arose in the Church, the lukewarnmess of her members (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>), and all others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a></div><div class="verse">And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle.</span> "The two wings of the great eagle" is found in most authorities, though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> omits both the articles. The symbol of the eagle is a common one in the Old Testament, and this may account for the presence of the article. The escape of the Jewish Church from the power of Pharaoh, and her preservation in the wilderness, are referred to under a like figure (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself"). The natural enmity between the eagle and the serpent is alluded to by Wordsworth (Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, where see a full exposition of the symbolism here employed). "The two wings" may typify the Old and New Testaments, by the authority of which the Church convicts her adversaries, and by which she is supported during her period of conflict with the devil. That she might fly into the wilderness, into her place. The reference to the flight of Israel from Egypt is still carried on. "Her place" is the "place prepared of God" (ver. 6). The Church, though in the world, is not of the world (see on ver. 6). Where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. Still the history of Israel is borne in mind. As the chosen people were nourished in the wilderness, so the Church of God is sustained in her pilgrimage on earth. The redundant <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "where there," follows the analogy of the Hebrew (see on ver. 6). "The time, times, and half a time," is the period elsewhere described as 42 months, 1260 days, 3.5 years. It denotes the period of the existence of this world (see on Revelation 11:2). The expression is taken from <a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>. By this verse and ver. 6 is established the identity of the two expressions - 1260 days, and the time, times, and half a time (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> one year + two years + half a year). The plural <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> is used for "two times," as no dual occurs in the Greek of the New Testament (see Winer, p. 221, Moulton's translation). The construction, "nourished from the face" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), is built upon the analogy of the Hebrew. The "serpent" is the "dragon" of ver. 13 (cf. ver. 9, "the great dragon, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan"). The two words are used as convertible terms (cf. ver. 17, where he is again called "the dragon"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-15.htm">Revelation 12:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the serpent cast out of his month water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood;</span> <span class="accented">cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river</span>...  <span class="accented">carried away by the river</span>. A <span class="accented">flood</span>, in the Old Testament, has several significations. It frequently expresses overwhelming misfortune. Thus <a href="../../par/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>, "Let not the waterflood overflow me;" <a href="../../par/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>, "Thou carriest them away as with a flood" (cf. also <a href="../../par/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-5.htm">Amos 9:5</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">flood</span> is typical of every form of destruction with which the devil seeks to overwhelm the Church of God. At the period of the writing of the Apocalypse, it plainly symbolized the bitter persecutions to which Christians were subjected; but its meaning need not be limited to this one form of destruction. Thus all those writers are correct, so far as they go, who interpret the <span class="accented">flood of</span> the Mohammedan power, of heresy, of the Gothic invasion, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-16.htm">Revelation 12:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth;</span> <span class="accented">swallowed up the river</span> (Revised Version). "The earth" frequently, but not invariably, in the Revelation signifies "the wicked." It is doubtful, therefore, how far the figure here employed should be pressed. What is certain is that the writer intends to express the idea that the Church is preserved in a wonderful and even miraculous way from the efforts of the devil. Further than this we cannot proceed safely. Possibly we may see in the passage an allusion to the world embracing Christianity, by which the instrument of Satan's ill will became a defence to the Church; though an earlier period and earlier deliverances seem more likely to be intended (such as the conversion of St. Paul); for after endeavouring to destroy the woman at one stroke, the dragon proceeds to war with her seed. The words recall another incident in the history of the Israelitish flight from Egypt and sojourn in the wilderness, viz. that of the destruction of Korah and his company; though, of course, the nature of the incidents is not the same in both cases. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed;</span> <span class="accented">waxed wroth</span>...  <span class="accented">went away to make</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Having failed to prevent the mission of' the man child - Christ Jesus - and having been foiled in his attempts to overwhelm the Church of God, Satan proceeds to attack the individual members of the Church - the seed of the woman. The method by which he endeavours to do this is related in the following chapters. Wordsworth points out an analogy between the means which Satan employs to destroy the Church as described here, and those described in the seals. The "rest of her seed" (Revised Version) signifies all the children of the woman, excluding the man child of ver. 5. All members of the Church of God are thus referred to, those who are brethren of Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>, "For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren"). <span class="cmt_word">Which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</span> (nearly all manuscripts omit "Christ"); <span class="accented">hold the testimony</span> (Revised Version). This plainly points out who are the "rest of the seed" - they are those who are God's faithful servants. We may see in the description a reference to the Church of God, both Jewish and Christian. The members of the Jewish Church were they to whom "the commandments of God" were specially revealed, and Christians are they who specially "hold the testimony of Jesus." (For an explanation of the latter phrase, see on Revelation 1:2.) We have now reached another stage in the history of the warfare carried on by the devil against God. Vers. 7-12 of this chapter describe the origin of the hostility of Satan towards God; vers. 4 and 5 relate the attempts of the devil to destroy Christ and to thwart his mission; vers. 13-16 refer to the attacks of Satan upon the Church of God, by which he hoped to destroy it as a whole, before there was time for the "seed" to spring up. Having failed in every attempt, the dragon now sends other agents by whom he hopes to destroy the individual members of the Church - the other seed of the woman - the brethren of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/13.htm"><title>Revelation 13 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/13.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/13.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/13-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/12.htm" title="Revelation 12">&#9668;</a> Revelation 13 <a href="../revelation/14.htm" title="Revelation 14">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a></div><div class="verse">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I stood upon the sand of the sea.</span> The Revised Version, agreeing with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C, Vulgate, Syriac, AEthiopic, Armenian, Victorinus, reads <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "he stood." The Authorized Version follows the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I stood," which is found in B, P, Coptic, Andreas, Arethas. Fortunately, the point is not important. Whether St. John or the dragon stood on the edge of the sea is not material, since we are distinctly told that the ten-horned beast rose from the sea. Wordsworth aptly contrasts this station on the unstable sand in proximity to the sea, the clement of commotion, with the vision of the Lamb on Mount Zion (<a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-5</a>). The imagery which follows is founded upon the vision of <a href="../../par/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. The phrase should probably be joined on to the preceding passage, as in the Revised Version. The new vision then opens in the customary manner with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "I saw," as in <a href="../../par/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4, 5, 6, 7</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And saw a beast rise up out of the sea</span>. Supply "I," and make this the beginning of the fresh paragraph (see above). The one beast here takes the place of the four beasts of <a href="../../par/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, and is distinguished by the characteristics of the first three (see on ver. 2). This beast arises from the <span class="accented">sea</span>, the second beast from the <span class="accented">earth</span> (see ver. 11). They are the instruments of the woe which is denounced against the <span class="accented">earth</span> and the <span class="accented">sea</span> in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>. The <span class="accented">sea</span>, again, is the type of instability, confusion, and commotion, frequently signifying the ungovernable nations of the earth in opposition to the Church of God (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). Probably this is the beast referred to in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, and (more fully) in <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. It is the power of the world which is directed towards the persecution of Christians. Having seven heads and ten horns. Nearly every manuscript has, <span class="accented">having ten horns and seven heads.</span> The order is reversed in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a> and Revelation 17:3; possibly the horns are mentioned first in this passage, because they are first seen as the beast rises from the sea. The essential identity of this beast with the dragon of <a href="../../par/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a> is plainly shown. There Satan is described in his personal character; here he is described under the aspect of the persecuting power of the world. The symbolism is analogous to that found in <a href="../../par/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, where we may find the key to the interpretation. First, the <span class="accented">heads</span> signify dominion. The head is naturally looked upon as the chief, the controlling and guiding part of the body; that part to which all the members of the body are subject. This is the idea conveyed in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a>. The third beast there is distinguished by the possession of four heads, and (we are immediately told) "dominion was given to it." <span class="accented">Seven</span>, as we have repeatedly seen, is the number typical of universality (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">seven, heads</span>, therefore, are symbolical of universal dominion. In the second place, <span class="accented">horns</span> are the type of power. Thus, in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, the beast which is distinguished by the possession of the horns is described as being "diverse from all the beasts that were before it." It was "dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it" (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>, etc.). The number <span class="accented">ten</span> is the sign of completeness; not of universality or totality, but of sufficiency and abundancy for the purpose in view (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>, the ten righteous wanting at Sodom; <a href="../../par/exodus/27-12.htm">Exodus 27:12</a>, the ten pillars of the tabernacle; the ten commandments; the tithe; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">ten horns</span>, therefore, denote plenitude of power. The words of this passage thus signify that the beast should possess worldwide dominion and ample power. These are the qualities ascribed to the power which Satan now directs against the "seed of the woman." At the time of the writing of the Apocalypse, this power was evidently heathen Rome; but the meaning may be extended to embrace all the forms which this world opposition has assumed, whether Roman, Mohammedan, or Gothic, etc. It is consequently unnecessary, as it certainly seems fruitless, to attempt to interpret the <span class="accented">heads</span> and <span class="accented">horns</span> of individual nations and kings. In endeavouring to do so, many writers have imported into the description here given other details from Daniel, or deduced by themselves, for which there is no warrant in the narrative here supplied. For the same reason, it is useless to inquire into the disposition of the <span class="accented">ten horns</span> and <span class="accented">seven heads</span>; since the whole is a figure intended to convey certain ideas, and is not a description of an actual bodily form. <span class="cmt_word">And upon his horns ten crowns.</span> "Ten crowns;" <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, crowns denoting sovereignty; not <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the victor's wreath. The <span class="accented">crowns</span> upon the <span class="accented">horns</span> denote the sovereign nature of the power with which the beast is invested. The nations of the world who have persecuted the Church of God have the chief rule in this world. <span class="cmt_word">And upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</span> The plural <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "names," adopted by the Revised Version, is found in A, B, Vulgate, Coptic, Andreas, Primasius. Alford reads the singular <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P, Coptic, Andreas, Primasius. There is no article. Possibly each head bore a name, which was the same in each case, and which might therefore with equal propriety be described as <span class="accented">name</span> or <span class="accented">names.</span> "Upon his heads" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>); the accusative being used (as Afford suggests) because the action of inscription carries with it a tinge of motion. In the preceding clause we have the genitive Or; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, where the preposition denotes rest. We have no hint given as to what the <span class="accented">name</span> was; the nature only is indicated. St. John very possibly had in his mind the mitre of the high priest, upon the plate of which was inscribed, "Holiness to the Lord" (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). It is a "name of blasphemy;" that is, the worldly power, typified by this beast, denies the Divinity and might of the true God, and exalts itself above him. Bede, Hengstenberg, etc., see the fulfilment in the assumption by the Roman emperors of titles which belong rightly only to Christ - King of kings, Divus, etc. But the application is wider. As partial fulfilments of that which will never be completely fulfilled until the end of the world, we may mention Pharaoh, when he said, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?" (<a href="../../par/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>); Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a>.); Herod Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>); as well as those since St. John's time who have blasphemed by denying the existence or omnipotence of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as <i>the feet</i> of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.</span> The similarity to the vision of <a href="../../par/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. is very evident; the resemblance extending even to the language, which is here very like the LXX. version of Daniel. Cf. especially the form <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (found in all the best manuscripts) with that of the LXX. of <a href="../../par/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>. In the vision of Daniel four beasts are seen rising from the sea. The first was like a <span class="accented">lion</span>, the second like a <span class="accented">bear</span>, the third like a <span class="accented">leopard</span>, the fourth was distinguished by the <span class="accented">ten horns.</span> Here the four are combined in the one appearance of the beast. The qualities which are indicated by the animals named are very generally agreed upon. The <span class="accented">lion</span> denotes lordly dominion and rule; the <span class="accented">bear</span> suggests crushing force and tenacity of purpose; the <span class="accented">leopard</span> is distinguished for its swiftness and cruel blood thirstiness. These characteristics marked the Roman empire at the time of this vision, and this probably was the first fulfilment of the vision. The same qualities have, however, been exhibited at all times by the persecutors of the Church of God, and thus the application may be extended, and the vision represents (as Alford says) "not the Roman empire merely, but the aggregate of the empires of this world as opposed to Christ and his kingdom." <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority;</span> <span class="accented">and his throne.</span> The dragon and this beast are essentially one, since the latter wields all the influence of the former. The devil lost his throne in heaven; through the power of the world he temporarily regains a throne as the "prince of this world." Christ, by his incarnation, destroyed much of the personal nature of the devil's influence over men. By that the devil was completely bound as regards the righteous (cf. the interpretation of <a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>); but his power to work mischief he transfers to the nations of the world, who become his instrument for that purpose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed;</span> <span class="accented">and one of his heads as though it had been slain unto death</span>; <span class="accented">and his death stroke was healed.</span> The writer wishes to express the coexistence of two mutually antagonistic qualities. The head had received a fatal wound, and yet the beast continued to exist and exert his power. There may be a contrast and a comparison intended between the Lamb, as it had been slain, worshipped by his adoring followers, and the beast, usurping the honour due to Christ, imitating him even in the respect of having been slain, and exacting homage from those who "wondered after the beast." But the "head smitten unto death" must still possess some special significance of its own. What that is we are not plainly told; but it seems reasonable to refer it to the blow dealt to the power of Satan by the death and resurrection of Christ. It almost seemed at first as though the power of the world must succumb to the influence of the life and death of our Lord, and for a time great progress was made in the increase of the number of believers (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41, 47</a>). But the power of the world was not yet destroyed; it continued to exist in spite of the seemingly fatal wound. Some see in this account a reference to the destruction of the Roman pagan empire, and the establishment of the Christian empire. Others believe the blow to be that administered by Michael, when Satan was ejected from heaven. Others refer the wounded head to different individuals; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Nero. That <span class="accented">one head</span> is wounded out of the seven probably denotes the partial nature of the wound as visible to an observer. <span class="cmt_word">And all the world wondered after the beast</span>; <span class="accented">the whole earth wondered after the beast.</span> The pregnant construction. That <span class="accented">earth</span>, for which the advent of the dragon meant <span class="accented">woe</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>), <span class="accented">wondered</span> at, and followed <span class="accented">after</span> the beast. The sense of <span class="accented">earth</span> must here be restricted to the followers of the world, as opposed to the followers of God.

The beast usurps the homage due to God alone (cf. the song of those who had triumphed in <a href="../../par/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>, "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name?" cf. also <a href="../../par/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>, etc.). The adherents of the beast thus intimate their belief in his superior prowess and his ability to succeed in his war against those who "keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty <i>and</i> two months.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies. So the horn which sprang from the fourth beast of <a href="../../par/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a> had given to it "a mouth speaking great things." The power of the beast is, after all, only held by the consent of God, who for his own good purpose permits him to exercise it for a time. The "great things" are the promises of superior power and good, with which the devil seeks to allure men, as he did Adam and Eve at the first. All attempts to decry God's omnipotence and the power of Christ are <span class="accented">blasphemies. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And power was given unto him to continue forty</span> <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">two months;</span> or, <span class="accented">to work forty and two months.</span> Again note the power is given to him; that is, he holds it only subject to the will of God. The "forty and two months," or three years and a half, signify the period of the world's existence. (For a full discussion of the subject, see on Revelation 11:2.) It is the "little time" of <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10, 11</a>, during which will be fulfilled the number of the saints. It is the "little season" of <a href="../../par/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, during which Satan is "loosed," that is, during which he has this power to work given to him (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). The different readings in this passage, though resting on insufficient authority, serve to amplify the meaning. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> reads <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "to do what he willeth." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "to wage war," is found in 13 and others, and is the marginal reading of the Authorized Version, but is rightly omitted in the Revised Version.

So in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>, "The same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High." And in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, "The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them [the two witnesses], and shall overcome them, and kill them." <span class="accented">Overcome</span>; that is, apparently; so far as is seen by the world. In the same way the world overcame Christ; but by his death came victory. So in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> the Church at Smyrna is encouraged by the words, "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer...  be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."

The fourfold enumeration, applied to the earth, denotes the universal character of the description (cf. the four living beings, <a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. Also <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-9.htm">Revelation 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>). The same classification is adopted in the song of the redeemed (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>), which may be contrasted with this passage. Although the power of Satan extends to every section of the nations of the earth, yet men are not irrevocably delivered into his hand. From every part of mankind men are also redeemed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a></div><div class="verse">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb</span>; [<span class="accented">every</span> one] <span class="accented">whose name hath not been written</span>, as in the Revised Version.

"Whose name," singular, referring to the individuals of whom the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "all," are composed. This verse states in another form what has been related in the latter part of the preceding verse. Those over whom the beast has authority are those who worship him, and whose names have not "been written in the book of life." The expression, "book of life," is found only in this book and <a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>. In all the places where it occurs it seems to refer primarily to Christians (cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-19.htm">Revelation 22:19</a>). At baptism the Christian's name is written in the "book of life," from which there is always a possibility of it being blotted out (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>). Those who are not Christians have not their name in the "book of life," but <span class="accented">worship</span> the beast, that is, pay allegiance to him. It is "the book of life of the Lamb," because it is through "the Lamb" that there exists a "book of life" for men. <span class="cmt_word">Slain from the foundation of the world;</span> or, <span class="accented">that hath been slain.</span> It is natural to connect the words, "from the foundation of the world," with "slain," and not with "written." The latter course has been followed by Bengel, Dusterdieck, De Wette, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and others, and in the margin of the Revised Version, and is in accordance with <a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>, "Whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world" (see also <a href="../../par/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). "The Lamb hath been slain from the foundation of the world," because from "the foundation of the world" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>) his death has been efficacious for the salvation of men; and because his death "was foreordained before the foundation of the world," although manifest only in the last times (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). What was foreknown to and ordained by God is spoken of as having taken place. This latter sense must be the meaning if we adopt the alternative reading.

Here is the patience and the faith of the saints</span>. There is a twofold difficulty in this verse: first, as to the correct text; secondly, as to the meaning. There are two chief readings. Codex: A has <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; literally, <span class="accented">if</span> <span class="accented">any one late captivity, into captivity he goeth</span>; which probably means, "If any one is ordained unto captivity, into captivity he goeth." The reading of the Textus Receptus looks like an attempt to amplify and make clear the above reading: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. XXX, B, C, have the reading of A, omitting the repetition of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. This omission is easily explained by homoeoteleuton, and accordingly the majority of critical editors follow Codex A. There are two passages in Jeremiah which are suggested by these words. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a> reads, "Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity;" <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>, "And deliver such as are for death, to death; and such as are for captivity, to captivity; and such as are for the sword, to the sword." <a href="../../par/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a> may also be referred to: "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." The verse in the text appears to contain both the meanings of the passages referred to. The first half seems to point out that there are woes foreordained for Christians which they must undergo: "He for whom captivity is appointed must be content to suffer captivity." The next part extends the meaning, adding a warning: "You Christians must suffer these things; not only not relinquishing your faith, but also not meeting three with force; remembering always your Master's saying, 'They that take the sword shall perish with the sword.'" Then the verse concludes, "Here is [the proof of] the patience and the faith of the saints." St. John has just described to his hearers the extensive nature of the power of the world (vers. 3, 7, 8); the obvious conclusion was that captivity, etc., was the lot appointed for some of them. He has also told them of the war waged by the world against Christians, and now he adds the necessary caution against any attempt to defend themselves by the use of the sword. And thus not only their patience but their faith was to be tested. They were not only to bear patiently evils which they could not avoid, but they must have sufficient faith to enable them voluntarily to forego any opportunities which might occur to prevent their sufferings by force of arms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a></div><div class="verse">And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld another beast.</span> Compare the wording of this introduction with that of ver. 1. We shall find reason to interpret this <span class="accented">beast</span> as self deceit - that form of plausibility by which men persuaded themselves into a belief that they might without harm worship the former beast. (see on following verses). It has been remarked that mention is often made of the first beast without the second (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>, etc.), but never of the second without the first. This fact supports the interpretation given above. <span class="cmt_word">Coming up out of the earth.</span> Perhaps in contrast with the former beast, which arose from the sea (ver. 1). In the vision of <a href="../../par/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. the four beasts, which rise from the sea (ver. 3), are declared in ver. 17 to typify four kings which arise from the earth. It is doubtful, therefore, whether we are justified in attaching special significance to this phrase. Some writers understand thereby, "rising up from amongst settled, ordered society of men." More likely, the writer wishes to show the universal character of the temptations with which Christians are assailed; and thus one beast seems to pertain to the sea, and the other to the earth, thus dividing the whole world between them. <span class="cmt_word">And he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</span> That is, while simulating an appearance of Christ, his words betrayed his devilish nature. The aim of this beast throughout is to assume a plausible exterior, that men may be beguiled by him (cf. vers. 13-17). Such is the nature of that self deceit which we believe this beast to typify. Many men, who were not to be tempted into a renunciation of Christ by the bitter persecution of the first beast, because coming in such a form they recognized easily its true nature, were nevertheless beguiled into such acts by specious reasoning and the deceit of their own hearts. Christians at all times are only too ready to be deceived by those who "by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple" (<a href="../../par/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). Whether as in ancient times it he merely to throw a few grains of incense upon the altar of some heathen deity, or as in modern times to conform to some common but unworthy requirement of society, men are apt to be led astray by arguments which look fair, but which as surely accomplish the devil's object as if it had been attained by direct persecution. (On the form of the word <span class="accented">"lamb,"</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, see on Revelation 5:6.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-12.htm">Revelation 13:12</a></div><div class="verse">And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him;</span> <span class="accented">all the authority.., in his sight</span> (Revised Version). That is, his influence over men, though less directly asserted, is equal to that of the first beast. And he exercises this influence "in his sight," that is, by his permission and contemporaneously with the exercise of power by the first beast. So Christians both of St. John's and of our own time seek to escape direct persecution by justifying to themselves their unworthy compliance with the unrighteous requirements of the world. <span class="cmt_word">And causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</span> Here we have an explanation of the two preceding clauses. Though like a lamb in appearance, his words denote his deadly nature, which is shown by causing men to worship the first beast; and thus he exercises the authority of the first beast, and accomplishes his work. Those who dwell in the earth are the worldly, not faithful Christians, but those "whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb" (see on ver. 8). This beast causes men to worship the first beast by persuading them into a compliance with his will, and making them pay homage to him. For this reason he is called in <a href="../../par/revelation/16-13.htm">Revelation 16:13</a> the "false prophet." (For "whose deadly wound was healed," see on ver. 3.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a></div><div class="verse">And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he doeth great wonders.</span> Men are apt to deceive themselves by attributing to other agencies the power to work wonders which belongs only to God himself. In St. John's time the arts of magic were used; in modern times the marvels of science often lead men to a disbelief in God. Archdeacon Lee, in his commentary, says, "We cannot doubt that there is also a reference to the wonderful power over nature which the spirit of man has attained to, and which has too often been abused to the deification of Nature and her laws, and to the disparagement of the Divine action which is ever present in creation." <span class="cmt_word">So that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men;</span> <span class="accented">that he should even make fire</span>, etc.. as in the Revised Version. We are not to understand this literally. It is given as a kind of sample of the power possessed by the beast, being a form of miracle which would be well known to St. John's readers (cf. Elijah on Carmel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>; Korah's company, <a href="../../par/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>, etc.; also the request of SS. James and John, <a href="../../par/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>). The descent of fire is also frequently a sign of God's approval (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>). The two witnesses possessed the power of sending forth fire (see <a href="../../par/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a>). In this respect, therefore - in the very nature of his signs - the beast still seems to counterfeit the power of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a></div><div class="verse">And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by <i>the means of</i> those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast,</span> he deceives by employing false signs, and he deceives by inducing men to believe that the worship of the first beast is allowable. Those "that dwell on the earth" are the worldly minded, as in ver. 12. "Which he had power to do" should rather be "which it was given him to do," as in the Revised Version. The power possessed by the beast does not originate with himself; he possesses it only subject to the will of God (cf. vers. 5 and 7). Thus the second beast - self deceit - beguiles men. They accept exhibitions of power external to God as evidences of an independence and self sufficiency which do not exist apart from God, forgetful of the fact that this power is derived from God: <span class="accented">it is given</span> by him. (For "in the sight of the beast," see on ver. 12.) <span class="cmt_word">Saying to them that dwell on the earth.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "saying," masculine, agrees with the neuter <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The writer uses the masculine, as in ver. 8, because of the personified nature of the beast. It is not fair to press the word (as some writers do) into the signification that a man must be intended. "Them that dwell on the earth" - the worldly minded (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live;</span> <span class="accented">who hath the stroke of a sword, and lived</span>, as in the Revised Version. The masculine as before (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). This beast suggested that men should set up an image of the first beast, not in order to pay greater honour to the first beast, but that an apparent alternative might be offered to men, so that those who hesitated to pay direct allegiance to the first beast might overcome their scruples and worship something which resembled him, while allowing them to, as it were, cheat their own consciences by persuading themselves that they were not worshipping the beast himself. These two classes of men are, of course, essentially one; they are, in reality, all followers of the beast; but still there is a difference in the manner in which they become worshippers of the beast. The distinction of the two classes seems to be kept in mind in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> and Revelation 20:4, where, however, all are included in the same condemnation. Thus the apostle teaches us that those who, by specious and plausible reasoning, who, in short, by self deceit, allow themselves to east in their lot with the worldly - the avowed followers of the first beast - are equally guilty with those who openly proclaim themselves followers of the world. (On the last part of the verse, the nature of the sword stroke, see on ver. 3.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-15.htm">Revelation 13:15</a></div><div class="verse">And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed;</span> <span class="accented">and it was given to him to give breath</span>, etc. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and a number of cursives lead the indicative future, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, that is," he [the beast] shall cause," etc. The symbolism is most probably derived from the heathen oracles. This beast is permitted <span class="accented">to give life</span>, to impart spirit to the <span class="accented">image</span>; that is, he gives it an appearance of reality which a mere image could not possess. This is the dangerous power of self deceit. If men would face the naked truth, stripped of plausible arguments and specious resemblances, they would see that there was no reality in the ideal which they place before their minds, and their worship of which is prompted by love of the world, and the denial of God's power. Together with the attempt to deceive men into worshipping the image, is offered the alternative of death, or, should we not say, apparent death? It is only self deceit which makes men imagine that the alternative to an acceptance of the sovereignty of Satan and the world; is death. No doubt many Christians in St. John's time were thus beguiled. They deceived themselves by imagining that they must either conform to the heathen practices required of them, or suffer death; those with clearer mental vision saw that the threatened death was in reality life.

Wordsworth translates, "give to themselves," and adds, "a remarkable sentence, intimating <span class="accented">compulsion</span> under the semblance of <span class="accented">choice."</span> But it does not seem fair to press the meaning so far. The third plural is often used in a perfectly general way in the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>, and Moulton's Winer, p. 655), and the Revised Version is probably correct in translating by the passive (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Certainly the other passages in the Apocalypse, where the <span class="accented">mark</span> is mentioned, seem to show that men have absolute freedom of choice (see especially <a href="../../par/revelation/14-9.htm">Revelation 14:9</a> and Revelation 20:4). Again the beast seeks to imitate God (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, "I will write upon him my new name;" <a href="../../par/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, "His name shall be in their foreheads;" <a href="../../par/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>). The idea is taken kern the Mosaic customs (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, "And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontiers between thine eyes") Some writers see also an allusion to the heathen custom of branding slaves and others who were devoted to the service of temples; and recall the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, or "cuttings," such as are here mentioned, were forbidden to the Jews (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-17.htm">Revelation 13:17</a></div><div class="verse">And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that no man might bay or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span> "And" is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, some cursives and versions and Fathers: <span class="accented">no</span> <span class="accented">man should be able to buy</span>, etc. A, B, C, P, and most cursives also omit <span class="greek">&#x1f24;</span>, "or," before "the name," thus reading, as in the Revised Version: <span class="accented">save</span> <span class="accented">he that hath the mark, even the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span> This expressly asserts what we might have gathered from the analogy of the mark of the true Christian (see on ver. 16), viz. that "the mark" was "the name" or "the number of his name." The manner in which this was fulfilled in the early ages of the Church is sufficiently notorious. Then faithfulness to the cause of Christ frequently meant banishment from friends, kindred, and home. St. John himself was feeling the effect of this at the time when he wrote these words in exile at Patmos. So, at the present day, the Jews regard as an utter alien any one of their number who embraces Christianity. So also, at the present day, the faithful Christian is often interdicted the society of the world, is declared a social nuisance, and is shunned by the worldly minded, who pay allegiance to the beast. (On the "number," see on ver. 18.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a></div><div class="verse">Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number <i>is</i> Six hundred threescore <i>and</i> six.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Here is wisdom, Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man.</span> The last clause has no article, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>. Compare the expression, "Here is the patience," etc. in ver. 10, where it relates to what precedes. Here it evidently refers to what follows. The form of expression is frequent in St. John's writings (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>, etc.). The plain meaning seems to be that men may display their wisdom and understanding in discovering the meaning of the number of the beast. But the interpretation which Auberlen gives may be correct; viz. that as the first beast is met and vanquished by patience and faith, so this second beast is to be met by <span class="accented">wisdom.</span> This agrees with our interpretation of this second beast as symbolizing self deceit. St. John evidently intends that the meaning of the number should be known: "Let him that hath understanding count the number;" that is, "Let him that hath understanding discern in what sense the symbol is used." It is the "number of man;" that is, it describes symbolically something which is peculiarly a characteristic of mankind. Some writers have understood the words to mean, "the number refers to an individual man;" but the absence of the article militates against this view. Others explain, "It is a number which is to be reckoned according to man's mode of reckoning," just as in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-17.htm">Revelation 21:17</a>, "a measure of a man." If this be the meaning, it leaves open the question as to what St. John meant by "the usual mode of man's reckoning." His own use of numerals throughout the Apocalypse is, as we have repeatedly seen, symbolical of general qualities, and does not indicate either individuals or exact numbers. We are justified, therefore, according to this view, in interpreting the number symbolically (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">.<span class="cmt_word"></span> And his number is Six hundred three score and six.</span> The Revised Version is better, <span class="accented">Six hundred and sixty and six</span>; it preserves the similarity of form which is found in the Greek words, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3be;</span>, as found in A. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc.; in P, Andreas, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. The shortened form <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3be;&#x3c2;</span>' is found in B and most cursives. C, 11, and some manuscripts known to Irenaeus and Tichonius differ by reading <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3be;</span>, "six hundred and sixteen," but this is probably incorrect. Commentators have universally attempted to discover the name denoted by this number, by attaching to each letter of the name (generally the Greek letters) its numerical value, the total of which should equal the number 666. To this method there are several objections. In the first place, St. John nowhere else makes such use of a number, though numbers form a prominent feature of the book. In the second place, the adoption of this method seems to have been a consequence upon the interpretation of the words, "number of a man," as meaning "a number to be calculated according to man's methods." But this may not be the meaning at all (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>); and, if it is, "man's method" would surely signify the symbolical method which St. John adopts all through the rest of the book, as being a language perfectly well understood by himself and his readers. And thirdly, this numerical method has proved entirely unsatisfactory in the hands of those who have hitherto adopted it. For a complete <span class="accented">expose</span> of the fallaciousness of such attempts, we may refer the reader to Dr. Salmon's 'Introduction to the New Testament,' p. 291, <span class="accented">et seq.</span> A commonly received interpretation makes the name of the beast to be Nero Caesar, written in the Hebrew characters <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5e1;&#x5e8;</span>; and as the name may be written <span class="accented">Neron</span> or <span class="accented">Nero</span>, the difference of the final <span class="accented">n</span> (  =   50) is thought to account for the discrepancy in the manuscript authorities. Dr. Salmon shows that Nero could not have been intended, because (1)the prophecy in that ease would have been immediately falsified; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the solution would have been known to the early Christians; but it was <span class="accented">not</span> known, according to Irenaeus. Dr. Salmon then adds (p. 300), "Pages might be filled with a list of persons whose names have been proposed as solutions of the problem. Among the persons supposed to be indicated are the emperors Caligula, Trajan, and Julian the Apostate, Genseric the Vandal, Popes Benedict IX. and Paul V., Mahomet, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Beza, and Napoleon Bonaparte. There are three rules by the help of which I believe an ingenious man could find the required sum in any given name. First, if the proper name by itself will not yield it, add a title; secondly, if the sum cannot be found in Greek, try Hebrew, or even Latin; thirdly, do not be too particular about the spelling." The above objections also hold good very generally with regard to the suggestion of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by which may be indicated the Roman or Latin power, either pagan or papal. But if we attempt to interpret this number in the same way as we have dealt with all other numbers in the Apocalypse, viz. by regarding them as symbolical of qualities, we shall be on surer ground. In the first place, the number <span class="accented">six</span> is typical of what is earthly as opposed to what is heavenly. As seven is the number of perfection, and is descriptive of universality, and is therefore the symbol pertaining to God, so six is a type of what falls short of the heavenly ideal. Cf. the <span class="accented">six</span> days of the creation; the <span class="accented">six</span> years of servitude (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>, etc.) and of work (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10</a>). Again, the threefold employment of the number <span class="accented">six</span>, while emphasizing the fact of the number referring to what is essentially earthly, has a fulness, importance, and seeming completeness which makes it a type of that which appears to be perfect, but in reality falls short of perfection. It is, in short, symbolical of a deceit, a sham. It is therefore descriptive of the nature of the second beast; of that self deceit which causes men to accept the world as a substitute for God, or, at least, as not antagonistic to him; which enables men to thus quiet their consciences, while in reality becoming followers of the worldly power and subjects of Satan. That this is the meaning of the number <span class="accented">six</span> is recognized by some writers, though they do not here so apply it. In the 'Speaker's Commentary,' Introduction, &sect; 11 (<span class="accented">a</span>), we find, "Six is the 'signature' of non-perfection;" and, "This number is also a symbol of <span class="accented">human rule and power."</span> Wordsworth says, "The numerical symbol of the beast, 666, indicates that he aims at and aspires to the attributes of Christ, and puts forth a semblance of Christian truth, but falls away from it in a triple decline and degeneracy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/14.htm"><title>Revelation 14 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/14.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/14.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/14-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/13.htm" title="Revelation 13">&#9668;</a> Revelation 14 <a href="../revelation/15.htm" title="Revelation 15">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a></div><div class="verse">And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty <i>and</i> four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I looked</span>; <span class="accented">and I saw</span>, indicating a fresh phase of the vision (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, etc.).

Note the similarity to the description in <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. Here, as there, the hundred and forty-four thousand are those "redeemed from the earth" (ver. 3). The number denotes a large and perfect number; a multitude of which the total is complete (see on Revelation 7:4). In <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. the sealing in the forehead is described. This sign marks out the redeemed in contradistinction to those who have received the mark of the beast (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>).

The greatness of the voice is evidence of the vastness of the number. "Heaven," from which the sounds come, includes the "Mount Zion" of ver. 1, on which the Lamb and his followers stand. <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.</span> The Revised Version is better, <span class="accented">and the voice which I heard</span> [<span class="accented">was</span>] <span class="accented">as</span> [<span class="accented">the voice</span>] <span class="accented">of harpers harping with their harps.</span> This reading is supported by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, and other good authorities. <span class="accented">As the voice</span>; that is, in regard to its pleasantness; reminding the hearer of the temple worship.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a></div><div class="verse">These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.

In the Old Testament the employment of the figure of adultery and fornication to denote spiritual unfaithfulness is common (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>, etc.). St. John elsewhere in the Apocalypse makes use of the same symbolism (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>," That woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols;" also <a href="../../par/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5, 6</a>). Similarly, also, St. John pictures the faithful Church as the bride adorned for her Husband the Lamb (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). So also St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), "I espoused you as a chaste virgin to one Husband, Christ." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "virgins," is a word equally applicable to men or women. This verse, therefore, seems to describe those who are free from spiritual impurity and unfaithfulness; those who have not worshipped the beast and his image. Alford, however, thinks the words should be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</span> These words describe the great source of the bliss of the redeemed, viz. that they are continually in the presence of Christ. This is their reward for following him on earth; but the words must not be taken as referring to the earthly course of the saints (as Bengel, De Wette, Hengstenberg, and others). <span class="cmt_word">These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">these were purchased from among men, the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</span> Some have erroneously concluded that a reference is made to a portion of the redeemed to whom special honour is conceded; or to some who attain to glory before the rest. <span class="accented">The firstfruits</span> were the best of their kind (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>), selected from the rest, and consecrated to the service of God. So the redeemed are the best of their kind; they who have proved themselves faithful to God, who voluntarily separated themselves from the world, and consecrated themselves to the service of God while in the world, and who are thus afterwards separated by him and consecrated to his service forever.

They had not suffered themselves by self deceit (the second beast) to be beguiled into worship of the first beast - the world. Alford very appropriately refers to <a href="../../par/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1, 2</a>, "Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart." <span class="cmt_word">For they are without fault before the throne of God;</span> <span class="accented">they are without blemish.</span> The following phrase is omitted by nearly every authority. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "without blemish," reminds us of the "Lamb without blemish" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). Thus again they receive appropriate reward. While on earth they kept themselves undefiled; now they are, like the Lamb, free from blemish (see on ver. 4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven.</span> "Another" is omitted in some manuscripts, but should probably be inserted. "In mid heaven," as in <a href="../../par/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a>, etc. Having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people; <span class="accented">having an eternal gospel</span>...  <span class="accented">every nation and tribe and tongue and people.</span> 'Probably (though not certainly) "the gospel" in the ordinary sense, which is the signification of the expression throughout the New Testament, though the word is not found elsewhere in St. John's writings. The idea of this and the following verses is to portray the certainty of coming judgment. As a preliminary to this, the gospel is proclaimed to the whole world, in accordance with our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>. The <span class="accented">gospel</span> is <span class="accented">eternal</span> in its unalterable nature (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>), and in contrast to the power of the beast, which is set for destruction (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>). The fourfold enumeration shows the universal nature of the proclamation of the gospel (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, etc.) in reference to the world. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying with a loud voice.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "saying," in nominative, though agreeing with the accusative <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>," angel." The "great voice" is characteristic of all the heavenly utterances (ver. 2; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-12.htm">Revelation 11:12, 15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Fear God, and give glory to him.</span> Thus the angel proclaims the gospel in opposition to the second beast, who bids those that dwell on the earth to make an image to the first beast (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>). Compare the effect of the coming judgment, described in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For the hour of his judgment is come</span>. This is the reason given for the <span class="accented">fear</span> mentioned. That it has effect is seen by <a href="../../par/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>. <span class="accented">Is come</span>; that is to say, is at hand. <span class="cmt_word">And worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</span> As remarked above, the angel thus directly opposes the invitation of the second beast to pay homage to the first beast. Again we have the fourfold enumeration of objects of creation, denoting the universal nature of the assertion (cf. on ver. 6). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there followed another angel, saying;</span> <span class="accented">and another, a second angel, followed.</span> That is, of course, the second of the three who here make their appearance in close connection. Each new scene is unfolded by its own special messenger. Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; <span class="accented">fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which made</span>, etc. The second "is fallen" is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, etc., but is inserted in A, P, some cursives, versions, and Fathers. Omit "city." <span class="accented">Babylon</span> is the type of the world power. Like so much of the Apocalypse, the image is supplied by the Book of Daniel. There the kingdom is spoken of as <span class="accented">great</span> (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>.). In its oppression of the Jewish nation, Babylon is a type of the world power which persecutes the Church of God. At the time when St. John wrote, this power was preeminently possessed and wielded by Rome, and that empire may thus be intended as the immediate antitype of Babylon. But the description is also applicable to the persecuting power of the world in all ages, and its denial of and opposition to God. Babylon is representative of the world, as Jerusalem is of the true Church of God. Alford observes, "Two things are mingled: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wine of her fornication, of which all nations have drunk (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wine of the wrath of God, which he shall give her to drink (ver. 10 and <a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>). The latter is the retribution for the former; the former turns into the latter; they are treated as one and the same." The description seems taken from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7, 8</a>, "Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed." Again is the figure of <span class="accented">fornication</span> used to depict idolatry and general unfaithfulness towards God (see on ver. 4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-9.htm">Revelation 14:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive <i>his</i> mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice;</span> <span class="accented">and another, a third angel, etc.</span> (see on ver. 8). (On "loud voice," see on ver. 7.) <span class="cmt_word">If any man worship the beast and his image.</span> Here those who worship the beast and those who worship his image are regarded as one class, which they practically are (but see on Revelation 13:14). This is <span class="accented">the fornication</span> referred to in ver. 8, the retribution for which follows in ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">And receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand;</span> <span class="accented">a mark</span>; but doubtless the mark of the beast alluded to in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a> (which see). <span class="accented">In his forehead</span>, etc. (see on Revelation 13:16). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;</span> <span class="accented">he also</span>...  <span class="accented">which is mingled unmixed</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> undiluted) in <span class="accented">the cup of his anger</span> (Revised Version). The warning is given to men while there is yet time; the fall of Babylon, which is prophetically spoken of as having taken place (ver. 8), being yet in the future; that is to say, at the end of the world. The language in which the retribution is couched corresponds to that in which the sin is described (see on ver. 8). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, which originally signified "to mix," gradually came to signify "to pour," from the ancient custom of mixing spices, etc., as well as water, with the wine. The Authorized Version "poured out," therefore, is a correct translation. The <span class="accented">pouring</span> is in this case not accompanied by dilution with water; that is, God's wrath will not be tempered, but the wicked will feel the full force of his anger. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> The figure which is here used to portray the punishment of the wicked is common in the Bible. <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9, 10</a>, cf. with <a href="../../par/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>, may supply the origin of the simile. The punishment is in <span class="accented">the presence</span> of the angels and of the Lamb; that is, probably, the purity and bliss of heaven is visible to the wicked, and the sight of it, combined with the knowledge of its in- accessibility to themselves, is part of their torment (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23</a>). It is part of the wrath of God described in the first part of the verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-11.htm">Revelation 14:11</a></div><div class="verse">And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever.</span> Compare the wording of the passages quoted above on ver. 10, especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9, 10</a>, "The smoke thereof shall go up forever." This statement of the eternity of punishment is also in agreement with <a href="../../par/luke/16-26.htm">Luke 16:26</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/9-44.htm">Mark 9:44</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</span> "No rest," in contrast with the blessed rest of the saints (ver. 13). Wordsworth says, "<span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is a stronger expression than 'those who worship the beast;' it means those whose distinguishing characteristic is that they <span class="accented">are worshipping</span> the beast, and persist in worshipping him, even to the end. This characteristic is so strongly marked that they are here represented as keeping it even after their death." (On the "mark," see on Revelation 13:16-18.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">Here is the patience of the saints: here <i>are</i> they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus;</span> <span class="accented">here is the patience of the saints, they that keep</span>, etc. The patience of the saints is exhibited in believing in, and waiting for, the due retribution which will overtake the wicked at the last, and in maintaining the conflict against the dragon who goes to war with those "who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus" (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>), the testimony which is the outcome of <span class="accented">faith</span> (see also on Revelation 13:10).

We have just had mentioned the necessity for patience on the part of the saints; here we have an encouragement and incentive to that patience, inasmuch as they who die in the Lord are henceforward blessed. In what their blessedness consists, the next sentence slates. The full consummation of their bliss may not occur until after the judgment, but the faithful have not to wait until then for peace; their conflict is, after all, only for this life, and thus they may well be content to suffer for so short a period (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them;</span> <span class="accented">that they shall rest</span>...  <span class="accented">for their works</span>, etc. The first part explains the "blessedness" of the previous passage; in this <span class="accented">rest</span> consists their blessedness. The last clause, "for their works," etc., explains why the blessedness consists in rest; they have henceforth no need of labours, for the effects of their former works accompany them and permit them now complete rest. Contrast the opposite fate of the wicked, described in ver. 11. St. Paul urges upon Christians the same duty, and proffers the same encouragement: "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).

The angel acts as the messenger of the will of God to Christ in his capacity of Son of man, because the command is one concerning the times and seasons which the Father hath kept in his own power (Alford).

This agrees with the general tenor of the whole chapter, viz, a portrayal of the opposite fates in store for the faithful and the wicked. The description thus corresponds with the account of the end of the world given in <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>, with which chapter this one has so much in common (see on the first verses of the present chapter). In <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. the saints are first selected and sealed, before the wicked meet their doom. Thus, also, the judgment is described by our Lord in his parables of the wheat and the tares, and the sheep and the goats. This accounts also for the first gathering being presided over by the Son of man, while the second is conducted by an angel. The punishment in connection with the vintage seems to distinguish it from the first harvest. This also corresponds to the announcements of the former angels, who first preach the everlasting gospel, and afterwards denounce those who serve the beast (vers. 6-11).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast <i>it</i> into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth.</span> This angel is described in quite a different manner from "him who sat on the cloud" (ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">And cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God;</span> <span class="accented">into the wine press, the great</span> [winepress], etc. The feminine substantive has agreeing with it a masculine adjective. It is doubtful whether we ought to see in this anything more than a mere slip of grammar. Possibly the word is of either gender. It is connected with the festival of Bacchus. Wordsworth, however, accounts for the masculine form of the adjective by supposing that the writer wishes to give a stronger force to the word, and to emphasize the terrible nature of the wrath of God. We have the same image in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, and it seems derived from <a href="../../par/isaiah/58.htm">Isaiah 58</a>, and <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>. Destruction by an enemy is alluded to as the gathering of grapes in <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>. The text itself explains the signification of the figure. There seems also some reference in the language to those who "drink of the wine of the wrath of her [Babylon's] fornication" (ver. 8).

The description, of course, implies the terrific nature of the punishment - probably nothing more. In the same way the distance mentioned is no doubt intended to denote the extensive nature of the punishment, though why that particular number is chosen is not absolutely clear. Possibly it is derived from the square of 4 multiplied by the square of 10; four being significant of the created world (see on Revelation 4:6), and ten being the sign of completeness (see on Revelation 13:1); the number thus portraying completeness as regards the created world, and the inability of any one to escape God's judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/15.htm"><title>Revelation 15 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/15.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/15.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/15-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/14.htm" title="Revelation 14">&#9668;</a> Revelation 15 <a href="../revelation/16.htm" title="Revelation 16">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw another sign in heaven.</span> The last time we had this expression was in <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, where the history of the war between Satan and the Church was begun. Once more we have a new departure, the seer again, as it were, returning to the beginning? in order to trace the course of the punishments inflicted on men for their worship of the devil. <a href="../../par/revelation/15.htm">Revelation 15</a>. gives a short summary of this, which is expanded in <a href="../../par/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>; and it is introduced, as usual, by a vision of the saints in glory, in order to comfort and support the Christian in his warfare (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-5, 13</a>).

In reality, he sees the actions of the "seven angels" in succession. The number <span class="accented">seven</span> denotes the universal, all-extending nature of the plagues (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). They are the <span class="accented">last</span> plagues, because they lead on to the description of the final fall of the power of the devil in its various forms, and to the account of the last judgment of God and the eternal bliss of the saints in glory.

The title "King of the ages," or "eternal King," is applied to God in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>, and in the Book of Tobit twice (13:6 and 10), but seems unknown to the Old Testament.

It is a word which is applied more particularly to human acts. Perhaps it is used here in connection with the manifest justice of God's acts before all nations; cf. the song of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>), "Who is like thee, glorious in holiness," etc.?

For the idea of "clothed in precious stone," the LXX. reading of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a> is usually quoted.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and <i>upon</i> them which worshipped his image.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;</span> <span class="accented">his bowl into</span>, etc. (Revised Version). (On "vial," see on Revelation 5:8.) The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, "into," distinguishes the first three vials from the last four, which have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon," and some writers make this the basis for classifying the vials into groups of three and four; but it seems better to divide into groups of four and three (see on ver. 1, and preliminary remarks on the trumpet visions). And there fell; <span class="accented">and it became</span> (Revised Version). Compare the phraseology of <a href="../../par/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>. A noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. The counterpart of the sixth plague of Egypt. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "sore," used here, is the same used in LXX., <a href="../../par/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>. It is impossible to say with certainty what (if any) particular judgment upon the ungodly is intended to be signified by St. John in this plague. From amongst the numerous interpretations which have been given to illustrate this passage, we may mention that of Andreas, who sees in it a reference to the "ulcer" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of conscience. Or it may be that the writer has in contemplation that bodily disease which is the inevitable outcome of sin, and which often afflicts men in this world as the direct result of their misdoings; though, of course, it cannot always be asserted to be a consequence of a man's own personal misdoings. (On the latter part of the verse, see on Revelation 13.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead <i>man</i>: and every living soul died in the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea.</span> Omit "angel," which is not found in the best manuscripts, though it is understood.

The <span class="accented">sea</span> is also the object of the second trumpet plague (see on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">And it became as the blood of a dead man;</span> <span class="accented">became blood as of a dead man.</span> Almost an exact reproduction of the second trumpet, and of the first of the Egyptian plagues. The last clause intensifies the horrible nature of the judgment, and thus in some degree increases the severity of this plague over that of the trumpets. <span class="cmt_word">And every living soul died in the sea;</span> <span class="accented">and every soul of life died</span>, [<span class="accented">even</span>] <span class="accented">the things in the sea</span>, though <span class="accented">living soul</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, some cursives, versions, and Fathers. Not merely human lives. The <span class="accented">things</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>, is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, and others. In <a href="../../par/revelation/8-9.htm">Revelation 8:9</a> we have, "Even the creatures that were in the sea." The interpretations are as numerous as in the case of the second trumpet (see on Revelation 8:9). It is most probable that the sea is here mentioned as part of creation (another part of which is mentioned in the following verse), the whole of which suffers for the sin of man, and the whole of which, intended for his benefit, becomes a source of affliction and woe to him through sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-4.htm">Revelation 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood</span>. Omit "angel" (see on ver. 3). "Into the rivers," etc., as in the previous cases. The singular <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, probably on account of the neuter <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fde;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> being understood. The idea of the second vial is carried on here (cf. on ver. 3). Note the corresponding judgment of the third trumpet. In addition to the interpretation of the second vial given above, it is probable that the blood signifies the slaughter and death which is part of God's vengeance on the wicked (cf. ver. 6). The divisions adopted in the first four vials correspond to those in <a href="../../par/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>, which designate the whole of God's created world, "heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the angel of the waters say.</span> The angels, throughout this book, are represented as having individual offices to fulfil. Here we have a reference to the angel whose duty it is to control the rivers, just as, in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>, another angel is represented as having authority over fire. This verse and the following one are anticipations of <a href="../../par/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>, which is a commentary on <a href="../../par/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which latter is an elaboration of the judgments here described. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus;</span> <span class="accented">righteous art thou, which art and which wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge</span> (Revised Version). There is scarcely any authority for inserting "O Lord," or "and shalt be" (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>). The angel, as having authority over the waters, and, as it were, a commission to see that they do their duty for men, acknowledges the justice of the sentence which makes them into an instrument for, and type of, man's destruction. Though there is no authority for inserting "and shalt be," the idea is, no doubt, to express the eternal nature of God. The same expression occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a> (Revised Version) in almost exactly parallel connection; so also in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17, 18</a>. <span class="accented">Thou hast judged thus</span> refers to the judgment of the third vial, possibly to all the first three, Note the marginal reading of the Revised Version (supported by Alford), which disconnects this verse from the succeeding one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</span> This supplies the key to the interpretation of the previous visions. The ungodly have shed the blood of saints, therefore God deals out death to them. This is the meaning signified by the "blood" of the previous verses (cf. the doom of Babylon, described in <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, especially ver. 6; and <a href="../../par/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6, 24</a>. Cf. the words, "they are worthy," with <a href="../../par/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). It is correct to consider that this prophecy received its first fulfilment in the violent deaths of so many of those who were the earliest Christian persecutors. On this subject see Lactantius, 'De Morte Persecutorum.' 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-7.htm">Revelation 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <i>are</i> thy judgments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And! heard another out of the altar say.</span> Omit "another out of." The <span class="accented">altar</span> is connected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with the martyred saints (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with the judgments that fall on the earth in vengeance for the blood of the saints (<a href="../../par/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>); hence the appropriateness of this voice from the altar, which acquiesces in the judgments inflicted. The altar is here personified, and speaks concurring in the justice of those judgments sent on account of the saints who are represented by it. Some writers, however, understand "the angel of the altar," which is similar to the reading of the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments;</span> <span class="accented">Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty</span> (Revised Version). Reaffirming what has been declared by the angel of the waters (ver. 5), and expressing concurrence therein. (On "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>), see on Revelation 3:17.) Compare the expression in ver. 5. There God is declared <span class="accented">righteous</span> because he has thus judged; here the judgments are <span class="accented">righteous</span> because they. are his. Both phrases are equally true, giving the same truth from different standpoints. The same verdict is endorsed by the heavenly multitude in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>, when they celebrate the downfall of Babylon; another proof of the identity of the world which is here the object of the vial judgments and the Babylon, which is afterwards described, and whose doom is pronounced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-8.htm">Revelation 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "angel," is omitted in nearly all manuscripts, though, of course, it is understood. For the first time we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. "into" (see on ver. 2). Another part of creation is visited, thus completing the visitation of the fourfold division of the universe - the earth, the sea, the rivers, the heavens - as foretold in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And power was given unto him to scorch men with fire</span>. "And it was given to it" is more probable than "to him;" the angels do not directly punish, but indirectly by pouring out the vials. This form of words expresses the permissory nature of the evil which is wrought; nothing can be done but by the will of God (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5, 7, 14</a>). Bengel, Hengstenberg, and others consider that the permission to scorch men is given to the angel. <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">men</span> (with the article); perhaps referring to those mentioned in ver. 2. who had the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image, and who are the object of all the vial plagues. Though differing in form from the fourth trumpet, where the sun was darkened, yet the judgment is similar, though here of a more intense nature. In both cases, those objects which are given to men for their good are converted into instruments of punishment. We may, perhaps, see here an allusion to the heat of men's passions and vices, by which physically as well as morally they are destroyed; and which are also an emblem of the pains of hell as pictured in <a href="../../par/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>. It has been noticed as a coincidence that the objects of creation which are the subjects of the judgments of the fourth trumpet and fourth vial, were created on the fourth day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the Name of God.</span> <span class="accented">The men</span> (see on ver. 8). (On the meaning of the first clause, see on ver. 8.) This is the first mention in the vials of men blaspheming. As with Pharaoh and the Egyptians, the judgments of God, instead of awakening them to repentance, only serve to harden their hearts. This again occurs under the fifth and seventh vials. So also in the sixth trumpet, we are told, men repented not - a statement also made in the subsequent part of this verse. As before pointed out (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>), the two things are identical; non repentance, continuance in the service of the dragon, is blasphemy against God; though we generally reserve the name "blasphemy" for the open avowal of infidelity to God. <span class="cmt_word">Which hath power over these plagues.</span> This is what is implied in the words of ver. 8, "it was given to it?' In this visitation men distinctly recognize the hand of God. <span class="cmt_word">And they repented not to give him glory.</span> <span class="accented">Vide supra</span>, on the "blasphemy;" and contrast with <a href="../../par/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>  - another example of the sense in which these vials are the "last plagues" (<a href="../../par/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast.</span> Omit "angel" as before (see on ver. 8). <span class="accented">The throne of the beast.</span> That throne which had been given to him by the dragon (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>), and which here typifies the centre and source of his power. While this <span class="accented">throne</span> may aptly refer to the Roman empire in St. John's time, its position varies at different times; wherever the world power is worshipped, there the beast has his throne. <span class="cmt_word">And his kingdom was full of darkness;</span> <span class="accented">was darkened.</span> Another allusion to the plagues of Egypt. The darkness is a type of the spiritual darkness which prevails among the subjects of the beast, and which they themselves frequently realize in the course of their career. The fear of the future sometimes arouses their misgivings, and then there is no light or hope in their hearts. And they gnawed their tongues for rain. The pain arising from the darkness of their minds; the misgivings as to their future (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>); or perhaps also on account of their sufferings under the former plagues, to which this is an addition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores.</span> The expression, "God of heaven," seems to enhance the exaltation of God, and to place in more terrible contrast the sin of those who ventured to blaspheme One so high, so far above them. This title is only mentioned here and in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>, where, however, some repented. (On the word "blaspheme," see on ver. 9.) In spite, therefore, of their plagues, and perhaps as a consequence of their spiritual darkness, they still own the supremacy of the beast and deny God; just as Pharaoh hardened his heart. Compare the previous verses for an account of their <span class="accented">pains and their sores</span>; the allusion to which shows plainly that these plagues are not necessarily consecutive in time. <span class="cmt_word">And repented not of their deeds</span> (see on ver. 9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river:Euphrates.</span> Omit "angel" (see on previous verses). (On the <span class="accented">Euphrates</span>, see on Revelation 9:14.) This river also figures in the sixth trumpet vision, and possesses the same signification in both places. It is the natural direction from which enemies arise; and it derives this signification from the fact that the enemies of the Jews often came from that direction. The next sentence leaves no doubt that this is the meaning, and supports the view taken of <a href="../../par/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>. It is to be noticed that, though the vial is poured out upon the Euphrates, it is not with the purpose of inflicting injury on the river, but upon the men who are thus laid open to the attacks of their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">And the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</span> The Revised Version gives the sense more plainly, <span class="accented">That the way might be made ready for the kings that</span> [<span class="accented">come</span>] <span class="accented">from the sunrising.</span> The meaning is that a barrier that wards off hostile hosts is removed. The "kings of the cast" represent God's judgments; those who are laid open to attack are the adherents of the beast. The imagery may be derived: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> From the fact (as explained in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>, which see) that the enemies of the Jews generally came from beyond the Euphrates. This accounts for the employment of this figure in <a href="../../par/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9</a>, and may reasonably be considered to contain the same allusion here. In this case the minor details do not agree; the idea is merely to convey the central fact of an advance of enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> From the historical fact of the taking of Babylon by Cyrus, by means of a diversion of the waters of the Euphrates - a circumstance referred to in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31, 32</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27, 28</a>. In this case the details are more in accordance with the general symbolism of the Apocalypse. Babylon would signify the kingdom of the beast (as in ver. 19). The <span class="accented">kings of the east</span> would still represent God's judgments, which now assail the kingdom of Satan. Satan attempts to meet this assault by the three spirits, which gather kings from the whole world (ver. 14) to battle against the Almighty. The "kings of the east" are certainly the forces ranged on the side of God. Many writers see an allusion to Christ and the saints. The sun is a frequent figure of Christ in Scripture (cf. <a href="../../par/malachi/4-4.htm">Malachi 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a> and Zechariah 6:12, LXX.; <a href="../../par/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>; also <a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>). "The kings of the east" may thus be identified with the armies of <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.

The mention of the punishment of the ungodly by the kings of the east causes the seer to look forward to the conflict, the end of which is described in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>. He therefore now digresses somewhat, in order to describe the means by which the dragon endeavours to enlist the hosts of the world on his side. <span class="cmt_word">Three unclean spirits like frogs.</span> These <span class="accented">three spirits</span> represent the influences of the dragon, the first beast and the second beast, which we have interpreted as the devil, the love of the world and worldly power, and self deceit; in other words, the devil, the world, the flesh. These influences axe spiritually <span class="accented">unclean</span>, and suggest the loathsome Egyptian plague of the <span class="accented">frogs</span>; that is to say, their likeness to frogs consists in their common quality of uncleanness. Perhaps also there is a reference to their devilish origin, in which they resembled the <span class="accented">unclean</span> spirits so frequently east out by our Lord while on earth. Burger very aptly refers to the contrast afforded by the dove-like form of the Holy Spirit of God. <span class="cmt_word">Come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</span> Omit "come." The seer does not behold the three spirits proceeding from the mouths of the evil trinity, but he sees those that are out of their mouths; he sees them in their works exhibited in the world. The second beast is here called the "false prophet," since he deludes men, and persuades them against their better judgment to worship the first beast (see on Revelation 13:11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a></div><div class="verse">For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <i>which</i> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles.</span> This explains the account given in ver. 13. In the plague of the frogs, the Egyptian magicians imitated the plague of Moses; the second beast (the false prophet) is represented as leading men astray by his miracles (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a>). After the sixth trumpet came the digression, in which an account was given of the two witnesses of God, who worked miracles (<a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>.); here, after the sixth vial, we have a short digression, in which an account is given of the three witnesses of Satan, who endeavour rework on his behalf, by exhibiting miracles. (For the meaning of this working of miracles, see on Revelation 13:13.) <span class="cmt_word">Which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world;</span> <span class="accented">the kings of the whole world -</span> omitting "of the earth" (Revised Version). <span class="accented">The kings of the world</span> are those whose aim and delight is the possession of the pleasures of this world; those who have their treasure in this world, and whose hearts are therefore also there; those who exercise their influence and power in regard only to the things of this world; in short, the worldly. <span class="cmt_word">To gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty;</span> <span class="accented">God, the Almighty.</span> This battle is described in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, which see. <span class="accented">The great day</span> is the last great judgment day. The battle referred to here, and described in <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>, and again in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1-10</a>, is apparently the battle which is being waged against God by the forces of evil all through the history of the world, from the fall of Adam until the last judgment day. This seems certain from the description given in <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. and 20. How, then, can it be described as the "battle of the great day"? Probably because on that day will occur the crisis, as it were, of the conflict; on that day will the issue be plainly determined, and the struggle terminated. Though the battle is proceeding daily, there is little to remind us of it; the very existence of, and necessity for, such warfare is sometimes forgotten in the daily round of life: at the last day will be plainly exhibited the nature of the incessant hostility between God and the devil, and the power of the latter will be manifested only to be visibly shattered and finally destroyed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <i>is</i> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I come as a thief.</span> The very words addressed to the Church at Sardis (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>), and similar to those connected by our blessed Lord with the great day (see ver. 14). The mention of that day, and perhaps the knowledge that the battle is a daily one (see on ver. 14), naturally leads to the solemn warning given here. It is worth notice how St. John adopts this idea; and this of itself should suffice to demonstrate the incorrectness of endeavoring to compute the times and seasons, as has been done by so many Apocalyptic writers (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</span> The same figure again as in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>. Isaac Williams correctly points out that these words seem to indicate that the battle of ver. 14 is a daily one, in which Christians are themselves engaged (see on ver. 14). The garment is the garment of righteousness, the fervent love of God (see on Revelation 3:17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a></div><div class="verse">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon;</span> or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they gathered</span>; that is, the "spirits" of ver. 14, of which this is a continuation, the same verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> being repeated. By the employment of the Hebrew term, attention is called to the symbolical nature of the name. Similar cases occur in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a> and elsewhere in St. John's writings (see on Revelation 9:11). The correct reading, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">Har-Magedon</span>, signifies "Mountain of Megiddo;" the Authorized Version, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">Armageddon</span>, "City of Megiddo." <span class="accented">Mount Megiddo</span> possibly refers to Carmel, at the foot of which lay the Plain of Megiddo, which was well known to every Jew as a gathering place for hostile hosts and as the scene of many battles. It is referred to in <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a> as a type of woe, on account of the overthrow and death of Josiah having taken place there (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). Ahaziah also died there (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>); and there also the Canaanitish kings were overthrown (<a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>). The name is, therefore, indicative of battle and slaughter, and intimates the complete overthrow in store for the dragon and the kings of the earth, which is described later on (<a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air.</span> Omit "angel" as before. <span class="accented">Upon the air</span>; perhaps as the typical abode of the spirits of evil (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, "the prince of the power of the air"); the seat also, so to speak, of the thunders and lightnings which follow. <span class="cmt_word">And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</span> There are slight variations in the text here. The best authorities omit "of heaven." One manuscript, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, instead of "throne" inserts <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "of God." (On the characteristic <span class="accented">great voice</span>, see on Revelation 6:1, etc.) The same voice as in ver. 1, probably that of God himself, as the words, "from the throne," seem also to show. It is noticeable that here, as in the seal visions and trumpet visions, we are not explicitly informed of the nature of the last vision. We have the accompanying circumstances described in ver. 18, which are always attendant on the last great manifestation, but the end itself is left unrecorded. In the seals, the last vision is described by the silence in heaven; in the trumpets, the nature of the last judgment is only vaguely alluded to in the triumphant heavenly song. So here, only a brief summary is given (vers. 18, 19) of what actually falls as the last extremity of God's wrath; a fuller account is reserved for <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a></div><div class="verse">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i>and</i> so great.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great</span>. The usual accompaniments of any special manifestation of God's power or presence (see on Revelation 4:5 and Revelation 6:12-17).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the great city.</span> The words which follow, as well as <a href="../../par/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-18.htm">Revelation 17:18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10, 16</a>, etc., leave scarcely any doubt that the "great city" here is Babylon.

The idea is probably that of total destruction, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, where a similar description is applied to Jerusalem. Possibly there is a reference to the trinity of evil mentioned in ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">And the cities of the nations fell.</span> <span class="accented">The nations</span> signifies the ungodly, who stand in the same relation to the godly as the Gentiles to God's chosen people (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>, etc.).

Such convulsions of nature generally, in biblical descriptions, accompany the near approach of the last judgment. Some writers interpret the islands and mountains of kingdoms (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9, 10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a></div><div class="verse">And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <i>every stone</i> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent</span>; <span class="accented">cometh down upon</span>, the present tense, rendering the description more graphic. Commentators usually quote 'Diodorus Siculus' (19:45), who mentions. as something marvellous, hailstones of a mina in weight; the mina being one-sixtieth of a talent; and also the account of Josephus, who speaks of stones a talent in weight being thrown by machines at the siege of Jerusalem (see Wetstein, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>). "The men," though not pointing to any particular group of men who have been definitely mentioned, nevertheless necessarily refers to the wicked, were are the object of this punishment. "Hail" is frequently mentioned as a judgment of God and is added here to heighten the general effect of the description (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a>; also <a href="../../par/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great;</span> <span class="accented">is exceeding great</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>).

This and the following chapters (to <a href="../../par/revelation/19-21.htm">Revelation 19:21</a>) consist of visions which are really included under the seventh vial, but which, on account of their length and elaboration, may be considered apart from the other judgments of that vial. In the preceding chapters we have had placed before us a conspectus of three classes of ungodly people, and the three principles of evil in their abstract form, as represented by the world (the first beast), the flesh (the second beast), and the devil (the dragon). The personal final overthrow of the devil is described in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. and 18, are devoted to the description of the judgments of the two former - the world, in its character of the openly hostile persecutor of the Church of God; and the other portion of the ungodly who, while still professing Christianity, find excuses for conforming to the worship of the image of the beast. The first beast is, therefore, identical with Babylon, and represents, as we have seen, the openly hostile and persecuting world power of all ages, of which, in St. John's time, Rome was the foremost embodiment. The second beast is identical with the harlot, and represents faithless Christians, the apostate portion of the Church. The very <span class="accented">raison d'etre</span> of the Apocalypse is to deal with these two forms of evil; to declare the overthrow of the one, and to warn and, if possible, reclaim those under the influence of the other. In the latter case, the warning consists in setting forth the judgment in store for faithless Christians; and as this is the course pursued with the former also, the two merge into one, and indeed are declared to be one. The apostle in substance declares that, though there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> difference between the two forms of ungodliness, there is in reality no distinction to be made, but both are involved in one common final judgment. He thus twice solemnly asserts that the harlot is Babylon (vers. 5 and 18). The comments upon the following chapters will be based upon this hypothesis, the reasons for which will be brought out more clearly as we proceed. The opening words of this chapter leave no doubt that the visions which follow are connected with the vial judgments. The "one of the seven angels" may be the seventh angel, to whom it pertained to unfold the circumstances connected with the last judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment.</span> <span class="accented">Hither</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>, without the verb, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a> and <a href="../../par/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>. Though this particular narration necessarily takes place after the account of the vials, yet we are not to understand that the events here related are subsequent to these related in the concluding verses of the previous chapter. Note the remarkable similarity between these words and these of <a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>, and the contrast between the bride, the wife of the Lamb, and the harlot who is connected with the beast.

There seems no doubt that this figure describes the degenerate portion of the Church of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As we have already seen, this symbolism is made use of by St. John to portray the faithlessness of those who are professedly servants of God (see <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>), and in this sense it is applied in the great majority of passages of Scripture where it occurs (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-3.htm">Hosea 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>). In <a href="../../par/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, and <a href="../../par/nahum/3-14.htm">Nahum 3:14</a> the term refers to Tyre and Nineveh respectively. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There is an intended contrast between the bride and the Lamb, and the harlot who allies herself with the beast (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A contrast is also probably intended between the woman clothed with the sun (<a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>.), bringing forth the man child, Christ Jesus the Saviour - the representation of the pure Church - and the harlot clothed in scarlet, the mother of harlots and abominations - the representation of the faithless part of the Church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Both the woman of <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. and the harlot of this chapter reside in the wilderness, that is, this world (see on Revelation 12:14); indeed, they are to men sometimes indistinguishable (cf. the parable of the wheat and tares). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The faithful Church, the bride, is called a city (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 9, 10</a>); so the faithless portion of the Church, the harlot, is identified with the city Babylon (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4, 5</a>). Other coincidences will be noted as we proceed. But it seems equally impossible to accept the view that this faithless portion of the Church refers to papal Rome, <span class="accented">and none other.</span> We must include all the faithless of God's Church in all time. If the fulfilment is to be limited at all, it seems more reasonable to suppose that the first reference of St. John was to the faithless members of the seven Churches to which he addresses the Apocalypse. But we are, no doubt, intended to see here a picture of the position of the unfaithful part of the Church wherever it exists, at any time, and which men are certainly not able always to specify and judge. On this point see Professor Milligan's 'Baird Lectures' for 1885, on "The Revelation of St. John." In lect. 5. he says, "But Babylon is not the Church of Rome in particular. Deeply, no doubt, that Church has sinned. ... Yet the interpretation is false .... Babylon cannot be Christian Rome; and nothing has been more injurious to the Protestant Churches than the impression that the two were identical, and that, by withdrawing from communion with the pope, they wholly freed themselves from alliance with the spiritual harlot. Babylon embraces much more than Rome, and illustrations of what she is lie nearer our own door. Wherever professedly Christian men have thought the world's favour better than its reproach; wherever they have esteemed its honours a more desirable possession than its shame; wherever they have courted ease rather than welcomed suffering, have loved self indulgence rather than self sacrifice, and have substituted covetousness in grasping for generosity in distributing what they had, - there the spirit of Babylon has been manifested. In short, we have in the great harlot city neither the Christian Church as a whole, nor the Romish Church in particular, but all who anywhere within the Church profess to be Christ's 'little flock' and are not, denying in their lives the main characteristic by which they ought to be distinguished - that they 'follow' Christ." (For the distinction between the harlot and Babylon, see above.) <span class="cmt_word">That sitteth upon many waters</span>. "The" is inserted in B and other manuscripts, probably on account of the reference in ver. 15, but is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, and others. This is the description of Babylon in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>, whence, doubtless, the expression is derived. In the place quoted, the sentence refers to the many canals of Babylon; but the interpretation of this passage is given in ver. 15, where the <span class="accented">waters</span> are stated to be "peoples." This fact sufficiently demonstrates that, though the imagery of the Apocalypse be taken from the Old Testament, it is not always safe to insist on an exactly similar interpretation; the symbols employed may be applied in an independent manner. That the harlot sits on many waters therefore shows us that the faithless portion of the Church is to be found distributed amongst "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</span> "Of the earth" is used here (as it frequently is) for the worldly as distinguished from the righteous; and the two classes mentioned indicate the universality of this faithlessness - it is not confined to any one grade of society. As we have seen (see on ver. 1 and <a href="../../par/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>), the figure of <span class="accented">fornication</span> is repeatedly used to describe faithlessness towards God. The verse, therefore, declares that this faithless portion of the Church has chosen rather to render to the world that love which is due to God, and to be connected rather with the powers of this world than to have its treasure in heaven. The expression, "wine of her fornication," is a repetition of that in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>, and is derived from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a> and Revelation 18:3).

In the latter reference the analogy is sufficiently close to lead us to believe that it is intended. <span class="cmt_word">Into the wilderness;</span> <span class="accented">a wilderness</span>, according to the Revised Version, which is the rendering of Wordsworth and others; but Alford strongly supports the Authorized Version rendering, notwithstanding the absence of the Greek article (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Some commentators have thought that the "wilderness" signifies the desolation which is the lot of the harlot (see ver. 16; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2, 19</a>; also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>). But we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the "wilderness" here is that spoken of in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6, 14</a>, which is symbolical of this world, particularly when we remember that the "wilderness" in both cases is the abode of a woman, who moreover is representative of the Church; though in <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. she represents the Church of God as a whole, persecuted by Satan, and in this place the woman is representative of the faithless part of the Church (see also below on "beast"). Vitringa, referring to <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>, and <a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 15</a>, and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-35.htm">Ezekiel 20:35</a>, arrives at a similar conclusion; it is a "wilderness of the people." <span class="cmt_word">And I saw a woman.</span> There is no article, but this vision, occurring immediately after the words of ver. 1, "I will show thee... the great harlot," identifies this <span class="accented">woman</span> with the harlot of ver. 1. This woman represents the faithless portion of the Church (see on ver. 1); that part which, following after worldly things, has thereby rendered to the beast the love and honour due to God alone. This woman is not identical with the woman of <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. The latter represents the faithful, the former the faithless, part of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Sit upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</span> Here again, as in "wilderness" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), we have <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "beast," without the article; but the identity of this "beast" with that of <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> is established by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the same outward characteristics of names of blasphemy, seven heads and ten horns; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its connection with "kings," etc. (vers. 12-14 and <a href="../../par/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19, 20</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its connection with the "false prophet" (<a href="../../par/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. and Revelation 19:20); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> its connection with the harlot - the one representing the world power, the other the faithless, worldly portion of the Church. That the <span class="accented">woman sits upon the beast</span> denotes, not that she exercises control and guidance over it (as Alford), for comp. ver. 16, but rather that the <span class="accented">woman</span> relies upon the <span class="accented">beast</span> for support and safety; thus presenting an accurate description of those who prefer to trust to the power and influence of the world rather than to God. <span class="accented">Scarlet</span> (whether the colour of the beast itself or of its trappings is immaterial) may signify either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the worldly pre-eminence and power of which it is the sign, and for which the woman allies herself with the beast; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the blood-stained persecution of which the beast is the author. The first interpretation coincides best with the words which immediately follow; the second one agrees with the description in ver. 6 and <a href="../../par/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>. (On the "names of blasphemy," as signifying opposition to and rivalry with God, see on Revelation 13:1.) The <span class="accented">seven heads</span> denote universality of (earthly) dominion, and the <span class="accented">ten horns</span> denote plenitude of power (see on Revelation 13:1).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">And upon her forehead <i>was</i> a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And upon her forehead was a name written.</span> Omit "was." <span class="greek">&#x1f4c;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "name," is dependent upon <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "having," in ver. 4. This practice was customary with harlots (Juv., 'Sat.,' 6:123; Seneca, 'Controv.,' 1:2). In <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a> and Revelation 7:3 the faithful members of God's Church have his Name in their foreheads; here the faithless ones, represented by the harlot, exhibit a spurious imitation. As God's Name marked the former as his, so the name Babylon, etc., marks the latter as belonging to the world (see on Revelation 16:19; 17:5; 18:2). The <span class="accented">name</span> consists of the words following, to the end of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</span> The word "MYSTERY" may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> part of the name, standing coordinately with "BABYLON" (Alford, Bleek, Hengstenberg, Vitringa, Wordsworth); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a description of the following title, being thus in apposition with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "name" (Auberlin, De Wette, Dusterdieck, Ebrard); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> an adverb used in the same sense as in the last case (Stuart). Whichever view be taken, there can be no doubt that the purpose is to draw attention to the fact which is contained in the following words - a fact which might otherwise be exceedingly difficult to receive. For the rest of the verso asserts that the harlot is Babylon; that is, that the worldly portion of the Church, though nominally Christian, is in reality identical with the world, which is openly antagonistic to God. Indeed, the latter portion of the verse goes even further than this. This faithless (though outwardly Christian) portion of Christ's Church is the <span class="accented">mother</span>, that is, the cause of the existence of unfaithfulness to God. So true is it that the professing Christian who is worldly minded does more to cause in others disobedience and unfaithfulness to God, than he who openly declares himself in opposition to God, and even persecutes the faithful; cf. the words to the Church in Laodicea, "I would thou went cold or hot" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15</a>). (On "ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH," see on ver. 4.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/17-6.htm">Revelation 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus;</span> <span class="accented">of the witnesses</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>). Another point of contrast between this <span class="accented">woman</span> and the woman of <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>; the former persecutes, the latter is persecuted. It may be asked - How can these words be applied to professing Christians, as they must be, if such be the interpretation of the "harlot"? The answer may be found in Jeremiah. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33, 34</a> and Jeremiah 3:1-11 we find the origin of this passage. Judah is a harlot (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1, 8</a>) with a sign upon her forehead (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>), who causes transgression in others (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33</a>; and compare above, "Mother of harlots "), and in whose "skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>). She is clothed in crimson (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) and golden ornaments (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>); her lovers will despise her (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) and seek her life (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>). Just as it was declared that in Judah was found the blood of the innocent poor, so here we are told that the faithless part of the Church is guilty of the blood of the saints. The reason is found in the inscription. The harlot is absolutely identified with Babylon. No distinction in guilt can be allowed between the openly hostile world and the faithless Christian. "He that is not with me," God declares, "is against me" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-20.htm">Matthew 12:20</a>). The description "drunken with," etc., is similar to that of Babylon in <a href="../../par/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>; and also in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration;</span> <span class="accented">with a great wonder</span> (Revised Version). Probably because the seer can scarcely realize that some who are professing Christians must be held guilty of such enormities; that the harlot, representing a portion of the Church, faithless even though it be, should be classed with the world, as represented by Babylon and the beast. Perhaps the <span class="accented">wonder</span> is caused by the fact that such a thing should ever be permitted to be; this leading to the following explanation, which shows how the unfaithfulness is avenged. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/17-7.htm">Revelation 17:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel?</span> <span class="accented">did thou wonder?</span> &#8212; the same word as in ver. 6. Though the seer cannot fully comprehend the terrible significance of the sign he sees, viz. that a portion of the Church is one with the hostile world (see on ver. 6), yet there are sufficient marks wherewith to identify it. The woman, the wilderness, the reliance upon the world power, the inscription, the similar description of Judah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2.htm">Jeremiah 2</a> and 3. (see on ver. 6), might have made the interpretation plain. <span class="cmt_word">I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns;</span> <span class="accented">the ten horns</span> (cf. ver. 5, which declares that this essential unity is a <span class="accented">mystery</span>). Observe, too, that the "mystery of the woman and of the beast" is all one. (On the "beast," "the seven heads," and "the ten horns." see on previous verses, especially <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>.) In ver. 1 the harlot is said to sit on the waters; here the beast carries her. The two statements are really identical; both the beast and the waters represent the worldly power found among "peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues" (ver. 14).

The latter part of this passage is related again in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>. <span class="accented">The beast</span>, as we have seen is the world power - Satan in his character of "prince of this world." Three stages are marked out in the existence of this world power: first, it <span class="accented">was</span>; second, it <span class="accented">is not</span> now; thirdly, it reappears, to be cast into perdition. The first period describes the condition of things before the sacrifice of Christ. Then it was that Satan ruled supreme in the world; that the power of the world - <span class="accented">the beast - was.</span> But Christ overcame the world (<a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); henceforth to all true believers there is "peace," although they may "have tribulation" in the world (<a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); for the faithful Christian the power of the world - <span class="accented">the beast - is not.</span> Yet, though for the true servant of God there is a sense in which it may be said that this power has no existence, it nevertheless exists in the abyss, that is, in its natural abiding place in the world, among the worldly minded, and thus may cause "tribulation" to the faithful. A further downfall is, therefore, prepared for it - that which will take place at the last day, when it "will ascend from the abyss to go into perdition." This nonexistence, contemporaneously with existence and subsequent reappearance, is exactly what is described in the wound healed (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>; see also the remainder of this verse). The period, therefore, embraced in these words is that of the whole existence of this world. It coincides with the period referred to in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a> and 17, and in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>.

They also make it appear that the explanation which the angel offers of the "mystery" is not one to be understood without some difficulty. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. The diversity of opinions on the interpretation of this passage is mainly owing to the fact that writers are not consistent in their application of symbols and numbers; in one place interpreting figuratively, in another literally. We have repeatedly seen that the language of the Apocalypse and its numbers are symbolical. The seals are not literal seals, the Lamb is not a literal Lamb, the beast is not a literal beast, etc. So here, the <span class="accented">mountains</span> are not literal mountains. A mountain is a symbol of power (see on Revelation 8:8); <span class="accented">seven</span> is the number significant of universality (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). The plain meaning of the passage, therefore, is that the woman relies upon a visibly universal power. This is precisely the idea contained in ver. 3, which describes the faithless part of the Church (the harlot) trusting to the power of the world (the beast). Of course, the most prominent form of this world power in St. John's time was heathen Rome, hence some writers believe that "the seven-hilled city," Rome, is referred to here - either pagan or papal Rome. And, indeed, this may be a partial fulfilment of the vision; but it is not the whole signification. To understand <span class="accented">seven mountains</span> literally in this place renders it necessary to interpret forty-two weeks, etc., literally in another. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/17-10.htm">Revelation 17:10</a></div><div class="verse">And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, <i>and</i> the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there are seven kings;</span> <span class="accented">and they are.</span> Here we have the same idea (cf. ver 9), with a somewhat different aspect. The phrase in ver. 9, "seven mountains," regarded the world power as one universal indivisible whole, without respect to particular times or modes in which it might be exhibited. In this phrase, "seven kings," we have the same world power viewed in its successive exhibitions by different nations; though here again we must be on our guard not to interpret the number <span class="accented">seven</span> literally of seven nations. The <span class="accented">kings</span> represent Worldly states or kingdoms; <span class="accented">seven</span>, again, betokens universality. We are thus told that this world power on which the woman relies is exhibited in the manifestation of power by successive nations, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Egyptian, Assyrian, Roman, etc., as many as have ever existed or shall exist; for this is the meaning of <span class="accented">seven. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come;</span> <span class="accented">the five</span>; <span class="accented">the one</span>; <span class="accented">the other.</span> Omit "and." Here, again, not literally <span class="accented">five.</span> The seer divides the whole series of antitheistic world powers into three groups, and he would say, some, probably the majority, of these are passed away; the second group embraces the world power as it is exhibited now, whether Roman, Jewish, or any other; in the third group are included those yet to come. Thus those writers who enumerate Egypt, Nineveh, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Syria, etc., in the first group, are partially correct, and only wrong in so far as they attempt to limit and define the kingdoms; and similarly also those who in the third group place the Roman empire after the barbarian invasions, or imperial Germany, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And when he cometh, he must continue a short space;</span> a <span class="accented">little while</span> (Revised Version). This "short space" describes the remainder of the time of the world's existence. Such is its meaning in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a> and Revelation 12:12, and again in Revelation 20:3. In a similar manner, also, "shortly come to pass," etc. (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5, 16</a>, etc.; cf also <a href="../../par/john/16-17.htm">John 16:17, 28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/17-11.htm">Revelation 17:11</a></div><div class="verse">And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition;</span> <span class="accented">and the beast</span> (neuter, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">that was and is not, he himself is also an eighth</span> (masculine), <span class="accented">and is of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, <span class="accented">out of</span>) <span class="accented">the seven</span>, etc. We may note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "eighth" refers to "king" in ver. 10, being masculine gender; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "eighth," shows that this is not the eighth in a successive series, in which the kings already mentioned form the first seven. The Revised Version probably gives the correct meaning, "is of the seven;" that is, the beast himself consists of, and is formed by, what has been denoted by the seven kings. We have already interpreted the beast as the worldly power - Satan in his capacity of "prince of this world." We have also shown that the "seven kings" describes this worldly power as it exists throughout all ages. This verse, therefore, sums up and reasserts briefly what has been already virtually intimated in the symbolism employed, viz. that the beast is the sum total of what has been described under the form of five kings, then one king, and then one king again (ver. 10). His final doom is also reasserted, "he goeth into perdition" (cf. ver. 8 and <a href="../../par/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet.</span> The <span class="accented">horns</span>, as we have seen, are symbolical of power (see on Revelation 13:1), and <span class="accented">ten</span> signifies completeness and sufficiency (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). By the <span class="accented">ten horns</span>, therefore, is expressed widespread, complete power. But this power, says the seer, has not come into existence as <span class="accented">yet.</span> He thus points to a coming power, hostile to God, such as is described in that part of the account of the seven kings which states "the other is not yet come" (ver. 10). If; seems probable, therefore, that in describing the forces opposed to God - those past, those present, and those yet to come - St. John foresees that the hostile world power will not be always pre-eminently wielded by one nation, as in his own time; but will be divided into many parts, here represented by the number <span class="accented">ten</span>, though not necessarily exactly ten in number. This, indeed, exactly describes what has really been the case since St. John's time, and what, humanly speaking, seems likely to continue to the end of the world. These <span class="accented">ten horns</span> seem thus to be identical with the seventh king of ver. 10. Compare the account given of the <span class="accented">horns</span> in <a href="../../par/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">But receive power as kings one hour with the beast;</span> <span class="accented">authority</span> (Revised Version). <span class="accented">One hour</span> denotes "a short time," in which way the Bible constantly describes the period of the world's existence, and especially that period which intervenes between the time of the writer and the judgment day (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>, etc.). This sentence thus declares that, though in the future divided into many parts, and thus not being visibly as potential as former single united kingdoms, nevertheless this hostile world power will be still formidable, having ranged itself on the side of the beast, acting for and with him, and receiving power from him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast;</span> <span class="accented">they give</span> (present tense) <span class="accented">their power and authority</span>, etc. That is, though apparently split up into many sections, they form practically one, acting by and for the beast on whose side they range themselves (see on ver. 32).

This war between the Lamb and the powers of evil is that which extends throughout the history of the world (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>); it occupies the "one hour" of ver. 12, which is equivalent to the period of the world's existence. But the seer in this verse looks forward also to the termination of the conflict, the result of which, here briefly indicated, is soon to be narrated more fully. <span class="cmt_word">For he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.</span> This is the reason given to the Israelites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>) for obedience to God (cf. also <a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>; and <a href="../../par/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). Though the beast may exercise m this world dominion and power as "prince of this world," yet the Lamb is King still greater, to whom the beast must finally succumb. He is thus <span class="accented">King</span> above the kings of <a href="../../par/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2, 10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</span> The Revised Version is more correct, <span class="accented">And they that are with him, called and chosen and faithful</span> [<span class="accented">shall also overcome</span>]. Another evidence of the lifelong nature of this war. Not only Christ wars and overcomes, but those associated with him are permitted to share in the battle and the victory. Christ's saints are <span class="accented">called</span> here to battle; in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> they are <span class="accented">called</span> to the marriage supper of the Lamb (cf. also the exhortation to <span class="accented">faithfulness</span> in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). The three epithets describe the progressive life of those who share Christ's victory They are <span class="accented">called</span> - as all men are - to serve him; having heard the call, they dedicate their lives to his service, and become his <span class="accented">chosen</span> servants; finally, having remained <span class="accented">faithful</span> to him, they share in his victory.

In ver. 7 we are told that the beast carries the woman. Both statements are correct. The beast is the world power, which is found among the "peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues." Are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues, The fourfold description of the human race (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, etc.), which, as a whole, serves the beast (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3, 8, 12, 16</a>), and out of which are selected the redeemed (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-9.htm">Revelation 9:9</a>).

These words describe the fate in store for the faithless portion of the Church. That world, to which she trusts, shall turn and rend her - a fitting sequel to her want of faith in the power of Christ. This is exactly the description given of the harlot in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-37.htm">Ezekiel 16:37</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-22.htm">Ezekiel 23:22</a>). "Eat her flesh" and "burn with fire" both describe similar results; possibly the one is thought of in connection with the symbol of "harlot," the other with the symbol of "city," with which the harlot is identical (see on ver. 5; but see <a href="../../par/genesis/38-24.htm">Genesis 38:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; cf. also the judgment upon the wicked rich in <a href="../../par/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>, "shall eat your flesh as it were fire").

"His mind" is thought by Bengel, De Wette, and Dusterdieck to signify the beast's mind. Others understand God's mind. In either ease the general sense is plain. While the world power is apparently performing the will of the beast, God is working above all; only by his permission can anything be done (cf. the "it was given" of <a href="../../par/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>.). The "words of God" are his denunciations against those who trust to the world (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-37.htm">Ezekiel 16:37</a>, quoted on ver. 16).

Many writers have been led by this verse to believe that Rome, either pagan or papal, is thus pointed out as the antitype of the harlot. That this is one fulfilment of the vision need hardly be doubted. Rome was in St. John's time the foremost embodiment of the hostile forces of the world. But this is not the whole fulfilment, which is in all time (see above, especially on ver. 1 of this chapter). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/18.htm"><title>Revelation 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/17.htm" title="Revelation 17">&#9668;</a> Revelation 18 <a href="../revelation/19.htm" title="Revelation 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a></div><div class="verse">And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven;</span> <span class="accented">after</span> [omitting "and"]...  <span class="accented">coming down</span>, etc. The usual form of introduction to a new vision (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>, etc.).

Since the harlot, who is identical with Babylon, is representative of the faithless part of the Church of God, these words form a direct warning to Christians. The departure which is commanded is not necessarily a literal, visible one; but the command implies a dissociation from, and condemnation of, the works of Babylon. Lot's wife literally departed from Sodom, but was overtaken with punishment, because her heart was not dissevered from the wickedness of the city.

The description is not to be taken literally, but is typical of a sudden and overwhelming reverse, viz. that which will occur at the last judgment day (cf. the words of our Lord in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-42</a>).

Some writers understand the "one hour" to refer to the space of time during which the kings rule (see <a href="../../par/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>); but a comparison with ver. 8 leads to the conclusion that the meaning is "suddenly;" the contrast in a short time between the two positions of Babylon enhancing the fearfulness of the visitation.

Alford here recognizes the difficulty in applying the prophecy to Rome, either pagan or papal, and adds, "I leave this difficulty unsolved ....

Such was the attire of the harlot (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>). Writers have endeavoured to classify in various ways the articles mentioned, in order to obtain some signification from the numbers used. Thus Hengstenberg sees four hard and then four soft articles mentioned, and he reminds us that the number four is symbolical of the world: but this does not carry him beyond ver. 12. The articles enumerated seem naturally to fall into six classes (from which we can gather no information, unless we look upon six as typifying the world, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>). First, articles of personal adornment; second, articles used for furniture, etc.; third, objects of sensual gratification - smell, etc.; fourth, articles of food; fifth, animate possessions; sixth, souls of men. These certainly seem to be arranged in a kind of progressive order of importance. All the articles mentioned in the text above were of the highest value. <span class="accented">Purple</span> and <span class="accented">scarlet</span> (see <a href="../../par/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>) were the prerogative of kings; <span class="accented">silk</span> was so scarce, that its use was forbidden in the reign of Tiberius. <span class="cmt_word">And all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;</span> <span class="accented">and every ivory vessel, and every vessel</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Thyine wood</span> is "that of the <span class="accented">Thuya articulata</span>, Desfont., the <span class="accented">Callitris quadrivalvis</span> of present botanists.

Not in the ordinary acceptation of the word "souls," but rather "lives of men," as the Revised Version margin; that is, "living men." It is probable that the two expressions, "bodies" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) and "souls of men," refer to two classes of slaves.

The "great voice," as usual, characteristic of the heavenly utterances (see <a href="../../par/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>, etc.). Again, we are not told whose the utterance is. It may well be that of all the heavenly inhabitants and saints in glory (cf <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). As usual in the Apocalypse, at the termination of a description of the last judgment comes the triumphant song of the heavenly host (cf <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>). Thus the account of the conflict between God and the devil, which was begun at <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, is here concluded at ver. 8; after which the narrative takes a fresh departure, once more returning, as it were, to the beginning, and tracing anew this warfare.

It is translated in ver. 5 of this chapter, as is St. John's custom (see on Revelation 9:11). It has been remarked that the word "Hallelujah" is chiefly used in connection with the punishment of the wicked; in which manner it is also used here. (For a similar ascription of praise, see <a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, etc.)

Alford suggests that the direction rather than the source of the voice is intended. It is impossible to say to whom the voice should be attributed (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4, 8</a>, etc.). As an invitation to the Church to praise God, we might expect the voice to be that of one of the elders. <span class="cmt_word">Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P, omit the first "and," thus reading: "ye his servants, ye that fear him," etc. The first words are a repetition of the "Hallelujah" of ver. 1.

These words connect the present passage with <a href="../../par/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>. They exhibit, as it were, the culminating reason for this adoration of God.

This is somewhat anticipatory; the full vision of the bride of the Lamb is reserved until <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. But the rejoicing over Babylon and the harlot naturally suggests the allusion to Christ's faithful Church, just as the vision of <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. is suggested by the concluding words of <a href="../../par/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>. "The marriage of the Lamb" is the figure under which is depicted that complete union between Christ and his faithful Church, which will be consummated at the last day, when Satan has been overcome and sin destroyed. It stands in contrast with the fornication of the harlot - the union of the spiritually unfaithful portion of Christ's Church with the powers of the world (see on Revelation 17:1, 2). Alford remarks, "This figure, of a marriage between the Lord and his people, is too frequent and familiar to need explanation (cf. in the Old Testament, <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>, etc.; and in the New Testament, <a href="../../par/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>, etc.)." This symbol of the <span class="accented">wife</span> or <span class="accented">bride</span> indicates the redeemed, who have already in several places been alluded to in this book (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, "they that are with him"). The saints have made themselves <span class="accented">ready</span> by enduing themselves with the robe of righteousness (ver. 8). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a></div><div class="verse">And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white;</span> <span class="accented">and it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright</span> [<span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="accented">pure.</span> The double nature of the process is here set forth. "It was given her," the power comes from God (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>, etc.), and yet "she arrays herself;" the action is still voluntary. (On "white linen," see on Revelation 4:4; 7:9; 15:6.) The following words are a sufficient commentary. This verse appears to contain the words of the writer, the heavenly song having ceased at the end of ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints;</span> <span class="accented">the righteous acts of the saints.</span> That is, their former righteousness, exhibited in fidelity to God and hostility to the world, obtained and retained by the grace of God, now forms their chief glory. So "their works do follow them" (<a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed <i>are</i> they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.

Cf. the command in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a> and Revelation 21:5, and the prohibition in Revelation 10:4; cf. also the expression in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, "Blessed are the dead," etc. It almost seems as if the writer has in his mind the connection of ideas indicated by the words quoted above on ver. 8, "Their works do follow them." The figure of the "marriage supper" is rather a new symbol than the continuation of the symbol of the bride; though very probably suggested by it. For those who partake of the "marriage supper" are those who constitute the bride, viz. the faithful Church of God. Cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, the words which are spoken by the "Amen, the faithful and true Witness" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>): "If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." It is impossible to say who the speaker is that thus addresses St. John, except in so far as may be gathered from ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.</span> Cf. the words of <a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, quoted above, and <a href="../../par/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; also the "Yea, saith the Spirit" of <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>. (On the word "true," see <a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>.) These words have been restricted to different portions of the Apocalypse by different commentators; but it seems best, on the whole, to understand them as referring to the whole series of visions connected with the harlot and Babylon and the faithful bride of Christ.

And he said unto me, See <i>thou do it</i> not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I fell at his feet to worship him.</span> The same thing happens again in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7, 8</a>, and this makes it improbable that St. John imagined the angel to be Christ himself, as some think. More probably (as Alford, Bengel, Vitringa, Wordsworth, and others) St. John was so overwhelmed with the tremendous character of the revelation just made to him, that in his humility he pays undue reverence to the angel who had communicated it to him. This reverence may not have been exactly of the nature of that which he would render to God; but it is evident, from the reproof of the angel, that it was more than could be becomingly and safely paid to a created being. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus;</span> <span class="accented">saith</span>...  <span class="accented">I am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren</span>, etc. So the apostles styled themselves (<a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>, etc.). (On "hold the testimony of Jesus," see <a href="../../par/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Worship God.</span> Such also is the command of our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> Like the words of ver. 8, these words are probably an explanation added by St. John. To prophesy is to understand and proclaim the truth concerning God, especially in the face of prevalent ignorance or opposition; this is also what is meant by holding "the testimony of Jesus." The angel in revealing these visions, the martyrs in openly professing Christ, St. John in receiving and handing on the Apocalypse, were prophesying. Thus it was that the angel announces himself to be the fellow servant of St. John, and a fellow servant with the prophets, and with those "who keep the sayings of this book" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him <i>was</i> called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse.</span> A new vision now opens, which is, however, part of the preceding series, commencing at <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. The destruction of certain forms of evil - typified by Babylon and the harlot - has been declared; the final overthrow of the dragon has vet to be related, though there may be no such separation in the actual infliction of these punishments as there necessarily is in the relation of them. The warfare now to be described must be understood to be that which is taking place between the hosts of Christ and Satan throughout the period of the world's existence. <span class="accented">The heaven opened</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>). A similar figure has been already employed in the first seal vision (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). It has been pointed out that the same image is employed at the beginning and at the end of the description of the warfare between Christ and the devil. He who is the First and the Last, the Alpha and Omega (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), rides forth conquering and to conquer (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</span> Even the participial construction here employed connects this account with <a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>. "Faithful and True" are the titles applied to our Lord in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, which see. <span class="accented">In righteousness he cloth judge</span>; cf. Isaiah's prophecy of Christ: "But with righteousness shall he judge the poor" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>); cf. ver. 2 of this chapter. The purposes of this expedition are "to judge and make war."

The plurality of "crowns" points to his character as King of kings (see <a href="../../par/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself;</span> <span class="accented">hath a name</span>...  <span class="accented">no, one knoweth.</span> Evidently the "new name" of <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, the significance of which St. John is unable to comprehend (see on Revelation 2:7; 3:12). From the connection with the preceding clause, we naturally infer that this <span class="accented">name</span> was written upon his forehead (cf <a href="../../par/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>); 16:1); but the writer does not explicitly state this. In B, twenty-five cursives, and Syriac, the words, "names written and," are inserted before "name." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a></div><div class="verse">And he <i>was</i> clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood;</span> <span class="accented">and he</span> [<span class="accented">is</span>] <span class="accented">arrayed in a garment</span>, etc. The idea here is evidently derived from <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, "I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury: and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment" (cf. ver. 15). Probably the similarity of this passage has caused the reading, "sprinkled with blood," which is found in a few manuscripts. In the original passage in Isaiah, the <span class="accented">blood</span> is doubtless the <span class="accented">blood</span> of his enemies; but it is possible that there is here a reference to the blood of Christ himself, which he shed in his warfare with Satan. <span class="cmt_word">And his Name is called The Word of God.</span> Only in St. John's writings does this title appear - a strong argument in favour of his authorship of the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>). This cannot be the "name" of ver. 12, which, as there explained, is unknown. This <span class="accented">Name</span>, the <span class="accented">Word of God</span>, is appropriately used when he is going forth to judgment.

Those commentators who consider that the angels only are intended, and not the saints, forget the double nature of the vision; it is not only a description of Judgment meted out, but also of a war waged. (On "white" and "fine linen," see previous chapters.)

Here we have described the destruction of the earthly manifestations of Satan's power; the means by which he seeks to achieve his purposes, and which we have interpreted as the hostile world power and self deception (see on Revelation 13.). The whole account contained in vers. 11-21 is a brief recapitulation of the whole period of warfare between Christ and Satan, with special attention given to the final overthrow of the powers of evil. It, therefore, covers the same ground as the vision of seals, and then that of the trumpets, then that of the vials, and afterwards that of the beasts, each occupies. The chief difference is that in all those visions the everyday conflict is more particularly described; whereas in this passage the termination of the conflict is specially brought before us. The same ground is covered in the next chapter, advancing, however, one step further, and showing us the final punishment of Satan himself, as well as of his instruments (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone;</span> <span class="accented">they twain were cast alive into the lake</span>, etc. (On "brimstone," etc., see on Revelation 9:17, 18.

It means the <span class="accented">unveiling</span> of Divine mysteries (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>), and from this it easily slips into meaning the mystery unveiled. Christ is both the Mystery and the Revealer of it. He comes to reveal himself, and in himself the Father, whose Image he is. Thus in its opening words the book takes us beyond itself. What is revealed is not secrets about the future, but a Person. And the Revealer is not man, but God; not John, but the Divine Son, commissioned by the Father. For even the unincarnate Word receives from the Father that which he reveals. <span class="cmt_word">Which God gave unto him</span>. This is remarkably in harmony with the Christology of the Fourth Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/5-20.htm">John 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-7.htm">John 17:7, 8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). The simple infinitive to express a purpose after "give" is common to Gospel and Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-52.htm">John 6:52</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His servants.</span> All Christians, not exclusively seers like St. John. "<span class="accented">Even</span> the things which" (Revised Version) makes "things which" in apposition with "the Revelation," which is probably right. <span class="cmt_word">Must</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); because God has so decreed. This Divine "must" is frequent in the Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shortly</span>. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> is much disputed. But, like "firstborn" in the question about the brethren of the Lord, "shortly" ought not to be pressed in determining the scope of the Apocalypse. Calling Jesus the <span class="accented">firstborn</span> Son of Mary tells us nothing as to her having other children. Saying that the Apocalypse shows things which must <span class="accented">shortly</span> come to pass tells us nothing as to its referring to events near St. John's own day. Probably it refers to them <span class="accented">and</span> to much else in the Christian dispensation. In the language of the seer, past, present, and future are interwoven together as seen by God, and more truth is contained than the seer himself knows. "The whole book ought to be received as a single word uttered in a single moment" (Bengel). It does not follow, because St. John had events near to his own day in his mind, that his words are limited to those events for us (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>:<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>; see Westcott, 'Historic Faith,' pp. 74, 75, and note on 1 John 2:18 in the 'Cambridge Bible for Schools'). <span class="cmt_word">Signified</span>. Jesus Christ signified, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> made known by symbol and figure, the things which must come to pass. "Signify" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is characteristic of St. John, to whom wonders are "signs" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of Divine truths. "This he said, <span class="accented">signifying</span> [by means of an allegory] by what manner of death he should die" (<a href="../../par/john/12-33.htm">John 12:33</a>; comp. 18:32; 21:19). <span class="cmt_word">By his angel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">by means of his angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). "Angel" here probably has its, common meaning of a spiritual messenger from the unseen world; but it is the fact of his being Christ's messenger, rather than his heavenly character, that is specially indicated. Whether one and the same angel is employed throughout the Revelation is not clear. He does not come into the foreground of the narrative until <a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 7, 15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1, 6, 9</a>). The Revelation is begun (vers. 17-20) and ended (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>) by Christ himself; but the main portion is conducted "by means of his angel." Thus St. Paul says of the Law that it was "administered by means of angels in the hand of a mediator," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Moses (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). In this case the mediator is John, a "servant" specially selected for this work (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). Thus we have four gradations - the primary Agent, the Father; the secondary Agent, Jesus Christ; the instrument, his angel; the recipient, John.

"To bear witness" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) and "witness," or "testimony" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), are characteristic of St. John's writings, and serve to connect together his Gospel, the First Epistle, and the Apocalypse. Such words should be carefully noted, and, so far as possible, uniformly translated, in order to mark their frequency in the English Version. The Authorized Version rings the changes on "bear witness," "bear record," "give record," and "testify," for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; and on "witness," "record," and "testimony," for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The Revised Version has here made great improvements. To bear witness to the truth and the Word of God was St. John's special function throughout his long life, and to this fact he calls attention in all his chief writings (see Haupt on <a href="../../par/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The testimony of Jesus Christ</span>, like "the Revelation of Jesus Christ" (ver. 1), means that which he gave, not that which tells about him. <span class="cmt_word">And of all things that he saw</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">even of all things that he saw</span>, taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in apposition with what precedes. The seer is here speaking of the visions of the Apocalypse, not of the events in Christ's life. The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, are rightly compared to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> of Thucydides (1:1; 6:7, 93). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>is</i> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time <i>is</i> at hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that readeth</span> this book publicly in the church, and <span class="cmt_word">they that hear</span> the book read, are equally blessed. There is grace promised to both minister and congregation who live up to the spirit of the Scriptures. St. John here suggests that a usage common in the Jewish Church (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>) may be adopted in the Christian Church. Probably this verse is the earliest authority for the public reading of the New Testament Scripture. It is very precarious to argue that "the Apocalypse, which points to this custom, cannot have been composed in the year 68," because this Christian custom is of later origin than 68. The official communications of apostles were sure to be read publicly in the churches (see Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>). Until the new lectionary came into use, the blessing here promised to the liturgical use of the Apocalypse was sadly neglected in the English Church. One might almost have supposed that a blessing had been pronounced on those who do <span class="accented">not</span> read and do <span class="accented">not</span> hear the prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">The words of this prophecy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of the prophecy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the prophecy of this book" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7, 18</a>). That which is a revelation in reference to Christ is a prophecy in reference to John. "Prophecy" must not be narrowed down to the vulgar meaning of <span class="accented">fore</span>telling future events; it is the <span class="accented">forth</span>telling of the mind of God. Prophecy, in the narrow sense of prediction, cannot well be <span class="accented">kept.</span> It is God's call to repentance, obedience, steadfastness, and prayer that must be kept by both reader and hearers in order to bring a blessing. And if the words are to be kept, they can be understood. We have no right to set aside the Revelation as an insoluble puzzle (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>, where, however, we have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The time is at hand</span>. The appointed time, the season foreordained of God (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), is near. We may ask, with F.D. Maurice, "Did not the original writer use words in their simple, natural sense? If he told the hearers and readers of his day that <span class="accented">the time</span> was <span class="accented">at hand</span>, did he not mean them to understand that it <span class="accented">was</span> at hand?" No doubt. But that does not preclude us from interpreting the inspired words as referring, not only to events near St. John's time, but also to other events of which they were the foretastes and figures. To us the meaning is that the type of the end has been foretold and has come, and the end itself, which has been equally foretold, must be watched for in all seriousness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-8.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">address and greeting.</span> Of this section only vers. 4-6 are, strictly speaking, the salutation; vers. 7, 8 constitute a kind of summary, or prelude - ver. 7 being more closely connected with what precedes, ver. 8 with what follows. The salutation proper (vers. 4-6) should be compared with the salutations in St. Paul's Epistles. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">John</span>. Evidently some well-known John, otherwise some designation would be necessary. Would any but the apostle have thus written to the Churches of Asia? St. Paul had some need to insist upon his being an apostle; St. John lind none. <span class="cmt_word">To the seven Churches</span>. From the earliest times it has been pointed out that the number seven here is not exact, but symbolical; it does exclude other Churches, but symbolizes all. Thus the Muratorian Fragment: "John in the Apocalypse, though he wrote to the seven Churches, yet speaks to all." Augustine: "By the seven is signified the perfection of the universal Church, and by writing to seven he shows the fulness of the one." So also Bede: "Through these seven Churches he writes to every Church; for by the number seven is denoted universality, as the whole period of the world revolves on seven days;" and he points out that St. Paul also wrote to seven Churches. Compare the seven pillars of the house of wisdom (<a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>), the seven deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>), the seven gifts of the Spirit. The number seven appears repeatedly in the Apocalypse; and that it is arbitrary and symbolical is shown by the fact that there were other Churches besides these seven - Colossae, Hierapolis, Tralles, Magnesia, Miletus. The repeated formula, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches," proves that the praise and blame distributed among the seven are of universal application. <span class="cmt_word">Asia</span> means the Roman proconsular province of Asia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the western part of Asia Minor (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace</span> be unto you, and peace. This combination occurs in the salutations of St. Peter and St. Paul. It unites Greek and Hebrew elements, and gives both a Christian fulness of meaning. <span class="cmt_word">From him which is</span>. Why should not we be as bold as St. John, and disregard grammar for the sake of keeping the Divine Name intact? St. John writes, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> "If in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a> the words may run, 'I AM hath sent me unto you,' may we not also be allowed to read here, 'from HE THAT IS, AND THAT WAS, AND THAT IS TO COME'?" (Lightfoot, 'On Revision,' p. 133). Note the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> to represent the nominative of the past participle of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which does not exist, and with the whole expression compare "The same yesterday, and today, and forever" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). Here every clause applies to the Father, not one to each Person; the three Persons are marked by the three prepositions, "from ... and from ... and from." It is a mistake to interpret <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> either of the mission of the Comforter or of the second advent. <span class="cmt_word">The seven Spirits</span>.

They are <span class="cmt_word">before his throne</span>, ever ready for a mission from him (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). The number seven once more symbolizes universality, plenitude, and perfection; that unity amidst variety which marks the work of the Spirit and the sphere of it, the Church.

The rainbow is called "the faithful witness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Firstborn of the dead</span>. Christ was the first who was born to eternal life after the death which ends this life (see Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>). "The ruler of this world" offered Jesus the glory of the kingdoms of the world, if he would worship him. He won a higher glory by dying to conquer him, and thus the crucified Peasant became the Lord of Roman emperors, "the Ruler of the kings of the earth." The grammar of this verse is irregular; "the faithful Witness," etc., in the nominative being in apposition with "Jesus Christ" in the genitive (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto him that loved us</span>. The true reading gives "that <span class="accented">loveth</span> us" unceasingly. The supreme act of dying for us did not exhaust his love. In what follows it is difficult to decide between "washed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) and "loosed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), both readings being very well supported; but we should certainly omit "own" before "blood." The blood of Jesus Christ cleansing us from all sin is a frequent thought with the apostle who witnessed the piercing of the side (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6-8</a>).

"Kingdom," not "kings," is the right reading. Christians are nowhere said to be kings. Collectively they are a kingdom - "a kingdom of priests" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), or, as St. Peter, following the LXX., gives it, "a royal priesthood" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).

It occurs twelve times in the Apocalypse, besides once without the articles (<a href="../../par/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>).

In the simple majesty of its solemn language it reminds us of the opening of St. John's Gospel and of his First Epistle. "I am <span class="accented">the</span> Alpha and <span class="accented">the</span> Omega" is here not followed by "the Beginning and the End," which the Vulgate and some other authorities insert from <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a> and Revelation 22:13. Who is "the Lord," that utters these words? Surely the Christ, as seems clear from ver. 17; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>. To attribute them to the Father robs the words of their special appropriateness in this context, where they form a prelude to "the Revelation <span class="accented">of Jesus Christ"</span> as God and as the Almighty "Ruler of the kings of the earth." Yet the fact that similar language is also used of the Father (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>) shows how clearly St. John teaches that Jesus Christ is "equal to the Father as touching his Godhead." These sublime attributes are applicable to each. Like the doxology (see on ver. 6), the statement of these Divine attributes increases in fulness as the writing proceeds. Here "the Alpha and the Omega;" ver. 17 and <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>, "the First and the Last;" in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End;" in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End." Of these four, the second and fourth certainly apply to the Son, and the third certainly to the Father, the first probably to the Son. <span class="cmt_word">The Almighty</span>. With the exception of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-18.htm">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>, where it occurs in a quotation, this expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) is in the New Testament peculiar to the Apocalypse, where it occurs nine times.

Bengel notes that it is in tribulation that believers specially love this book. The Church of Asia, particularly after the prosperous time of Constantine, had a low opinion of the Apocalypse; while the African Church, which was more subject to persecution, highly esteemed it. "Everything tends to show that the Apocalypse was acknowledged in Africa from the earliest times as canonical Scripture" (Westcott, 'On the Canon of the New Testament,' p. 238). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the isle</span>.

He does not say simply "in Patmos," as St. Luke says "to Rhodes" or "to Cyprus," but "in <span class="accented">the isle</span> that is <span class="accented">called</span> Patmos." Now <span class="accented">Patmo</span> or <span class="accented">Patino</span>, but in the Middle Ages <span class="accented">Palmosa.</span> Its small size and rugged character made it a suitable place for penal transportation. Banishment to a small island (<span class="accented">deportatio in insulam</span> or <span class="accented">insulae vinculum</span>) was common. "Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum" (Juv., 1:73). Compare the cases of Agrippa Postumus (Tac., 'Ann.,' 1:3) and of Julia (4:71). For a full account of the island, see Gudrin's 'Description de File de Patmos,' Paris: 1856. For the circumstances of St. John's banishment, see Introduction. It was in exile that Jacob saw God at Bethel; in exile that Moses saw God at the burning bush; in exile that Elijah heard the "still small voice;" in exile that Ezekiel saw "the likeness of the glory of the Lord" by the river Chebar; in exile that Daniel saw "the Ancient of days." <span class="cmt_word">For the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus</span>.

This is, therefore, the earliest use of the phrase in this sense. That it means Easter Day or Pentecost is baseless conjecture. The phrase had not yet become common in A.D. , as is shown from St. Paul writing, "on the first of the week" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>), the usual expression in the Gospels and Acts (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>).

"No longer observing sabbaths, but fashioning their lives after the Lord's day" (Ign., 'Magn.,' 9.). Melito, Bishop of Sardis (A.D. 170), wrote a treatise <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (Eusebius, 'Hist.

Comp. also Clem. Alex., 'Strom.,' VII. 12:98 (p. 377, Potter); Tertull., 'De Con.,' 3. and 'De Idol.,' 14, where <span class="accented">Dominicus dies</span> is obviously a translation of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; and fragment 7 of the lost works of Irenaeus.

Whereas, seeing that the visions which follow are grouped in sevens (the seven candlesticks, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials), the fact that they begin on the first day of the seven is eminently appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Great voice</span>. The voice is evidently Christ's; but throughout the Apocalypse the speaker is frequently not named. By a construction common in Hebrew, "saying" agrees with "trumpet," the nearest substantive, instead of with "voice" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). "Therefore it is from <span class="accented">behind</span>, for all the symbols and references are to be sought for in the Old Testament" (I.

Over and over again, twelve times in all, St. John reminds us that he writes this book by Divine command (ver. 19; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1, 7, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The seven Churches</span>. The order is not haphazard. It is precisely that which would be natural to a person writing in Patmos or travelling from Ephesus. Ephesus comes first as metropolis; then the city on the coast, Smyrna; then the inland cities in order, working round towards Ephesus again. In short, it is just the order in which St. John would visit the Churches in making an apostolic circuit as metropolitan. With the exception of what is told us in these chapters, the history of the Churches of Pergamum, Thyatira, and Sardis in the apostolic or sub-apostolic age is quite unknown. It was an ancient objection to the Apocalypse that in Thyatira there was no Church (see on Revelation 2:18).

As in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>, "the voice" is put for the speaker. This is the right method in studying the Revelation; we must, like St. John, "turn to see the voice." We must look, not to the events about which it seems to us to speak, but to him who utters it. The book is "the Revelation," not of the secrets of history, but "of Jesus Christ." Seven golden candlesticks. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>; and seven times in this book.

So also in <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>. It is by no means certain that a similar figure is not meant here; the seven-branched candlestick familiar to all who know the Arch of Titus. If the Christ stood "in the midst of the candlesticks," his form would appear as that which united the seven branches. But it is perhaps more natural to understand seven separate lamp stands, each with its own lamp; and these, in contrast with the seven-branched stand of the temple, may represent the elastic multiplicity of the Christian Churches throughout the world in contrast with the rigid unity of the Jewish Church of Jerusalem.

It is tempting to think that "the roar of the sea is in the ears of the lonely man in Patmos;" but the image seems rather to be that of the sound of many cataracts (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>).

These Churches are as planets, which shine, not with their own light, but that of the sun; which shine most brightly in the night of "tribulation," which (like him who holds them in his right hand) are a guide to the wanderer, and are ever moving, yet ever at rest. <span class="cmt_word">Out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword</span>. This metaphor runs through both Old and New Testaments. It is frequent in this book (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15, 21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, etc.). The sharp words of men and the searching words of God are both spoken of under this figure of the sword. Tertullian and Richard of St. Victor explain the two edges as the Law and the Gospel. Other still more fanciful explanations have been given. "Two-edged" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is literally "two-mouthed," and perhaps expresses no more than the thorough efficiency of the sword. It occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; also in classical Greek as equivalent to the more common <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. If a double meaning be insisted on, it may be found in the double character of God's Word, which not only smites the wicked, but searches the good; which cuts sometimes to punish, sometimes to heal. Thus in these very epistles to the Churches, penetrating words both of blessing and condemnation are uttered. The word for "sword" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs six times in Revelation; elsewhere in the New Testament only <a href="../../par/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>. In classical Greek it is the heavy Thracian broadsword. In the LXX. it is used of the "flaming sword" of the cherubim which kept the way of the tree of life (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); also of the sword of Goliath (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>:25). <span class="cmt_word">His countenance was as the sun shineth</span>. It is the "Sun of Righteousness" and "the Light of the world." The exceptional glory of the Transfiguration has become constant now.

How much more, therefore, would consciousness of the glorified Christ overwhelm St. John! Long years of contemplation of the incarnate Son would not prevent that. In like manner, Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>), Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17, 27</a>), and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>) are affected by the Divine presence. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not</span>. Thus Christ encouraged the terrified apostles on the lake (<a href="../../par/john/6-20.htm">John 6:20</a>) and at the Transfiguration.

The "Amen" has been improperly inserted after "forevermore" (see on "forever and ever," in ver. 6) from liturgical usage. Most English versions omit it. The keys, as so often, are the sign of authority (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>). Christ, as the absolutely Living One, who "has life in himself" and is the Source of life in others, has control, not merely over the passage from this world to the other, but over the other world itself. He can recall departed souls from their resting place. The error of rendering <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "hell" has often been pointed out; it is not a place of punishment, but the temporary home of the departed, who are awaiting the day of judgment. "Death," in all the best manuscripts and versions precedes "Hades;" and this is the logical order.

The true reading and most English Versions give, "write <span class="accented">therefore</span> the things;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because thou hast seen me and received thy commission from me. The omission of "therefore" comes from the Genevan Version. The threefold division of things probably refers to past, present, and future <span class="accented">visions</span>, not to the past, present, and future in history. But it is possible that "the things which thou sawest" refers to the visions, and "the things which are," etc., to the realities symbolized in the visions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mystery</span>. In construction this is the accusative after "write." A mystery is the opposite of a revealed truth; it is a sacred truth kept secret, the inner meaning of something which is perceived, but not generally understood. <span class="cmt_word">The angels of the seven Churches</span>. The meaning of these "angels" has been very much disputed. The common explanation that they are the bishops of the Churches is attractive on account of its simplicity. But it has very grave difficulties, especially for those who assign the Apocalypse to the earlier date of A.D. . It is highly improbable that at that very early time the seven Churches were already so fully organized as each to possess its own bishop. And granting that they were, and that the bishops might fitly be called "angels" or "messengers," would they not be called messengers of God or of Christ, rather than messengers of the Churches"? And would not the primitive Church have preserved this title as a synonym for "bishop"? "St. John's own language gives the true key to the symbolism. 'The seven stars are the angels of the seven Churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven Churches.' This contrast between the heavenly and the earthly fires - the star shining steadily by its own inherent eternal light, and the lamp flickering and uncertain, requiring to be fed with fuel and tended with care - cannot be devoid of meaning. The star is the suprasensual counterpart, the heavenly representative; the lamp, the earthly realization, the outward embodiment. Whether the angel is here conceived as an actual person, the celestial guardian, or only as a personification, the idea or spirit of the Church, it is unnecessary for my present purpose to consider. But whatever may be the exact conception, he is identified with and made responsible for the Church to a degree wholly unsuited to any human officer. Nothing is predicated of him which may not be predicated of it. To him are imputed all its hopes, its fears, its graces, its shortcomings, he is punished with it, and he is rewarded with it ... Nor is this mode of representation new. The 'princes' in Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20, 21</a>) present a very near if not an exact parallel to the angels of the Revelation" (Bishop Lightfoot, 'Philippians,' p. 198). The identification of the angel of each Church with the Church itself is shown in a marked way by the fact that, although each epistle is addressed to the angel, yet the constantly recurring refrain is, "Hear what the Spirit saith <span class="accented">to the Churches,"</span> not "to the <span class="accented">angels</span> of the Churches." The angel and the Church are the same under different aspects: the one is its spiritual character personified; the other is the congregation of believers who collectively possess this character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jude/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jude 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jude 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/20.htm"><title>Revelation 20 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/20.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/20.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/20-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/19.htm" title="Revelation 19">&#9668;</a> Revelation 20 <a href="../revelation/21.htm" title="Revelation 21">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw an angel come down from heaven;</span> <span class="accented">coming down out of heaven.</span> The usual mode of introducing a new vision (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, etc.). On account of <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, some have considered this angel to be Christ himself; but this is incorrect. As in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-9</a>, an angel is the immediate agent in this expulsion of Satan (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Having the key of the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">the abyss</span>; as in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>. In all these places the word signifies the present abode of Satan and his angels, whence they direct their operations in hostility to God, not the place of their final punishment (see ver. 10). In <a href="../../par/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> the word has exactly the same meaning; while in the only remaining place where it is used in the New Testament, viz. <a href="../../par/romans/10-7.htm">Romans 10:7</a>, it stands for the place of abode of the souls of the dead. <span class="accented">Having the key of the abyss</span> therefore informs us that power is given to this angel over Satan during the time of this world's existence. <span class="cmt_word">And a great chain in his hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">upon his hand</span>, as if lying on it and hanging from it; the chain evidently symbolizing the power of the angel over the inhabitants of the abyss, and the purpose with which he now comes, viz. to restrain the power of Satan. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan.</span> These titles are an exact repetition of <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a> (which see). <span class="cmt_word">And bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit</span>. <span class="accented">The abyss</span>, as we have seen (on ver. 1), is the present abode of Satan; the act of binding, therefore, is now over. This fact opposes the interpretation which makes "the thousand years" yet in the future. When, then, did this binding take place? Only one answer can be given. It was when Christ bruised the serpent's head by his act of redemption. Thus, "Christ was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>); "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out." (<a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>); "The prince of this world hath been judged" (<a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>). Satan is the strong man bound (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-26.htm">Matthew 12:26, 29</a>). Next, what is meant by "for a thousand years"? The best interpretation seems to be that this phrase expresses a quality, and does not express a period of time. That such a method of employing numbers is usual in the Apocalypse we have frequently seen (see on Revelation 1:4, "seven;" <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, "ten," etc.). Here, therefore, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a>, "one thousand" signifies "completeness." Satan is bound "for a thousand years;" that is, Satan is completely bound. In Ezekiel (from which the following part of the vision is certainly derived) a similar use is made of the terms "seven years" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a>) and "seven months" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-12.htm">Ezekiel 39:12</a>). But, again, in what sense can Satan be said to have been "completely" bound by our Lord's work of redemption? The answer is - In relation to the godly. The purpose of this sentence is that which is one great purpose of the whole book, viz. to encourage the struggling Christian. Thus this sentence assures Christians that, for them, Satan has been completely bound, and they need not despair nor fear his might (cf. "loosed," <span class="accented">infra</span>). The chapter thus describes, not a millennium of the saints, but the overthrow of Satan. Before the picture of the war and the overthrow, the saints are invited to behold the complete security of those who have not worshipped the beast nor his image; just as the vision of Christ victorious introduced the seal visions. <span class="cmt_word">And shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled;</span> <span class="accented">and shut</span> [it] and <span class="accented">sealed</span> [it] <span class="accented">over him</span>, etc. It is possible that there is here a reference to the death and burial of Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-66.htm">Matthew 27:66</a>). Satan "met in reality that fate which he was able, in a shadowy and temporary form, to inflict on Jesus - he was bound and shut up in the abyss, and the abyss was sealed over him" (Milligan. Cf. also the word "abyss," <span class="accented">supra</span>). Satan was thus bound "that he might deceive the nations no more," etc.; that is, Satan, in his character of the deceiver (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>) of the world, is thus limited in his power by the binding which has been described. <span class="accented">The nations</span>; in the sense of the world, not the ungodly world. <span class="cmt_word">And after that he must be loosed a little season</span>. Omit "and." "A little time" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is the exact phrase used in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>, where it certainly means the period of this world's existence. Such also is its meaning here. "He must be loosed" signifies that Satan is, in regard to the ungodly, allowed to work his will during this period. The thousand years' binding, and the loosing for a little time, describe two events which occur contemporaneously. While the godly need have no fear, because even in this world Satan's power as regards them is completely limited by Christ's act of redemption, yet in another sense, as regards the ungodly, Satan is loosed and obtains power over them. The chief difficulty in this interpretation lies in the words, "after this." But it must be remembered that the "thousand years" do not express a period of time, but the quality of completeness. Therefore the loosing of Satan must not be supposed to take place in a period subsequent to the period of the binding. The seer wishes to describe the devil in a twofold character, subordinating the second to the first. He thus says, "By Christ's redeeming work Satan is bound and fettered in regard to you faithful Christians; but there is also a second subordinate fact to remember, that at the same time he is powerful in his natural sphere, among his own adherents." The binding of Satan in one direction being immediately followed by a display of power in another, and the former fact being expressed by the chronological symbolism of being bound for a thousand years, it is part of this chronological symbolism to express the second fact as taking place <span class="accented">after</span> the first, though a subordination of the secondary to the primary effect is really what is intended to be conveyed (see Milligan, quoted above).

St. John continually thus describes the Christian's position; and such a picture is specially applicable for his purpose here, which is to portray the glory of the Christian calling, and the certainty of the Christian's hope. The redeemed have been made kings, and reign (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>).

In the same way the <span class="accented">souls</span> referred to in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a> are those existing during the period of this world, which we have here understood to be denoted indirectly by the "thousand years." <span class="cmt_word">And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</span> "The thousand years" adopted in the Textus Receptus, is found in B and others, but omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, and others. "They lived and reigned with Christ" in complete and perfect assurance, as in ver. 2, and for the reason given in ver. 2, viz. that, Satan was bound completely. This living and reigning must not be limited to the period after the death of the martyrs (though it is doubtless true in this sense also), notwithstanding the fact that St. John sees them here after their death. It is as though he would say, "You Christians sit upon thrones and reign with Christ; yea, even those who suffered shameful deaths shared this perfect safety and exaltation, though to the eyes of the world they were so afflicted and degraded." <span class="accented">They lived</span> is described in ver. 5 as the "first resurrection." This can only be referred to that first awakening from sin to the glorious life of the gospel, which St. John elsewhere describes in a similar manner. "He that heareth my Word...  hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life" (<a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>); "We have passed from death unto life" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This <i>is</i> the first resurrection.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished;</span> <span class="accented">should be finished.</span> Omit "but;" omit "again." It is important to notice the omission of "again;" <span class="accented">the rest of the dead lived not until</span>, etc. The best explanation of these words seems to be that the "rest of the dead" refers to those Old Testament saints and others (such as godly heathens) who were in the world before Christ's act of atonement - "the thousand years" (see on ver. 2, above)  -  had been accomplished. They could not be said to have <span class="accented">lived</span>, in the high sense in which St. John uses the word, not having known Christ; for "in him was life" (<a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a>, etc.). But by Christ's redeeming work, these were placed on a level with Christians (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/7-28.htm">Luke 7:28</a>, "John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he;" also <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39, 40</a>, "And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect"). <span class="cmt_word">This is the first resurrection.</span> These words refer both to the reigning of those mentioned in ver. 4, and to the living of those in ver. 5 (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). This "first resurrection" is the spiritual rising with Christ, which is a consequence of his redeeming work. It is to be noticed that St. John nowhere makes use of the phrase, "second resurrection," though he does use the words, "second death." Both the "first resurrection" and the "second death" are spiritual operations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed and holy <i>is</i> he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years;</span> <span class="accented">over these the second death hath no authority.</span> The first words describe the state of those who have part in the spiritual resurrection with Christ (see on ver. 5). The second clause gives to the oppressed Christian the culminating reason for patience and perseverance. The "second death" is the spiritual death of the lake of fire (ver. 14). <span class="accented">Priests of God</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). <span class="accented">A thousand years</span>; in complete and everlasting security (see on ver. 2, et <span class="accented">seq.</span>). We may in this place briefly indicate some of the other interpretations which have been given to this reign cf. the saints for a thousand years, or, as it is generally styled, the millennium. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The literal interpretation of a future reign on earth of Christ with his saints for a thousand years. According to this view, there is to be a first resurrection of the dead (either of the holy dead or of all the dead), then the period of a thousand years, during which Satan will be bound, and the saints will reign; then finally the ultimate punishment of Satan - the casting into the lake of fire. Some limit the locality of this reign to a particular spot on the earth (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerusalem), beyond which live the ungodly. The objections to this theory are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Amongst its advocates almost every detail is a matter of dispute. Some place the millennium in the future, others in the past. Of these latter some specify the first thousand years of the Christian age, others the thousand years from the time of Constantine. "The length of the period, the number and class of the believers who shall be partakers of its glory, the condition in which they are to live, the work in which they are to be engaged, the relation in which the exalted Redeemer is to stand to them," are all subjects for disagreement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The carnal nature of such a resurrection is at variance with the general teaching of the Bible, and unlike the spiritual nature which our Lord himself assumed after his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> If the saints receive a glorified body for that period, it is impossible to conceive of them as living in the world in its present state, and a large part of which is inhabited by the ungodly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> It is impossible satisfactorily to conceive what relations could exist between the saints in such a case and the ungodly. If Satan is bound during this period so that he can deceive the nations no more, whence comes the evil which exists among the ungodly portion of the world? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> There is no other example of a literal use of numbers in the whole of the Apocalypse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> The teaching of the Bible elsewhere not only negatively fails to support this view, but is in positive opposition to it, in such points as a continuance of evil after Christ's second coming; the existence of an interval between his coming and the judgment instead of a sudden coming to judgment (comp. <a href="../../par/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>, "I will raise him up at the last day"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The spiritual interpretation, which makes the thousand years expressive of the whole Christian age. This seems to a certain extent true, since what the thousand years signifies does have its effect during this time in the reign of the saints. But it seems inexact, since it makes the thousand years symbolical of a length of time, instead of a quality attached to an action. What is meant is not that Christ bound Satan during the period of the Christian age (though, as we have seen, there is a sense in which he is so bound as regards believers), for, on the contrary, he goes about like a roaring lion; but that he bound and overthrew him completely for all Christians by his redeeming work. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a></div><div class="verse">And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;</span> <span class="accented">are finished</span>; that is, the power of the devil having been in principle completely overthrown by our Lord (see on preceding verses), Satan is still permitted to wage war and exercise sway on the earth. "His prison" is the "abyss" of vers. 1, 3 (cf. also ver. 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a></div><div class="verse">And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom <i>is</i> as the sand of the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog;</span> <span class="accented">four corners.</span> The signification of "Gog and Magog" (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) shows in what sense "the nations" is used. It is in the limited sense of the ungodly of the world, not in the wider sense in which the expression is used (without any qualifying clause) in ver. 3. <span class="accented">Magog</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> is mentioned among the sons of Japheth who were the ancestors of the northern nations (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a> and Ezekiel 39:2). Hence the name <span class="accented">Magog</span> is used to denote the northern tribes, whose invasion of Palestine and adjoining parts took place about  <span class="date">B.C. 630-600</span>. From <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>, it seems that Gog was originally a leader among these tribes; and from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-17.htm">Ezekiel 38:17</a> it seems that Ezekiel took these names to be symbolical of all the foes of the people of God. Jewish tradition makes use of these names to indicate those nations who were expected to war against Jerusalem in the last days, and to be overthrown by the Messiah. Hence the employment of the terms here by St. John as denoting the ungodly people of the world, amongst whom Satan still exercises his power, though that power is limited to these, and he is completely bound as regards true believers. <span class="cmt_word">To gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea;</span> <span class="accented">to the war</span>; the article points definitely to the war of <a href="../../par/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a> and Revelation 16:14. It is a prolonged <span class="accented">war</span>, not a <span class="accented">battle</span>, because lasting throughout life. The vastness of the hosts of Gog and Magog is alluded to in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-9.htm">Ezekiel 38:9, 16</a>. This is in conformity with our Lord's teaching: "Many are called, but few are chosen" (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>; cf. also Revelation 7:14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they went up on the breadth cf the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city;</span> <span class="accented">over the breadth.</span> "They went up" as an army to attack the enemy (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>). Either we must render <span class="accented">the camp</span>...  <span class="accented">even the beloved city</span>, or else we must understand the <span class="accented">camp</span> as a defensive outpost placed around or near the city. In <a href="../../par/acts/21-34.htm">Acts 21:34</a> the same word is rendered "castle." "The beloved city" is evidently Jerusalem (of <a href="../../par/psalms/78-68.htm">Psalm 78:68</a>), that is, the Church of God, of which it is always a type in the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>). The description plainly portrays the Church militant here on earth. <span class="cmt_word">And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</span>. "From God" is omitted in A, a few cursives, and Primasius, but appears in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, l, 7, and most cursives and versions; but these authorities vary in the position of the added clause. So in <a href="../../par/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>. fire devours the enemies of the two witnesses. This sentence is introduced in connection with the description of Gog and Magog, following the account of Ezekiel, where the same punishment is foretold (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>). It is probable, therefore, that nothing more definite is intended than to convey the general idea that God aids and protects his Church even while on earth. He, as it were, gives the enemies of his people a foretaste, while here on earth, of their future punishment of the lake of fire (see also on the seal visions). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet <i>are</i>, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever;</span> <span class="accented">and they shall be tormented.</span> The last clause shows that this is the final judgment and punishment of the devil. Thus at this verse is completed the whole series of visions commencing at <a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, in which arc set forth the origin and progress of the influence of evil, and the final termination of the conflict between God and his Church on the one hand, and the devil and his adherents on the other. It remains now only to shadow forth the surpassing glory of the saints in their everlasting home, and thus to bring the book to a conclusion. This, therefore, is the theme of the remaining chapters. (On "the devil that deceiveth them," see on ver. 3; and on "the lake of fire and brimstone," see on Revelation 19:20.) <span class="accented">Shall be tormented</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>, "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?").

The destruction of the world is complete - "no place is found for them;" they are annihilated. Such an event is nearly always portrayed in the description of the last judgment in the Apocalypse and in the New Testament generally (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/16-20.htm">Revelation 16:20</a>).

This is the general resurrection; what St. John might have called the second resurrection, with regard to the godly, who have once before risen to a life with Christ (see on ver. 5). Now, those who would not voluntarily share in the first resurrection are compelled to share in the second. <span class="cmt_word">And the books were opened.</span> Omit the article (cf. the description in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And another book was opened, which is the book of life.</span> This book has been frequently referred to (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>).

In a similar manner, the first resurrection is the risen spiritual life of conversion; while the second resurrection is the resurrection of all men, and the bestowal of eternal life upon the just.

Having described the origin and progress of evil in the world, the final overthrow of Satan and his adherents, and the judgment when every man is rewarded according to his works, the seer now completes the whole by portraying the eternal bliss of the redeemed in heaven (cf. on Revelation 20:10). The description is based upon <a href="../../par/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>. and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; especially the latter, which follows the account of God and Magog, as does this. <span class="cmt_word">A new heaven and a new earth.</span> The dispute as to whether a new creation is intended, or a revivified earth, seems to be founded on the false assumption that the dwellers in heaven must be localized in space (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>, "I create new heavens and a new earth;" also <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.</span> The Revisers follow B and others in reading <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and render it by the English perfect tense.

Some interpret the <span class="accented">sea</span> symbolically of the restless, unstable, wicked nations of the earth, which now exist no longer; others understand the absence of <span class="accented">sea</span> to typify the absence of instability and wickedness in the New Jerusalem.

"The holy city" is the Church of God (see on Revelation 11:2), now glorified and prepared for perfect communion with her Redeemer (cf. the promise in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, which is now fulfilled; cf. also <a href="../../par/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10, 16</a>).

The same words occur in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> (which see). <span class="cmt_word">Prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span> Here is the contrast to the "harlot" (see on Revelation 17:1).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God <i>is</i> with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, <i>and be</i> their God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying.</span> <span class="accented">Out of the throne</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, and others; <span class="accented">out of heaven</span> is the reading of B, P, etc. As usual, the <span class="accented">voice</span> is described as a <span class="accented">great</span> voice (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>, etc.). It is not stated from whom the voice proceeds, but comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he shall tabernacle with them.</span> Still the seer is influenced by the language of Ezekiel: "And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>). Thus God makes his abode in his glorified Church - the New Jerusalem, among his spiritual Israel (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>, where this vision has been already anticipated). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God;</span> <span class="accented">and they shall be his peoples, and himself shall be God with them, their God.</span> The balance of authority is in favour of retaining the two last words, though they are omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, and others. Evidently the same words as <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a> (see above), "My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people." Cf. "God with them" with "Emmanuel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Now, the promise is redeemed in all its fulness. The plural "peoples" seems to point to the catholic nature of the New Jerusalem, which embraces many nations (cf. ver. 24; also <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a></div><div class="verse">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain;</span> <span class="accented">and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more</span> (Revised Version). <span class="accented">All tears</span>; just as in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces;" cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-19.htm">Isaiah 65:19</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.

It is uncertain what is the nominative intended. It may be the "words" just mentioned; or the incidents described in vers. 1-5; or the Divine promises and judgments in general. The analogy of <a href="../../par/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a> supports the last, but it is not conclusive. <span class="cmt_word">I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End;</span> <span class="accented">the Alpha and the Omega.</span> As the book opens, so it closes, with the solemn assurance of the certainty and unchangeableness of God's eternal promises (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>). The second clause interprets the first; a third form of expressing the same idea occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the First and the Last." I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. The same ideas are repeated in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13-17</a>. Again the symbolism of the prophet (cf. ver. 3). There is also another reminiscence of <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> (cf. also ver. 4 of this chapter). In exactly the same sense the words, "living water," are used in <a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "thirst after righteousness"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a></div><div class="verse">He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that overcometh shall inherit all things.</span> The correct reading makes the sense plain: <span class="accented">He that overcometh shall inherit these things, i.e.</span> the promises just enumerated. These words show the reason for the words of ver. 6; and may be called the text on which the Apocalypse is based (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>.); for, though the words themselves do not often recur, yet the spirit of them is constantly appearing (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>; see also <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I will be his God, and he shall be my son</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>, "And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people"). Some have thought that these words prove the Speaker to be God the Father; but it is impossible to separate the Persons of the Blessed Trinity in these chapters. This promise, first made to David concerning Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>), received its mystical fulfilment in Christ (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>), and is now fulfilled in the members of Christ (Alford). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a></div><div class="verse">But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death;</span> <span class="accented">but for the fearful</span>, etc. The construction is changed in the middle of the verse. The <span class="accented">fearful</span> are those who, through cowardice, have not overcome (cf. ver. 7). <span class="accented">Abominable</span>; those defiled with abominations (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>). <span class="accented">And murderers, and fornicators</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 2</a>). <span class="accented">And sorcerers</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>); those who deceived the heathen. <span class="accented">And idolaters</span>; the heathen who were deceived by them. <span class="accented">All liars</span>; all who are false in any way. <span class="accented">Their part</span> is <span class="accented">in the lake</span>, etc. (see on Revelation 20:10). These took no part in the first, spiritual, resurrection (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>); they now, therefore, inherit "the second death." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues.</span> Omit "unto me." "Full of" must be connected with "angels." Just as these angels had carried out God's judgments upon the ungodly, and one of them had exhibited the judgment of the harlot (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>), so now one of them shows the picture of the bliss of the faithful - the bride of the Lamb. <span class="cmt_word">And talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife;</span> <span class="accented">hither</span> (omitting "come"). The wording of this verse (except the last phrase) is almost identical with <a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>. The last phrase is the great contrast to the former chapter. In <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. I was seen a picture of a harlot, the unfaithful part of Christ's Church; here we have a description of those who have been "faithful unto death" (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>), and whose purity and faithfulness are symbolized under the figure of the "wife of the Lamb" (see on Revelation 17:1).

Some writers have, without sufficient reason, brought forward this verse as indicating that the writer of the Apocalypse was not an apostle.

The account given is that of a vision, and not of a reality, and therefore there is no need to attempt to reduce the enormous dimensions given here, as is done by some writers. The holy of holies was thus cubical in shape (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>).

The description, following that of Isaiah, makes use of earthly symbolism; but it is not, therefore, to be supposed (as Afford) that there will be hereafter a real earth with inhabitants. "The nations" are the redeemed, described in this way on account of their selection from every "kindred, and nation, and tribe, and tongue" (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>): not the wicked nations of <a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. Though the Authorized Version is probably incorrect in inserting "of them which are saved," yet these words appear to give the correct sense of the passage. The description is evidently still founded on the prophetical writings, "And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</span> Omit "and honour," according to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, and others.

The two expressions are peculiar to St. John's writings in the New Testament; the genitival form, which is the more Hebraizing, only occurs in this book in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1, 17</a>; whereas the participial and more classical form is confined to the Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>). "Living water," in its simplest literalness, means such water as is pure, flowing, clear, fresh, and wholesome; not stagnant, or turbid, or salt. Hence it is a proper term for the water of a beautiful and fertilizing river. Here, however, the genitival form reminds us of the familiar expression, similarly moulded, "the tree of life," which inclines us to think that" water of life" signifies water possessing life giving powers, water which restores, refreshes, supports life, and is therefore to be compared with "living water" taken in its spiritual sense. Of this whosoever drinketh shall never thirst again; when it has been once received within the soul, it becomes a well of water springing up into everlasting life (<a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">clear</span>, or <span class="accented">transparent.</span> We seldom use the rendering of the Revised Version, <span class="accented">bright</span>, as an epithet of water. <span class="accented">As crystal</span> (see note on Revelation 4:6, the only other place in the New Testament where the word occurs). The source of the river was in the Divine throne, the seat of the Triune God and the crucified Saviour. All eternal life is derived from our heavenly Father by the Holy Spirit for the sake of the Redeemer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a></div><div class="verse">In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, <i>was there</i> the tree of life, which bare twelve <i>manner of</i> fruits, <i>and</i> yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree <i>were</i> for the healing of the nations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the street of it.</span> This sentence appears to belong to the preceding verse, as in the Revised Version.

The singular "tree" seems intended to be understood generically of the whole of that class of trees. For this reason probably the LXX. renders the Hebrew of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a> by the plural "trees." We may see in this bountiful supply of the trees of life an image of the abundance of grace and life in store for the redeemed (cf. the description in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47.htm">Ezekiel 47</a>.). Which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; rather, <span class="accented">twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one crop m each month. The number <span class="accented">twelve</span> signifies completeness (see on Revelation 4:9; 7:4-9, etc.). This fruit is yielded twelve times as often as ordinary fruit. The signification, therefore, is that there is an ever present supply. The <span class="accented">fruit</span> is not of twelve different kinds; the tree of life bears but one kind (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>. "And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months"). And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>, quoted above, "And the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine"). "The nations" are not the heathen, but the multitude of the redeemed, gathered out of every nation (see on Revelation 21:24). It is, of course, not implied that there is, in the new Jerusalem, any disease which needs healing, but the tree of life is put forward as the means by which the perpetual health and life and general well being of the inhabitants are sustained. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a></div><div class="verse">And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall be no more curse;</span> <span class="accented">and there shall be no accursed thing any more.</span> Nothing accursed exists in that city, because there is no sin there. The narrative here passes into the future tense (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him;</span> <span class="accented">and the throne</span>, etc. This is the consequence of there being no accursed thing (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/7-12.htm">Joshua 7:12, 13</a>, "Neither will I be with you any more .... There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel"). God dwells in the city because all is holy. The throne of God and of the Lamb is one - God and the Lamb are one. Again, <span class="accented">his servants</span>, the servants of God and the Lamb (cf. <a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). They "serve him," as described in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1-7</a> and elsewhere.

All are pure it, heart, and therefore they see God. The same promise is made in <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>. The last clause connects this chapter with <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, and shows that these who are here described are those who have overcome (cf. also <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a></div><div class="verse">And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light;</span> <span class="accented">and there shall be night no more</span>; <span class="accented">and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun: for the Lord God shall shine upon them.</span> A repetition of <a href="../../par/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23, 25</a> (which see). In 21:23 we are told "the Lamb is the Light thereof;" here, "the Lord God shineth upon them." Again an assertion of the Divinity of the Son (cf. ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall reign forever and ever.</span> This prediction and promise ends the Revelation, as such. It is the reward placed before those who strive, in order to induce them to "overcome" (see on ver. 5 above, and <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-6.htm">Revelation 22:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, These sayings <i>are</i> faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me.</span> Probably the angel who has exhibited the vision of the holy city (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>); perhaps the angel of <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>. The concluding portion of the book is now entered upon; it contains a brief summary of (or rather reference to) the chief events which have been narrated, and enforces the lesson which is intended to be taught, viz. that Christians should persevere in well doing amid all persecutions, for their reward is certain, and that the punishment due to the wicked will surely overtake them at last. The angel asserts the veracity of what is contained in the book (ver. 6; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>); the time in which to prepare is brief (vers. 6, 7, 12; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3, 7</a>); the prophecy is to be communicated to others (ver. 10; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1-3</a>); God is eternal (ver. 13; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>); the just are rewarded (vers. 14, 17; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>); the wicked are punished (ver. 15; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>); the prophecy is to be faithfully handed on (vers. 18, 19; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These sayings are faithful and true.</span> That is, all that has been conveyed to the seer (cf. the following verses).

The expression is used here in connection with the "prophecy" mentioned in the following verse. The greater part of this verse is worded exactly as <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>. <span class="accented">His servants</span>; cf. the address to the seven Churches (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>, especially <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I come quickly: blessed <i>is</i> he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I come quickly</span> (cf. vers. 12, 20; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>). The narration passes into the words of Christ himself, just as in ver. 12 and <a href="../../par/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</span> Because they are "faithful and true" (ver. 6). The command given in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11, 19</a> is now supposed to have been carried out (cf. the same words in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8</a></div><div class="verse">And I John saw these things, and heard <i>them</i>.

The same statement is made in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a> (which see). "These things" are all that have been related in the book. <span class="cmt_word">And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things;</span> <span class="accented">and when I heard and saw</span>, etc. The tense here becomes aorist (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). St. John has once before fallen into the same error, viz. that of paying undue homage to the angel (see on Revelation 19:10). The beatific vision overwhelms him with awe, and he is bowed down with his own humility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith he unto me, See <i>thou do it</i> not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God;</span> <span class="accented">and he saith</span>, etc. (cf. the words of <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>). Here we have "the prophets;" in the former passage we have the "spirit of prophecy," in much the same sense; here, again, we have "them which keep the sayings of this book," in place of "that have the testimony of Jesus," in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>. In the latter case, also, there is little difference of meaning, since the "sayings of this book" are exhortations to a faithful bearing of "the testimony of Jesus;" those, therefore, "who keep" (that is, carry out) "the sayings" are those who "hold the testimony of Jesus." "The prophets" need not be restricted in meaning to either Old or New Testament prophets, but may include both. The direct inspiration of the message which St. John has to deliver is here asserted. In unison with the teaching of the Mosaic covenant, the angel commands to <span class="accented">worship God</span> alone (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</span> The visions being now complete, St. John is commanded to communicate them to the world (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4</a>, where a contrary direction is given). The last sentence is again a repetition of the assertion of the shortness of this our time of preparation (cf. on ver. 7). The revelation deals not with events far distant in the future, but with those immediately present; for this reason the message is to be communicated (cf. <a href="../../par/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>, where the reason given for "shutting up the vision" is that the visions "belong to many days to come," Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a></div><div class="verse">He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still;</span> <span class="accented">he that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still, etc.</span> (Revised Version). These words seem to be used ironically, as was sometimes the case with the prophets (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-27.htm">Ezekiel 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-39.htm">Ezekiel 20:39</a>). The intention seems to be to stir men up to a realization of the nature of their conduct in continuing to reject the warnings of God.

This is one of the fundamental truths enforced throughout the book; cf. the epistles to the seven Churches (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5, 10, 16, 17, 22, 26</a>, etc.). Similar language is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>. The infinitive phrase seems to be explanatory of the idea contained in the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "reward;" the double nature of the <span class="accented">reward</span> being thus indicated.

These words, which appropriately open and close the book (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), occur (like those in ver. 11 above) continually in Isaiah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>). All three titles are here combined, as if to finally gather up into one impressive assertion the titles hitherto used separately (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>).

"The tree of life" is that described in ver. 2, and promised "to him that overcometh" in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And may enter in through the gates into the city;</span> <span class="accented">by the portals</span>; that is, in the natural way of people who have a right to enter.

"The dogs" are those who are described in ver. 11 as "the filthy;" the term is proverbial amongst Eastern nations as an expression for what is most degraded. The epithets in this verse occur (with others) in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>. A contrast is forcibly presented between these wicked ones here indicated, and those who have (in the preceding verse) the right to enter the city, owing to their purity obtained by washing their robes.

(On "Root," see on Revelation 5:5; for "Morning Star," cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>.) At the word "David," the manuscript 1, from which Erasmus compiled the Textus Receptus, ends. In order to supply the remainder, which is deficient, Erasmus retranslated the Vulgate Version into Greek. The Greek, therefore, of the Textus Receptus from this point onwards is the Greek of Erasmus.

Of these we may safely set aside all those which make the seven letters to be pictures of <span class="accented">successive periods</span> in the history of the Church. On the other hand, we may safely deny that the letters are <span class="accented">purely typical</span>, and relate to nothing definite in history.

The Catholic Church, or any one of its branches, will at any period find itself reflected in one or other of the seven Churches. For two Churches, Smyrna and Philadelphia, there is nothing but praise; for two, Sardis and Laodicea, nothing but blame; for the majority, and among them the chief Church of all, Ephesus, with Pergamum and Thyatira, praise and blame in different degrees intermingled. The student will find it instructive to place the epistles side by side in seven parallel columns, and note the elements common to each and the order in which these elements appear. These common elements are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Christ's command</span> to the seer to write; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">his title</span>, which in most cases is taken from the descriptions in <a href="../../par/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="accented">praise</span>, or <span class="accented">blame</span>, or both, addressed to the angel, based in all cases on intimate personal knowledge - "I know thy works;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="accented">charge</span> or warning, generally in connexion with Christ's coming; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the <span class="accented">promise to the victor</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the <span class="accented">call to each individual</span> to give ear. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - <span class="accented">The epistle to the Church at Ephesus.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the angel</span> (see on Revelation 1:20). "The angel" seems to be the spirit of the Church personified as its responsible guardian. <span class="cmt_word">The Church of Ephesus</span>. "<span class="accented">In</span> Ephesus" is certainly the right reading; in all seven cases it is the angel of the Church <span class="accented">in</span> the place that is addressed. In St. Paul's:Epistles we have "<span class="accented">in</span> Rome," "<span class="accented">in</span> Corinth," "<span class="accented">in</span> Colossae," "<span class="accented">in</span> Ephesus," "<span class="accented">of</span> Galatia," "<span class="accented">of</span> the Thessalonians." Among all the cities of the Roman province of Asia, Ephesus ranked as "first of all and greatest." It was called "the metropolis of Asia." Romans visiting Asia commonly landed first at Ephesus. Its position as a centre of commerce was magnificent. Three rivers, the Maeander, the Cayster, and the Hermes, drain Western Asia Minor, and Ephesus stood on high ground near the mouth of the central river, the Cayster, which is connected by passes with the valleys of the other two. Strabo, writing of Ephesus about the time when St. John was born, says, "Owing to its favourable situation, the city is in all other respects increasing daily, for it is the greatest place of trade of all the cities of Asia west of the Taurus." Patmos was only a day's sail from Ephesus; and it is by no means improbable that the gorgeous description of the merchandise of "Babylon" (<a href="../../par/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12, 13</a>) is derived from St. John's own recollections of Ephesus. The Church of Ephesus was founded by St. Paul, about A.D. , and his Epistle to that and other Churches, now called simply "to the Ephesians," was written about A.D. . When St. Paul went to Macedonia, Timothy was left at Ephesus (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>) to check the wild speculations in which some Ephesian Christians had begun to indulge. Timothy probably followed St. Paul to Rome (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9, 21</a>), and, after his master's death, returned to Ephesus, where he is said to have suffered martyrdom at a festival in honour of the great goddess Artemis." He may have been still at Ephesus at the time when this epistle was written; and Plumptre has traced coincidences between this epistle and those of St. Paul to Timothy. According to Dorotheus of Tyro (circ. A.D. 300), he was succeeded by Gaius (<a href="../../par/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>). In the Ignatian epistles we have Onesimus (probably not the servant of Philemon), Bishop of Ephesus. Ignatius speaks of the Ephesian Church in terms of high praise, showing that it had profited by the exhortations in this epistle. It was free from heresy, though heresy hovered around it. It was spiritually minded, and took God as its rule of life (Ignatius, 'Ephes.,' 6-8.). <span class="cmt_word">Write</span> (see on Revelation 1:11; and comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>).

Stronger than "had" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>. This word implies holding fast and having full control over. In ver. 25 we have both verbs, and again in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>. A Church that had fallen from its first love (vers. 4, 5) had need to be reminded of him who "holds fast" his own; and one whose candlestick was in danger of removal had need to turn to him who is ever active (not merely is, but "walketh") "in the midst of the candlesticks," to supply them with oil when they flicker, and rekindle them when they go out. It is he, and not the apostle, who addresses them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Owing to the inaccurate use of a corrupt text, the Authorized Version is here very faulty. The Revised Version is to be preferred throughout. <span class="cmt_word">I know thy works</span>. This introductory "I know" appears in all seven letters. He whose eyes are "as a flame of fire" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>) has perfect knowledge of his servants, and this knowledge is the basis of the praise and blame. "Works," a favourite word with St. John, and very frequent in both Gospel and Apocalypse, is used in a wide sense, including the whole of conduct (comp. <a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39, 41</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8, 12</a> 2John 11 <a href="../../par/3_john/1-10.htm">3 John 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy toil and patience</span>. Explanatory of "thy works;" the Ephesians know how to toil and how to suffer patiently. They have "learned to labour and to wait." St. Ignatius says that he must be trained "in patience and long suffering" by the Ephesians ('Ephes.,' 3.). <span class="cmt_word">And that thou canst not bear evil men</span>. Again St. Ignatius supplies a commentary: "Now, Onesimus of his own accord highly praiseth your orderly conduct in God, for that ye all live according to truth, and that <span class="accented">no</span> <span class="accented">heresy hath a home among you</span>; nay, ye <span class="accented">do not so much as listen to any one</span>, if he speak of aught else save concerning Jesus Christ in truth" ('Ephes.,' 6.). The word for "evil" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), though one of the commonest in the Greek language, is rare in St. John; it occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a> (see note); <a href="../../par/john/18-23.htm">John 18:23</a> 3John 11. <span class="cmt_word">Didst try them which call themselves apostles, and they are not</span>. It is incredible that this can mean St. Paul. Even allowing the prodigious assumption that the "Jewish Christianity" of St. John was opposed to the "Gentile Christianity" of St. Paul, what chance would an opponent of St. Paul have had in a Church which St. Paul founded and fostered? And had such opposition existed, could St. Polycarp, St. John's own disciple, have spoken of "the wisdom of the blessed and glorious Paul" ('Philippians,' 3.)? This mention of false apostles is doubly interesting: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a fulfilment of warnings given by St. Paul himself to the Ephesian Church (<a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-30</a>; comp. 2 Timothy, <span class="accented">passim</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as a strong incidental mark of the date of the book. In A.D. , when contemporaries of the apostles were abundant, the claim to be an apostle might with some show of reason be made; in A.D.  such a claim would be ridiculous. This Trench admits, and hence tells us that the meaning of "apostles" must not be pressed, "as though it implied a claim to have seen and been sent by the Lord Jesus," But this is just what "apostle" does imply (<a href="../../par/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The text followed in the Authorized Version is here very corrupt; we must read with the Revised Version, <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast patience</span> (as in ver. 2), <span class="cmt_word">and didst bear for my Name's sake, and hast not grown weary</span>. The last verb (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is closely akin to toil (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in ver 2. The seeming contradiction between "I know thy toil" and "thou hast not toiled" has caused confusion in the text. Yet <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> does not mean "thou hast not toiled," but "thou hast not wearied of toil." It is all the more probable that this play of words is intentional, because "bear" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is used in two different senses in ver. 2 and ver. 3: "canst not <span class="accented">tolerate</span> evil men," and "didst <span class="accented">endure</span> suffering" (comp. <a href="../../par/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a>). "So is patience set over the things of God that one can obey no precept, fulfil no work well pleasing to the Lord, if estranged from it. The good of it even they who live outside it honour with the name of highest virtue...  . Grand testimony this is to it, in that it incites even the vain schools of the world unto praise and glory! Or is it rather an injury,' 'in that a thing Divine is bandied about among worldly sciences (Tertullian, 'De Pat.,' 1.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless I have <i>somewhat</i> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have (this) against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love</span>. The Authorized Version unwarrantably softens the censure by inserting "somewhat;" the Greek means rather, "I have (this grave thing) against thee." In "hath aught against thee" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23</a>) and "have aught against any" (<a href="../../par/mark/11-25.htm">Mark 11:25</a>), the "aught" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) is expressed in the Greek; here nothing is expressed. "Thy first love" is expressed very emphatically with the article repeated; "thy love, thy first one." The meaning of it is much disputed. It cannot mean "thy former gentleness towards evil men and false apostles." It may mean "thy love of the brethren," so much insisted upon in St. John's First Epistle. More probably it means "thy first love for me." Christ is here speaking as the Bridegroom, and addresses the Church of Ephesus as his bride (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2-13</a>). This thought would be familiar to the Ephesians from St. Paul's teaching (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23-33</a>). It shows strange ignorance of human frailty and of history to argue that "a generation at least must have passed away, and the thirty years from Nero to Domitian must have elapsed, ere the change here noted could come to pass." Does this writer forget the Epistle to the Galatians? In a very few years the Churches of Galatia had left their first love. The frequent and rapid lapses of Israel into idolatry show the same thing from the time when Aaron made the calf down to the Captivity. This verse is certainly no obstacle to the theory that the Apocalypse was written about A.D. . 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The exhortation and threat are clear as trumpet notes: "Remember, repent, and return, or I will return and remove thee." A modern heathen philosophy teaches us that in this world to be happy is to forget. That is not the teaching of Christ. The past is both an encouragement and a warning to us; therefore "remember." Some have to remember heights from which they have fallen; others, depths from which they have been raised; others again, both. Cicero ('Ad. Att.,' 4:16) would remember the one and forget the other. <span class="accented">Non recorder unde ceciderim, sed unde resurrexerim.</span> The present imperative here shows that the remembering is to continue; on the other hand, the repentance (aor. imp.) is a thing to be done immediately, once for all. "The first works" means "the fruits of thy first love." Christ will have <span class="accented">works</span>, not feelings. <span class="cmt_word">I come to thee</span>. There is no "quickly" in the true text; and the verb is present, not future (comp. <a href="../../par/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>). The coming, of course, refers to a special visitation, not to the second advent. The removing of the candlestick is not the deposition of the bishop, but the dethroning of the Church, cancelling its claim to the kingdom, severing its union with Christ. Compare "The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof" (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-43.htm">Matthew 22:43</a>). The warning would seem to have been heeded at first, judging from the account of Ephesus in the Ignatian Epistles. But the Church has long since ceased to exist. Ephesus itself is a heap of ruins. <span class="cmt_word">Except thou repent.</span> This repetition drives home the charge given above; repentance is the thing absolutely necessary, and at once. This shows that what Christ has against them cannot be a mere "somewhat" (Authorized Version in ver. 4). It is nothing less than this - that with all their discernment of evil, and zeal against it, they lacked reality. Their light still burned, but in a dull, lifeless way; their service had become mechanical. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-6.htm">Revelation 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - They are again commended for their good points. But it is possible to hate what Christ hates without loving what he loves. It is possible to hate false doctrine and lawlessness, and yet be formal and dead one's self. Who the <span class="cmt_word">Nicolaitans</span> were we cannot now determine with certainty. The name Nicolaus may be intended as a Greek equivalent of Balaam, but this is by no means certain. Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria write as if the sect of Nicolaitans existed in their day. A common belief was that their founder was Nicolaus of Antioch, one of the seven deacons. Irenaeus (1:26), followed by Hippolytus ('Refut.,' 7:24), supports this view; Ignatius ('Trall.,' 9) and the Apostolic Constitutions (6:8), are against it. The Nicolaitans may have claimed him as their founder, or similarity of name may have caused confusion with a different person. The doctrine of the Nicolaitans, and that of Balaam (ver. 14), and that of the woman Jezebel (ver. 20), seem to have this much in common - a contention that the freedom of the Christian placed him above the moral Law. Neither idolatry nor sensuality could harm those who had been made free by Christ. The moral enactments of the Law had been abrogated by the gospel, no less than the ceremonial. The special mention of "the pollutions of idols" and "fornication," in the decrees of the Council of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20, 29</a>), seems to show that this pernicious doctrine was already in existence in A.D. . In <a href="../../par/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2</a> and <a href="../../par/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7-13</a> a similar evil is denounced. It appears in other heretical sects, especially those of Gnostic origin, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Cerinthians, Cainites, Carpocratians. In this way we may explain the statement of Eusebius ('Hist. Eccl.,' 3:29), that the Nieelaitan heresy lasted only for a short time; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its religious libertinism did not die out, but passed over into other sects. Note that it is "the <span class="accented">works</span> of the Nicolaitans," not the men themselves, that Christ hates. He loves the sinner, while he hates the sin. "It would have been well with the Church had this always been remembered" (Alford). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear, let him hear</span>. These solemn conclusions of these epistles remind us of the conclusion of many of Christ's parables (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9, 23</a>, [7:16]; <a href="../../par/luke/8-8.htm">Luke 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/14-35.htm">Luke 14:35</a>; not in St. John's Gospel, in which there are no parables). It is very noteworthy that, although the epistle is addressed in each case to a Church in the person of its angel, yet the concluding exhortation and promise are always addressed to the individual Christian. Each must hear for himself. His Church may perish, yet, if he overcomes, he shall live. His Church may be crowned with eternal life, yet, if he is overcome, he will lose the reward. <span class="cmt_word">What the Spirit saith to the Churches</span>; not "what he saith to <span class="accented">this</span> Church." The contents of each epistle are for all; for each individual Christian and for the Church at large, as well as for the particular Church addressed in the epistle. The epistle in each case is not from John, who is only the instrument, but from the Son of God and from the Spirit of God (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). In the first three epistles the exhortation to hearken <span class="accented">precedes</span> the promise to the victor; in the four last it <span class="accented">follows</span> the promise, and closes the epistle. Is this change of arrangement accidental or deliberate? There should be a full stop at "Churches." In the Authorized Version it looks as if "what the Spirit saith" were confined to the promise in the second half of the verse. This error was avoided by Tyndale and Cranmer. It comes from the Genevan and the Rhemish Versions. The verb to "overcome" or "conquer" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>) is strongly characteristic of St. John. It occurs seven times in the Gospel and the First Epistle, and sixteen times in the Revelation; elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/luke/11-22.htm">Luke 11:22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a> (quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) and Romans 12:21; comp. especially Revelation 21:7, where, as in these epistles, it is not stated <span class="accented">what</span> is to be overcome. We might render, "to the victor," or "to the conqueror." The expression, "tree of life," of course comes from Genesis; we have it again in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2, 14</a>. It means the tree which gives life. So also "the water of life" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>) and "the bread of life" (<a href="../../par/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). In all these cases "life" is <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, the vital principle which man shares with God, not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the life which he shares with his fellow men. The latter word occurs less than a dozen times in the New Testament; the former, which sums up the New Testament, occurs more than a hundred times. The Paradise of God. The word "Paradise" occurs only thrice in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>). It is of Persian origin, and signified a park or pleasure ground. In the New Testament it seems to mean the resting place of departed saints. There is strong evidence (B, versions, Cyprian, Origen) in favour of reading, "the Paradise of <span class="accented">my</span> God" (see notes on Revelation 3:2, 12). In considering this passage, <a href="../../par/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a> should be carefully compared with <a href="../../par/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>. "For him who conquers" the curse which barred Adam from the tree of life will be revoked by Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - <span class="accented">The epistle to the Church at Smyrna.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The metropolitan, setting out from Ephesus to visit the Churches of Asia, would naturally go first to Smyrna. It ranked as one of the most beautiful cities in Asia; but its magnificence must at times have seemed poor compensation for the neglect of the architect, who, in planning the city for Antigonus and Lysimachus, omitted the drains. In time of floods the streets became open sewers. For its fidelity to Rome against Mithridates, it received exceptional privileges, but suffered heavily when Dolabella laid siege to Trebonius, one of Caesar's assassins, who had taken refuge there. When eleven cities of Asia competed for the honour of erecting a temple to Tiberius, the senate decided in favour of Smyrna. This temple was no doubt standing in St. John's time. But just as Artemis was the great goddess of the Ephesians, so Dionysus was the great god of Smyrna. Dionysus represented the mysteriously productive and intoxicating powers of nature - powers which are exhibited most abundantly in the vine, which in the neighbourhood of Smyrna is said to have borne fruit twice in a year. He was regarded as the dispenser of joy and fertility, the disperser of sorrow and care. Hence the myth of his death and resurrection, which was frequently rehearsed and acted at Smyrna - a fact which gives special point to the greeting in this epistle - "From him who became dead, and lived." The priests who presided at this celebration were presented with a crown; to which there may be allusion in the promise, "I will give thee the crown of life." Not long after the martyrdom of its first bishop, St. Polycarp, Smyrna was destroyed by an earthquake, in A.D. , and was rebuilt by Marcus Aurelius. Earthquakes, fires, and pestilences have always been common there. But in spite of such calamities, it continues to flourish. From the large proportion of Christians there, it is known among Mohammedans as "the infidel city." Christianity seems never to have been extinguished in Smyrna, which shares, with Philadelphia, the honour of receiving unmixed praise in these epistles. "Down from the apostolic times a Church has existed here, and she has repeated, with more or less boldness and distinctness, the testimony of her martyr bishop, '<span class="accented">I am a Christian'"</span> (R. Vaughan). The stadium in which he suffered may still be seen there. We have already (see on Revelation 1:20) decided that "the angel" of each Church is probably not its bishop. But, even if this were the meaning, this epistle could not be addressed to St. Polycarp, if he was martyred A.D. , in the eighty-sixth year after his conversion, and the Apocalypse was written in A.D. . <span class="cmt_word">The First and the Last, who became</span> (<span class="greek_word">e)ge/neto</span>) <span class="cmt_word">dead, and lived</span> (see notes on Revelation 1:17, 18). As in the epistle to Ephesus, the words of the address are taken from the titles of the Christ given in the opening. It is no mythical deity, with his mock death and resurrection, but the absolutely Living One, who indeed died, and is indeed alive forevermore, that scuds this message to the suffering Church of Smyrna. In the epistle to the Church in Thyatira we have what seems to be an allusion to the worship of Apollo, similar to that to the worship of Dionysus here. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <i>I know</i> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <i>are</i> the synagogue of Satan.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty</span>. "Thy works" has been inserted here and in ver. 13 in order to make the opening of all seven epistles alike. The uncials A, C, P, and the Vulgate, Coptic, and AEthiopic Versions omit the words in each place. The Sinaiticus inserts them here and omits them in ver. 13, where they are plainly awkward in construction. Like all wealthy cities, Smyrna showed the extremes of wealth and poverty side by side. It would be among the poor that Christians would in the first instance be found, and their Christianity would lead to their spoliation; in this much of their "tribulation" would consist. But thou art rich (compare the close parallel, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the blasphemy from them which say they are Jews, and they are not.</span> We have here strong evidence of the early date of the Apocalypse. Throughout this book "Jew" is an honourable name for the worshippers of the Christ; "Gentiles," a name of reproach for those who oppose the Christ (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, etc.). These persecutors of the Church of Smyrna are Jews in name, but in reality are rather Gentiles - opponents, and not worshippers of the Messiah. The view taken in the Fourth Gospel is utterly different. There "the Jews" are almost invariably the opponents of Christ; the word occurs about seventy times, and nearly always with this shade of meaning. Assume that the Gospel was written a quarter of a century later than the Apocalypse, and there is nothing strange in this. Long experience of Jewish malignity in opposing the gospel has changed the apostle's views respecting his countrymen. He has become fully convinced of the inveterate and widespread character of the national apostasy. To him "the Jews" have become synonymous with the enemies of the cross of Christ. Assume that the Apocalypse was written about the same time as the Gospel, and how shall we account for this utter difference of view in the two books? Assume that the Gospel was written long before the Apocalypse, and how shall we explain the fact that experience of Jewish hostility has turned the apostle's abhorrence of "the Jews" into such admiration that to him a Jew has become synonymous with a believer in Jesus Christ? It is remarkable that, in the 'Martyrdom of St. Polycarp,' the Jews are said to have been present in great numbers, and to have been foremost (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) in collecting wood with which to burn him alive. <span class="cmt_word">A synagogue of Satan</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>).

This usage soon became habitual in the Church (see Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' p. 4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <i>some</i> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer</span>.

The devil, who inspires the "synagogue of Satan," is to be allowed to afflict them, as he afflicted Job. (For "behold," see note on ver. 22.) The expression, "some of you" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), is an interesting link of style between this book and the Fourth Gospel and the Second Epistle; we have a similar construction in <a href="../../par/john/1-24.htm">John 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-17.htm">John 16:17</a> 2John 4.

The common meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as distinct from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, is here conspicuous; it is "to try" with the sinister intent of causing to fail. But what is temptation on the devil's side is probation on God's side (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ten days</span>. It is unwise to make anything either mystical or rigidly literal out of the number ten, which here is probably a round number. The question is whether the round number denotes a small (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19</a>) or a large number (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>). The former seems probable. It is not impossible that some analogy between their case and that of the "four children" (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12, 15</a>) is suggested by the ten days' probation. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou faithful unto death</span>; literally, <span class="accented">become thou faithful</span>; show thyself to be such (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Note how completely the angel of the Church is identified with the Church. In this one verse we have complete mixture of the two modes of address: "<span class="accented">Thou</span> art about to suffer...  some <span class="accented">of you</span>...  <span class="accented">ye</span> shall have...  I will give <span class="accented">thee."</span> "Unto death" does not merely mean "to thy life's end," but "even if fidelity involves death;" compare "becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The crown of life</span>. The Authorized Version, by ignoring the article ("a crown of life"), sadly detracts from the meaning. It is the well-known crown, the crown which is truly such, in contrast to earthly crowns, and perhaps with a special reference to the crowns given at Smyrna to the priests of Dionysus at the expiration of their year of office. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has been found in inscriptions at Smyrna in this connexion (comp. <a href="../../par/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where the same phrase occurs; also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). Excepting <a href="../../par/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> (where we have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the regular word for "crown" in the New Testament. "Of life" is the genitive of apposition; the life is the crown, just as in "the Word of life" (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>) the life is the Word. It is impossible to determine whether St. John has in his mind the crown of a king, of a victorious athlete, or of a triumphant warrior. The XII. Tables provided that he who had won a crown might have it placed on his head when his dead body was carried in the funeral procession. St. John, both at Rome and in the East, would have seen this ceremony, possibly in the case of a crowned priest at Smyrna. "The crown of life" would be the exact opposite of that. The narrative of the martyrdom of St. Polycarp draws to a close with these words: "Having by his <span class="accented">patience</span> vanquished the unjust ruler, and having thus received <span class="accented">the crown of immortality,"</span> etc. The writer seems to have had <a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> in his mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear</span> (see on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be hurt of the second death</span>; more literally, <span class="accented">shall in no wise be injured at the hands of the second death.</span> The negative is the strongest form; the injury seems to be of the nature of a wrong, and the second death is regarded as the source of the wrong (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>). In <a href="../../par/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a> "the second death" is almost personified, as here: "Over these the second death has no authority." The phrase is peculiar to this book (see <a href="../../par/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a> and Revelation 21:8, where it is defined to be "the lake of fire"). The corresponding phrase, "the first death," does not occur. The one is the death of the body, to which the faithful Smyrnaeans must submit; the other is the death of the soul, from which the crown of life secures them: though they die, yet shall they live, and shall in no wise die, forever (<a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). This second death, or death of the soul, is absolute exclusion from God, who is the Source of eternal life. The expression, "the second death," seems to be borrowed from Jewish theological phraseology. (On the repetition of the article, "the death, the second (death)," see note on ver. 13.)

The city lies north of Smyrna, in Mysia Major, or the right bank of the Caicus. Pergamum is first mentioned by Xenophon, and becomes important and magnificent under Attalus, the friend of the Romans (B.C. 241-197), and his son Eumenes (B.C. 196-159). Its library was second only to that of Alexandria; but Mark Antony took it to Egypt and gave it to Cleopatra. Parchment gets its name from Pergamum, and Galen the physician was born there. Pliny writes of "longe clarissimum Asiae Pergamum" - a description which probably has reference to its buildings. It still exists under the slightly changed name of <span class="accented">Bergamah</span>, or <span class="accented">Bergma</span>; and its ruins still tell of the magnificent public edifices which have caused it to be described as a "city of temples," and again as "a sort of union of a pagan cathedral city, a university town, and a royal residence." Its idolatrous rites were frequent and various, and the contamination which they spread is manifest from this epistle. <span class="cmt_word">The sharp two-edged sword</span> (see notes on Revelation 1:16 and Revelation 2:13).

The Authorized Version inconsistently alternates between "seat" (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-16.htm">Revelation 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>) and "throne," even in the same verse (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>). "The throne of Satan" has perplexed commentators. It probably refers to the infamous idolatry practised at Pergamum, which had a cluster of temples to Zeus, Apollo, Athene, Dionysus, Aphrodite, and AEsculapius. These all lay together in a beautiful grove called the Nicephorium, the pride of Pergamum, as the temple of Artemis was the pride of Ephesus. Some have thought that the mention of Satan points to the serpent, which is so prominent in the cultus of Aesculapius. But the context leads us rather to understand the abominations connected with the worship of Dionysus and Aphrodite. Others, again, think that "the <span class="accented">throne</span> of Satan" indicates the persecuting judgments pronounced against Christians; for Pergamum was a great judicial centre. We must be content to leave the question open. <span class="cmt_word">Thou holdest fast my Name</span>. We have the same expression (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with the accusative) three times in this epistle and again in ver. 25 and <a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>.

On the emphatic repetition obtained by denying the opposite, "holdest fast and didst not deny," see notes on Revelation 3:8. The Greek text in what follows is a good deal confused, and cannot be determined with certainty; but the general sense is clear. In any case, "my witness, my faithful one" (Revised Version), is more accurate than "my faithful martyr" (Authorized Version).

Of Antipas nothing is known. The name is a shortened form of Antipater, as Nicomas of Nicomedes, Artemas of Artemidorus, Hermes of Hermodorus, Zenas of Zenodorus, Menas of Menodorus, Lucas of Lucanus, Domas of Demetrius; and therefore is not derived from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. Much mystical trifling has been expended over the name Antipas, which no doubt is the actual name of a once well-known sufferer for the truth. Probably of the Pergamene confessors, Antipas was the only one who was called upon to suffer death. The silence of Church history respecting a martyr thus honoured in Scripture is strange. Attalus, one of the chief martyrs of Lyons, was of Pergamum (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' V. 1:17; comp. IV. 15:48). The repetition of <span class="accented">"where</span> Satan dwelleth" emphasizes this point, like the repetition of <span class="accented">"repent"</span> in ver. 5. It rather confirms the view that by "Satan's throne" is meant the judgment throne where the martyrs were condemned.

They are few in comparison with the things commended; but they are very serious; and there must be a sad want of care in the Church at Pergamum to allow such things. These corrupt teachers are alluded to in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a> and <a href="../../par/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a>. Like Balaam, they debased spiritual gifts to the vilest purposes, and thus became a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a snare or stumbling block, to ethers. Like the Nicolaitans, they held that the freedom of the gospel placed them above the moral Law, and conferred licence to commit the foulest sins. The liberty to eat meats which might have been offered to idols was made a plea for liberty to take part in idolatrous rites (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; Justin Martyr, 'Trypho,' 35; Irenaeus, I. 6:3), and for introducing heathen orgies into Christian ceremonies. The doctrine of these antinomian teachers was "the doctrine of Balaam," because, like him (<a href="../../par/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 4:06. 6; Philo, 'Vita Mosis,' 1. p. 647), they prostituted their influence to the seducing of God's people into idolatry and impurity. The similarity of this doctrine with that of the Nicolaitans is obvious; but that Nicolaus (which is equivalent to "conquering the people") is intended as a translation of Balaam (which is <span class="accented">possibly</span> equivalent to "lord of the people") is mere conjecture. That there were two sects side by side at Pergamum is the natural meaning of this passage; and though their doctrines were alike in being autinomian in principle and licentious in result, yet there is no need to identify them. Among countless small improvements made by the Revisers, note that the remarkable word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which in the Authorized Version is rendered in <span class="accented">six</span> different ways, is by them rendered consistently (<a href="../../par/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-25.htm">Acts 21:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14, 20</a>).

Probably, "As Israel had Balak to seduce them, and Balak had Balaam, so hast thou," etc.). Others take it, "As the Church at Ephesus has Nicolaitans, so hast thou." The reading of the Authorized Version, "which thing I hate," must certainly yield to that of the Revised Version, "in like manner," which is supported by all the best manuscripts and versions. In the Greek there is much similarity between the two readings, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x39c;&#x399;&#x3a3;&#x3a9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x39c;&#x39f;&#x399;&#x3a9;&#x3a3;</span>. "In like manner" refers to the similarity between those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, and those who hold the doctrine of Balaam. It confirms the view that two sects are meant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-16.htm">Revelation 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly</span> (see on ver. 5).

It is possible that there is here another allusion to Balaam. It was with a drawn sword that the angel of the Lord withstood him (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a>), and with the sword that he was slain (<a href="../../par/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>). Those who follow Balaam in his sin shall follow him in his punishment; and the Church which allows such things will have to suffer along with those who commit them (comp. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear</span> (see notes on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">To him that overcometh</span>. Again it is made clear that the individual can free himself from the corruption and condemnation of his Church. He may live in the very abode of Satan, and within hearing of damnable doctrines; yet if he overcomes the wiles of Satan, and listens to the Spirit rather than to the seducers, "he shall eat of the hidden manna which restores the spirit that the flesh pots of Egypt have weakened. He shall have the white stone of absolution, the true spiritual emancipation, which the Balaamite and Nicolaitan emancipation has counterfeited" (F.D. Maurice). "The manna, the hidden manna" (see notes on ver. 13), is differently explained: by the repetition of the article, the epithet "hidden" is made very distinct. There is probably some allusion to the manna stored up in the ark in the holy of holies (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>), and also to the true Bread from heaven, whose presence is now hidden from us; or the reference may be to the loss of the ark, with its contents, when Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem (2 Esdr. 10:22). There was a tradition that Jeremiah had hidden the manna, and that it would be brought to light again in the Messianic kingdom. A share in those things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, and to the heart of man never occurred (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>), will be granted to the conqueror - a foretaste of them here, and a full participation hereafter (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a> and <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). "To eat" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) is an insertion into the true text borrowed from ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">a new name written</span>. "White" and "new," as Trench points out, are keywords in the Apocalypse; and it is natural that they should be so. White is "the livery of heaven," where white robes, white clouds, white horses, and white thrones abound (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>). And "new" is almost as frequent as "white" in the book which tells of a new heaven and a new earth, in which is the new Jerusalem; where the inhabitants have a new name, and sing a new song, and where all things are made new (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-3.htm">Revelation 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1, 2, 5</a>). But in spite of the familiarity and appropriateness of the two epithets, "white" and "new," a sure interpretation of the white stone with the new name upon it cannot be found. Trench's dictum, that "this book moves exclusively within the circle of sacred, that is, of Jewish imagery and symbols," and that an allusion to heathen or profane customs is inadmissible, is arbitrary and cannot be proved. As already shown, there may be references to the rites of Dionysus, to the games, and to the crown placed on the corpse of a victor. Here there may be an allusion to the white pebble of acquittal used in courts of justice, or to the lot used in elections; and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> favours these views. Or again, the reference may be to the <span class="accented">tossers</span>, or ticket, which the victor in the games received to admit him to the tables where he was fed at the public expense. Among Jewish symbols a reference to the "stone with seven eyes" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>) seems to be quite out of place. Nevertheless, Trench's explanation of the "white stone" as an allusion to the Urim and Thummim, which the high priest wore behind the square breastplate of judgment has much that is very attractive. This precious thing may well have been a diamond, for there was no diamond among the twelve stones of the breastplate. On each of these stones was written the name of a tribe; but what was written on the Urim none but the high priest knew. The usual supposition is that it was the sacred Tetragrammaton - the ineffable name of God. All this seems to fit in singularly well with the present passage. But if this explanation is to hold, <span class="accented">"he</span> that receiveth it" must mean he that receiveth the white stone, rather than he that receiveth the new name. The "new name" is not a fresh name for himself (<a href="../../par/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>), but a fresh revelation of God's Name and nature, which only those who have received it can comprehend (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>). A variety of other explanations will be found in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "Stones," in Alford, and elsewhere. Whatever the allusion maybe, the general sense is clear. He that overcometh shall be admitted to the heavenly holy of holies, and to a glory and knowledge incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>). He shall be made a priest unto God.

From Ephesus to Smyrna, and from Smyrna to Pergamum, was movement almost due north. Thyatira is on the Lycus, close to the Roman road between Pergamum and Sardis. It was refounded and named Thyatira by Seleucus Nicator, after the conquest of Persia by Alexander. It was strongly Macedonian in population; and it is worth noting that it is in Philippi, a city of Macedonia, that Lydia of Thyatira is found (<a href="../../par/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>). An inscription in Greek and Latin shows that Vespasian restored the roads thereabouts. Three other inscriptions mention the dyers (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>), for which Thyatira and the neighbourhood ('Iliad,' 4:141) were so famous, to which guild Lydia belonged (<a href="../../par/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>). There is no allusion to the trade here; and modern authorities differ as to whether it survives or not at the present day. But the statement that "large quantities of scarlet cloth are sent weekly to Smyrna" (Macdonald's 'Life and Writings of St. John,' p. 187) seems to be decisive. Apollo, the sun god, was the chief deity at Thyatira, where he was worshipped under the Macedonian name of Tyrimnas. There is, perhaps, a reference by contrast to him in the epistle, in the opening description of the Son of God, and in "the morning star" to be given to "him that overcometh." A similar allusion to the worship of Dionysus was traced in the epistle to Smyrna. The modern name of the town is <span class="accented">Ak-Hissar</span>, "the white castle," so called from the rocky hill overhanging it, on which a fortress formerly stood. Of the nine thousand inhabitants, about three thousand are Christians, who have the trade of the place in their hands. The ancient Church of St. John the Divine has been turned into a mosque. This fourth and therefore central epistle is the longest of the seven. In some respects it is the most solemn of all. Here only is the majestic title, "the Son of God," introduced. In the introductory vision the expression used is "Son of man" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>). "The Son of God," frequent in the Gospel and Epistles of St. John, occurs nowhere else in the Apocalypse. It may be suggested by <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee;" for <a href="../../par/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> is quoted in ver. 27 (comp. also ver. 26 with <a href="../../par/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Who hath his eyes like a flame (see notes on Revelation 1:14, 15).

This glaring tautology is a mistranslation. The Revised Version is correct both in the order of the words and in the rendering. We have first the general statement, found in most of these epistles, asserting intimate personal knowledge: "I know thy works." Then we have, in two pairs, these works particularized, "thy love and faith," and "thy ministry and patience." Finally, we have the knowledge "that thy last works are more than the first."

Like Ephesus, Thyatira is both praised and blamed; but whereas Ephesus has gone back (ver. 5), Thyatira is going forwards. The two Churches are in some respects the exact opposite one of the other. In Ephesus there is much zeal for orthodoxy, but little love; in Thyatira there is much love, but a carelessness about false doctrine.

Others insert "many things" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>); the Sinaitic inserts "much" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;</span>); while the best authorities have nothing between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>; and then <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> must be rendered "that" rather than "because." The construction is the same as in ver. 4. There is a right and a wrong suffering; and the Church in Thyatira exhibits both. The enduring of tribulation (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) is commended; the toleration of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) is rebuked. It is not said that Jezebel receives sympathy or encouragement, but merely that she is let alone; her wickedness is left unchecked, and that is sinful. For this use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, comp. <a href="../../par/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-7.htm">John 12:7</a>. It is difficult to decide between "the woman" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) and "thy wife" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), authorities being much divided; the balance seems in favour of the former. But even if "thy wife" be preferred, there is no need to understand Jezebel as indicating a distinct person. We are in the region of figures and metaphors. Perhaps all that is indicated is that the angel of the Church at Thyatira is suffering from the tolerated presence of a baneful influence, as did Ahab, "whom <span class="accented">Jezebel his wife</span> stirred up" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). And if it is not certain that any individual false prophetess is signified, it is scarcely worth while to speculate as to who this individual is. Jezebel may be a person, or she may be a form of false doctrine personified. If the former, Jezebel is doubtless not her real name, but a symbolical name of reproach, and what her name and status were we have no means of knowing. In any case the error represented by the name is closely akin to that of the Nicolaitans and to "the doctrine of Balaam." Whatever differences of detail there may have been, all three made Christian liberty a plea for an antichristian licence which claimed to be above the moral Law. And she teacheth and seduceth. This is an independent statement, and must not, as in the Authorized Version, be made to depend upon "thou sufferest."

The word for "seduce," or "lead astray" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>), in the active is frequent in St. John, especially in Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a> 13:14; 19:20; 20:3, 8, 10; <a href="../../par/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). A comparison of these passages will lead to the conclusion that the word implies seduction into error of a very grave kind. It is not clear whether "fornication" is to be understood literally, or, as often in the Old Testament, in the spiritual sense of idolatry. The former seems more probable. "My servants" means all Christians, as is clear from <a href="../../par/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a> and Revelation 22:3; it must not be limited to those in authority in the Church. (For "things sacrificed to idols," see notes on ver. 14.)

Forbearance having failed, God tries severity; and, as so often in his dealings with man, the instrument of wrong doing is made the instrument of punishment. The bed of sin becomes a bed of suffering. Compare "In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine;" and "I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is one of many words which has become weakened in meaning in late Greek: it often means no more than "place" or "put" (<a href="../../par/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>).

Idolatry is spoken of both as whoredom and as adultery. In the one case it is a <span class="accented">contrast to</span> the marriage tie between God and his faithful worshippers; in the other it is a <span class="accented">violation</span> of it. Jezebel anticipates the harlot of <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, as Balaam anticipates the false prophet of <a href="../../par/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>.

But the point is that those who have become partakers in her sins have abandoned their own works for hers; and it is therefore from her works that they are bidden to repent (compare "my works" in ver. 26).

The "and" after "I say" in the Authorized Version is a false reading, which it shares with the Vulgate and Luther: "to you" and "to the rest" are in apposition. Which know not the deep things of Satan, as they say. Two questions confront us here, and it is not possible to answer either with certainty: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Who is it who say something? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What is it that they say? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Note that "say" (Revised Version), not "speak" (Authorized Version), is right; the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The nominative to "say" may be either the faithful in Thyatira, "who have not this doctrine," and who show their detestation of it by calling it "the deep things of Satan;" or the holders of this doctrine, who profess to be in the possession of profound knowledge of a mysterious kind. Of these two the former is rather tame in meaning. Moreover, we should have expected "as <span class="accented">ye</span> say" to harmonize with "to you I say." Therefore we may suppose that it is those who <span class="accented">have</span> this doctrine who are indicated in "as they say." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What, then, did they say? Did they call their doctrine "deep things," which the Lord here enlarges into "deep things of Satan," in order to declare its true character? Or did they themselves call their knowledge "the deep things of Satan," which they fathomed in order to prove their mastery over them? The former seems better. It is improbable that any sect, nominally Christian, would in so many words claim special knowledge of "the deep things of Satan." Rather, he who condemns the "synagogue of Satan" (ver. 9) at Smyrna, and the "throne of Satan" (ver. 13) at Pergamum, here condemns the "deep things of Satan" at Thyatim. In any case, "deep things" is the prominent thought. It is some early form of Gnosticism that is indicated, and we know from various sources that "deep" was a favourite expression of theirs with regard to the knowledge which they professed. "The Valen-tinians have formed Eleusinian orgies, consecrated by a mighty silence, having nothing heavenly in them but their mystery. If, in good faith, you ask questions with contracted forehead and frowning brow, they say, '<span class="accented">It is profound'"</span> (Tert., 'Adv. Valent.,' 1.). Similarly, Irenaeus states that they claimed to have found out the "deep things of Bythos" <span class="accented">- "profunda Bythi adinvenisse se dicunt"</span> (II. 22:1). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to "depth") is the primary being or god of the Valentinian system, another name for which is <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to "unspeakable "). Hence elsewhere, for <span class="accented">profunda Bythi</span>, Irenaeus uses the expression <span class="accented">profunda Dei</span> in speaking of these Gnostic claims (II. 22:3). Similarly, Hippolytus ('Refut.,' V. 6:1) states that the Naassenes called themselves Gnostics, saying that they alone knew the depths - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is singularly close to what we have here. Note, however; that here the true reading is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, neuter plural of the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, not (as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, plural of the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. See also the fragment of a letter of Valentinus, preserved in Epiphanius ('Contra Haer. adv. Valent.,' 1:31). I cast upon you none other burden. An obvious echo of the decision of the Council of Jerusalem respecting these very sins, fornication and idolatry, in reference to Christian liberty (<a href="../../par/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28, 29</a>), where the very same word (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used for "burden."

"None other" means none other than a more determined opposition to these specious abominations. Hold fast your own doctrine, and denounce the false. Others, much less probably, interpret "none other burden" than the sufferings in which they exhibit the "patience" for which they are praised (ver. 19). This gives a very poor meaning, and, moreover, breaks the connexion with what follows: they are certainly not told to hold fast their sufferings, but Christ's precepts as to faith and conduct.

Smyrna and Philadelphia receive no blame; Sardis and Laodicea receive no praise. Sardis lies almost due south of Thyatira, on the road to Philadelphia, between the river Hermus and Mount Tmolus. It had been in turn Lydian, Persian, Greek, and Roman, and, like its last Lydian king, Croesus, had been celebrated for its wealth. The auriferous stream Pactolus, in summer almost dry, flowed through its marketplace; but its chief source of wealth was its trade. In A.D.  "twelve famous cities of Asia fell by an earthquake in the night...  The calamity fell most heavily on the people of Sardis, and it attracted to them the largest share of sympathy. The emperor [Tiberius] promised ten million sesterces (&pound;85,000), and remitted for five years all they paid to the exchequer" (Tac., 'Ann.,' 2:47). A little later Sardis was one of the cities of Asia which claimed the honour of erecting a temple in honour of Tiberius, but the preference was given to Smyrna ('Ann.,' 4:55, 56). Of the inscriptions which have been,discovered at Sardis, nearly all are of the Roman period. Cybele, or Cybebe, was the chief divinity of Sardis; but no reference to this nor to any of the special features of the city can be traced in the epistle. In the second century, Melito, Bishop of Sardis, held a very prominent place among Asiatic Christians, both in personal influence and in literary work. Among his numerous writings was one on the Apocalypse of St. John. The prosporous and luxurious capital of Lydia is now represented by a few huts and a collection of ruins buried deep in rubbish. It still retains its ancient name in the form <span class="accented">Sart.</span> The Church in Sardis has no Nicolaitans, no Balaam, no Jezebel. But there is worse evil than the presence of what is morally and doctrinally corrupt. The numbness of spiritual torpor and death is more hopeless than unwise toleration. The Church in Sardis, scarcely out of its infancy, has already the signs of an effete and moribund faith; and it is possible that this deadness was a result of the absence of internal enemies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath the seven Spirits of God</span> (see notes on Revelation 1:4, 16, 20; but observe that this designation of Christ does not occur in the opening vision). In <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a> the Lamb is seen "having seven horns and seven eyes, <span class="accented">which are the seven Spirits</span> of God." The seven Spirits being the Holy Spirit in his sevenfold activity, it is manifest (as Trench observes) that this passage is of importance in reference to the doctrine of the double procession. The Son hath the Spirit, not as One who receives it from the Father, but as One who can impart it to men. As man he received it; as God he gives it. And a Church sunk in spiritual deadness specially needs such a gift. Hence the repetition about having the seven stars, which appears also in the address to the Church in Ephesus (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>). Note, however, that here we have <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, which would not have been appropriate to express the Son's possession of the Spirit. It is he who holds in his hand the angels of the Church that also has the Spirit wherewith to quicken them. Those that are alive owe their life and growth to him. Those that are dying or dead may be restored to life by him. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead</span>. This, again, is thoroughly in the style of the Fourth Gospel. St. John frequently states some gracious fact, and in immediate sequence gives the very opposite of what might have been expected to result from it. "Thou hast a reputation for life, and (instead of being full of vigour and growth) thou art a corpse." This has been called "the tragic tone" in St. John (comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5, 10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11, 19, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-36.htm">John 6:36, 43</a>, etc.). In all these cases the contrast is introduced by a simple <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, which may be rendered "and yet;" but the simple "and" is more forcible. Beware of the unworthy literalism which suggests that the Bishop of Sardis bore a name which implied life, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Zosimus, or Vitalis. As already stated (notes on Revelation 1:20), it is improbable that "the angel" means the bishop. And in any case "name" is here used in the common sense of character or reputation. Comp. Herod., 7:138, where the historian says that Xerxes' expedition <span class="accented">had the name</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>) of being directed against Athens, but was really a menace to the whole of Greece. We have very similar uses of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="../../par/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>. The Church in Sardis had a name for Christianity, but there was no Christianity in it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-2.htm">Revelation 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be watchful</span>; literally, <span class="accented">become watching.</span> The use of <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> implies that the watchful state is not the normal one - a change is needed before the watching can come about (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9, 10, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, etc.). The use of the present participle instead of an adjective ("watching!" for "watchful") makes the charge more definite; not merely "be of a watchful character," but "become a watcher" (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stablish the things that remain, which were ready to die.</span> The reading, "were ready to die," is the best attested, and as being less smooth than "are ready to die," was more likely to be altered. It anticipates the time when the command will be obeyed: "which were ready to die when thou didst begin to stablish them." No doubt <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;</span> may be masculine in signification, and mean those members of the Church who have still some life in them. But this interpretation anticipates ver. 4, which apparently introduces a new fact. It seems better, therefore, to retain the neuter, and interpret "the things that remain" as meaning the few good elements of faith and practice which still survived. The externals of the Christian life were there; otherwise it could not have been even nominally Christian. And these externals might be made realities to support the revived life of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">For I have found no works of thine</span>. The difference between the Authorized Version and the Revised Version here depends upon the presence or absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>. The balance of probability is against <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, and its absence makes the reproach stronger. <span class="cmt_word">Fulfilled before my God</span>. The substitution of "fulfilled" (Revised Version) for "perfect" (Authorized Version) is important. The Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-13.htm">John 17:13</a>, etc.), not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>). And "fulfilled" is better than "complete" (Alford, Tregelles), in order to bring out the connexion with the numerous places in which the same verb occurs, especially in the writings of St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-8.htm">John 7:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11, 25</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a> 2John 12); in many of which passages "complete" would not stand as a rendering. "Fulfilled," or" made full," means made up to the right standard of excellence. The works of the Sardian Church have been weighed, and found wanting before God. "A minister of Christ is very often in highest honour with men for the performance of one half of his work, while God is regarding him with displeasure for the neglect of the other half." "Before <span class="accented">my</span> God" is undoubtedly the true reading, whatever may be the case in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>. Only in the writings of St. John does Jesus Christ speak of the Father as "my God;" and this fact is one more link between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. In this chapter we have five instances - here and ver. 12 (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a> [possibly] and <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). In <a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a> Christ adopts the language of <a href="../../par/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, and addresses the Father as" my God;" and St. Paul uses similar language (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>). The expression, "before God" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), is specially common in the Apocalypse and in the writings of St. Luke and of St. Paul; it does not occur in either St. Matthew or St. Mark.

They are of those "who, when they have heard the Word, straightway receive it with joy; and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while" (<a href="../../par/mark/4-16.htm">Mark 4:16, 17</a>). The "how," as is shown by the verbs "receive" and "hear," refers to the readiness with which they accepted the gospel, rather than to the power with which it was preached to them. The tenses are instructive: the aorist applies to the hearing at some definite period in their history; the perfect implies the permanent result of the act of reception. Keep and repent. Keep what thou didst hear. "Keep" is better than "hold fast," to mark the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3, 8, 10</a>, etc.), and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 13, 14, 15, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>, etc.). Here again the tenses should be noted: the present imperative indicates that they are to <span class="accented">continue</span> to keep; the aorist, that they are to repent <span class="accented">once for all.</span> We have a similar combination of tenses in" Take these things hence at once; continue to refrain from making my Father's house a house of merchandise" (<a href="../../par/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-34.htm">1 Corinthians 15:34</a>). "Remember" here and in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a> is with equal fitness the present imperative: "continue to remember." I will come as a thief. The "on thee" after "come," though well supported, is probably not genuine. Wherever this figure is used in the New Testament of the coming of Christ, the word used is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "a thief," and not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, a "robber" or "bandit." This shows, what is also plain from the context, that secrecy, not violence, is the point of the similitude (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>).

The verb is <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which implies acquisition of knowledge (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>).

The "but" (Revised Version) must be added, and the "even" (Authorized Version) omitted, on conclusive evidence.

Bode remarks, "He knoweth his own sheep by name, as he knew Moses by name, and writeth the names of his own in heaven." These few are like the few righteous in Sodom. Though they consent to abide in the Church, they do not leaven it, nor does their presence save it: "They shall deliver but their own souls by their righteousness" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 16, 18, 20</a>). The word for "defile" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here, <a href="../../par/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>.

In most cases all these three are rendered "defile" in our version. These few in Sardis have kept themselves "unspotted from the world" in which they live. Neither the corruption of heathendom nor the torpor of a moribund Church has infected them. Their contact with a dead body has imparted no life to the body and no defilement to them. There is no need to press the metaphor and give a special meaning to "garments" - whether their souls, or their bodies, or their consciences, or their baptismal robes. The metaphor is implied in "putting on the new man" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>), "putting on Christ" (<a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>), where the word for "put on" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to be clothed with." They shall walk with me. In accordance with Christ's high-priestly prayer (<a href="../../par/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>; comp. Roy. 21:24). In white. This elliptical expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) for "in white robes" occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="../../par/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>, and is another small link between the two books. The word "white" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), excepting in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-36.htm">Matthew 5:36</a> and <a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, is in the New Testament always used of <span class="accented">heavenly</span> purity and brightness. Thus also Plato, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;</span> ('Laws,' 956); and Virgil of the souls in the other world, "Omnibus his hives cinguntur tempora vitta" ('AEneid,' 6:665). (See notes on Revelation 1:14.) As we might expect, the word is specially frequent in Revelation. Of course, the white garments referred to here, vers. 5, 18, and <a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, are quite different from the undefiled garments just mentioned. The one is the imperfect purity of struggling saints on earth, the other the perfect purity of glorified saints in heaven. The promise, therefore, is threefold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They shall walk, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they shall have life and liberty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They shall have Christ as their constant Companion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> They shall be in unsullied glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And why? <span class="cmt_word">Because they are worthy</span>. The merit is not theirs, but Christ's, in whose blood they have washed their robes (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>), and by whose grace they are preserved in holiness (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>). It is because they have by God's help fulfilled the conditions which he has proraised to accept, that they are worthy. The nearest approach to this declaration of worthiness on the part of God's saints seems to be <a href="../../par/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a> (not 21:36) and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5, 11</a>. But in all these passages they are "accounted worthy" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) rather than "worthy" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). In <a href="../../par/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a> we have the opposite worthiness of those who have earned the "wages of sin" instead of the "gift of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Such persons are literally worthy, and not merely accounted worthy.

It is difficult to see on what principles of criticism Alford retains the reading of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of that rightly accepted by the Revisers, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. The latter has a very decided balance of external evidence in its favour; the former is a corruption very likely to occur either accidentally or in order to introduce a construction very frequent in St. John (<a href="../../par/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-18.htm">John 7:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_john/1-9.htm">2 John 1:9</a>). The change from "clothed" (Authorized Version) to "arrayed" (Revised Version) here and elsewhere is no doubt made in order to mark the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. But neither the Authorized Version (John 17:4; 19:8) nor the Revised Version (John 11:3; 15:6) is consistent. The Authorized Version generally renders both words "clothed." The Revised Version generally has "arrayed" for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and "clothed" for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Authorized Version is singularly capricious in having "garments" for <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 4, and "raiment" for the same word in ver. 5. The construction, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, occurs again in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, and once or twice in the LXX. (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>); the usual construction is with the accusative. The promise in this verse is again threefold, the last of the three promises in ver. 4 being repeated here as the first in this triplet. Repetitions of a similar kind are very frequent in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9, 16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will in no wise blot out his name</span>. The negative, as in vers. 3 and 12, is in the strongest form. Here we seem to have a figure borrowed from the custom of striking the names of the dead out of the list of citizens. But the figure is a very ancient one, as is seen from parallels in the Old Testament. The present passage, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> is singularly close to the LXX. of <a href="../../par/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; and to <a href="../../par/exodus/32-33.htm">Exodus 32:33</a>, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; and for the exact expression, "the book of life," see <a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; and (without articles) <a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, where Bishop Lightfoot comments as follows: "The 'book of life' in the figurative language of the Old Testament is the register of the covenant people (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>). Hence 'to be blotted out of the book of the living' means 'to forfeit the privileges of the theocracy, to be shut out from God's favour.' But the expression, though perhaps confined originally to temporal blessings, was in itself a witness to higher hopes; and in the Book of Daniel first it distinctly refers to a blessed immortality (comp. Hermas, 'Vis.,' 1:3; see also <a href="../../par/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a>)? And I will confess his name. Without the smallest manuscript authority or any encouragement from previous versions, Latin, German, or English, the Genevan and Authorized Versions here render <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> "but"! The simple connexion with "and" is thoroughly in St. John's style: "He shall be...  <span class="accented">and</span> I will...  <span class="accented">and</span> I will" (comp. vers. 12, 17; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26-28</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5, 10, 11, 14</a>, etc.).

"We may observe of this epistle that in great part it is woven together of sayings which the Lord had already uttered in the days during which he pitched his tent among men; he is now setting his seal from heaven upon his words uttered on earth" (Trench).

No satisfactory explanation of the change of arrangement seems to have been given by any commentater. The order in the four last epistles seems best. The exhortation forms a fitting conclusion to each, as in the synoptic Gospels to parables (see notes on Revelation 2:7, and comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-9.htm">Revelation 13:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-13.</span> - The <span class="accented">epistle to the Church at Philadelphia.</span> The circuit continues in the same direction. Philadelphia lies about thirty miles south-east of Sardis, on the road to Laodicea. It is said to owe its name to <span class="accented">Attalus</span> Philadelphus, King of Pergamum,  <span class="date">B.C. 159-138</span>. But it is by no means certain that he was the founder. A trustworthy tradition as to its <span class="accented">Egyptian</span> origin points to <span class="accented">Ptolemy</span> Philadelphus, who had estates in Asia Minor (Theocr., 17:88). Lying at the western edge of a district whose highly volcanic character earned it the name of Phrygia Catacecaumene, Philadelphia was constantly suffering from earthquakes (cf. ver. 12). It was destroyed along with Sardis in the catastrophe of A.D.  (Tac., 'Ann.,' 2:47). But the advantages of its position, commanding the way to the pass between the Hermus valley and the Maeander valley, and the richness of its vine produce (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:98), seem to have induced the inhabitants to cling to the site. The coins of Philadelphia often have the head either of Bacchus or a Bacchante on one side; and it is a known fact that volcanic soil is specially favourable to vine growing. Yet in Roman times it was not equal to Ephesus or even Laodicea; and for law courts its citizens had to go to Sardis. Nevertheless, it has outlived all these three, and still continues on the same site, and perhaps within the same walls, as of old. At the close of the fourteenth century it was the last Byzantine city to surrender to the Turks, and, when it did succumb, made better terms than any of the others. To this day it retains the privilege of free Christian worship, with the use of bells for service, and processions in public - a thing allowed by the Turks in no other inland city of Asia Minor. It has a bishop and a dozen churches, and it is said that about a third of its fifteen thousand inhabitants are Christian. Its modern Turkish name is <span class="accented">Allah Shehr</span>, "the city of God," or, as others write and render it, <span class="accented">Ala Shehr</span>, "the striped city." In any case the coincidence with "the name of the city of my God" (ver. 12) is purely accidental. (For an eloquent account of Philadelphia, see Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall,' Revelation 64.) It is doubtful whether there are any local allusions in the epistle; but some have fancied that "thou hast a little power" (ver. 8) and "a pillar in the temple" (ver. 12) are such (see notes in each place). The name of "Little Athens," which Philadelphia sometimes bore, on account of its numerous temples and festivals (<a href="../../par/acts/17-16.htm">Acts 17:16, 22</a>), shows that the little Christian community would have to contend with a specially vigorous form of heathenism. It had also to contend with a colony of hostile Jews, which was no doubt largely augmented after the destruction of Jerusalem, when fugitive Jews came to "worship before the feet" of the Philadelphian Church (ver. 9). Hence the epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians treats of Judaism as one of their chief dangers (c. 6, 8, 9.). There were men among them who questioned the authority of Gospels and Epistles, and admitted only the Old Testament Scriptures (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) as binding. Some had tried to lead even Ignatius himself astray (7.). Altogether his epistle gives a less happy picture of the Philadelphians than that which we have here, where (as in the epistle to the Church at Smyrna) the Philadelphian Church receives unmixed praise. Whether the large proportion of Old Testament language and imagery which is found in this epistle has any connexion with the Jewish colony in Philadelphia is uncertain. Perhaps most of the Christians had been originally Jews. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is holy, he that is true.</span> It is doubtful which of these two clauses should precede: authorities are somewhat evenly balanced. Christ, the Speaker, here claims to be "the Holy One" (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and therefore God (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). In the Old Testament "the Holy One" is a frequent name of God, especially in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-5.htm">Jeremiah 51:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>, etc. The word does not occur in Homer or Hesiod, nor in the Greek tragedians, but is very frequent in the LXX. and the New Testament. Its radical meaning is separation. The two epithets "holy" and "true" must not be merged in one as "the truly holy." The "True One" has a very distinct meaning of its own. Note that the adjective used is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">verax</span>, is "true" as opposed to "lying;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">verus</span>, is "true" as opposed to "spurious," "unreal," "imperfect." Christ is "the True One" as opposed to the false gods of the heathen; they are spurious gods. Both adjectives, and especially <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, are characteristic of St. John. The latter serves to bind together Gospel, Epistle, and Apocalypse. It occurs nine times in the Gospel, four times in the First Epistle, and ten times in the Apocalypse; twenty-three times in all; in the rest of the New Testament only five times. It is the word used of <span class="accented">"the</span> true Light" (<a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a> ); <span class="accented">"the</span> true Bread" (<a href="../../par/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32</a>), and "the true Vine" (<a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>). Applied to God, we find it in <a href="../../par/john/7-29.htm">John 7:29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>. He that hath the key of David. Observe that none of these titles come from the opening vision in <a href="../../par/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, although by no means all the material there found (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>) has been already used. The source of the present appellation is obviously <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20-22</a>; but it is worth noting that <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a> has much that is parallel to the unused material in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; so that the opening vision would seem to direct us, as this passage certainly does, to Eliakim as a type of Christ. As Trench observes, Isaiah foretells the promotion of Eliakim "with an emphasis and fulness" which would surprise us if we did not see in it not merely the description of <span class="accented">"a</span> revolution in the royal palace" of Judah, but <span class="accented">"the</span> type of something immeasurably greater." Shebna, whose name shows him to have been a foreigner, had misused his dignity and power as steward or controller of the royal house - an office analogous to that held by Joseph under Pharaoh and by our prime minister. For this he was degraded to the inferior office of royal scribe or secretary (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-3.htm">Isaiah 36:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-2.htm">Isaiah 37:2</a>), while Eliakim was made "mayor of the palace" in his room. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the LXX. and <span class="accented">praepositus templi</span> of the Vulgate would lead us to suppose that Eliakim's office was sacerdotal; but this is certainly a mistake. Luther's <span class="accented">Hofmeister is</span> much nearer the mark. A key would not be an appropriate symbol of a priestly office. In possessing "the key of the house of David," Eliakim had control over the house of David. Therefore in this passage Christ claims the control of that of which the house of David was a type. He is Regent in the kingdom of God. <span class="cmt_word">He that openeth, and none shall shut, and shutteth, and none openeth.</span> The various readings here are numerous, but not of much moment: "shall shut" is much better attested than "shutteth" in the first half "The keys of the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>) are not to be confounded with "the key of knowledge" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>). They belong to Christ, but have been committed to his Church, but not unreservedly. "He still retains the highest administration in his own hands" (Trench): and if the Church errs in binding or loosing, he cancels the judgment. The Church may open where Christ will shut, and shut where Christ will open. He alone openeth so that none shall strut, and shutteth so that none can open. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know thy works</span>. Once more Christ's judgment is based upon intimate personal knowledge. A question arises whether the next sentence, introduced by "behold," should be parenthetical or not. It is possible, as in the Authorized Version and previous English versions, and also in the Vulgate, to avoid what is certainly an awkward parenthesis. On the other hand, it seems clear that in ver. 1 and ver. 15 <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depends upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, "I know thy works, <span class="accented">that</span> thou," and does not introduce a fresh sentence; "I know thy works: <span class="accented">for</span> thou." Then must not <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depend upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> here? But either arrangement makes good sense, and perhaps the omission of the parenthesis makes the best sense: <span class="accented">"Because</span> thou hast little power, and hast made a good use of that little, I have given thee an opportunity of which none shall deprive thee." This seems to be the obvious meaning of the"opened door," in accordance with <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>. The Philadelphian Church, in spite of its small advantages, whether in numbers or prosperity, kept Christ's word when called upon to deny him; and for this it shall ever have the privilege of giving others an entrance into Christ's fold. The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, appear to point to some definite occasion. On "keep my word," see notes on Revelation 1:3 and Revelation 2:26. The antithetic parallelism, "didst keep and didst not deny," is thoroughly in St. John's style, and is one of many instances of the Hebrew cast of his language (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-5.htm">John 10:5, 18</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 10, 11, 27, 28</a>).

The Church of Smyrna was encouraged with a promise that their Jewish opponents should not be victorious over them. The Philadelphian Christians are told that they shall be victorious over their Jewish opponents. As before (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>), those who "say they are Jews, and they are not," are Jews who refuse to believe in the Messiah and reject the Gospel. The only true Jews are those who accept the Christ. They are not, but do lie. Antithetic parallelism, as in ver. 8 and <a href="../../par/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>. I will make them to come and worship at thy feet. This would be fulfilled when the destruction of Jerusalem drove large numbers of Jews into Asia Minor. Every city which had previously had a Jewish colony would then receive a great influx of refugees. This augmented Jewish settlement at Philadelphia was to furnish some converts to the Christian Church; but, as we learn from the epistles of Ignatius, these converts tainted the Church with a stubborn form of Judaistic error. Hence the need of the warning in ver. 11. Compare "The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>). Know that I have loved thee. The "I" is emphatic: "I will cause them to recoginize that in this you received a blessing manifestly Divine."

Compare "I know mine own, and mine own know me" (<a href="../../par/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>). "The word of my patience" may mean either the gospel, which everywhere teaches patience, or those sayings of Christ in which he specially inculcates this duty (<a href="../../par/luke/8-15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-19.htm">Luke 21:19</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>). In "I also will keep thee" the two pronouns are in emphatic contrast. From the hour of temptation. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>, where we have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>). It is not certain that the common explanation, that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> implies exemption from trial, while <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> implies preservation under trial, holds good. "Temptation" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) generally has no article in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>, etc.; comp. especially <a href="../../par/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>). Here it has the article, as if "the temptation" were to be of no ordinary kind. The word does not occur elsewhere in St. John's writings. In order to bring substantive and verb into harmony, the Revised Version renders <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> "trial," the word for "to try" being <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. "World" here is not the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the ordered universe" (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>), but the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "the inhabited earth" (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>).

The epistle of Ignatius shows that this warning was needed. Owing to the stubborn Judaism of some in the Philadelphian Church, the central truths of the gospel were in danger. Take thy crown. Not merely "take away" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c1;&#x1fc3;</span>) from thee (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>), but "receive" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x1fc3;</span>) for himself (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-40.htm">Matthew 5:40</a>).

But it <span class="accented">seems</span> much more likely that St. John is alluding to the Hebrew temple. In the temple. The <span class="accented">temple</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the shrine, the dwelling place of God, not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, the whole extent of the sacred buildings. The latter word occurs often in St. John's Gospel, but never in the Apocalypse. The <span class="accented">temple</span> in the Revelation is the abode of God, the sacred shrine into which all may be privileged to enter, both in this world and in the world to come. Of my God (see note on Revelation 3:2; 2:7). And he shall go no more out. "And out of it he shall in no wise go out more:" such is the full force of the Greek. The conqueror's period of probation will be over, and he shall be for ever free from the possibility of falling away. Trench quotes St. Augustine: "Quis non desideret illam civi-tatem, unde amicus non exit, quo inimicus non intrat?" And I will write upon him the name of my God (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, "His name shall be in their foreheads;" and <a href="../../par/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, "Those which have not the seal of God in their foreheads;" the former passage referring to the elect in heaven, the latter distinguishing Christians on earth from their heathen oppressors). In the passage under consideration the action is future; it does not refer to holy baptism, but to the sealing of the faithful upon their entrance into glory - a sealing which shall settle for ever, and make all things sure. "To write the name upon" anything is a common figurative expression in Hebrew to denote taking absolute possession of, and making completely one's own. Thus Joab fears that Rabbah may be called after his name, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> looked upon as his, if David should be absent at the capture of it (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/numbers/6-27.htm">Numbers 6:27</a>). The struggling Christian is encouraged by hearing that a time will come when he will without any doubt become God's own, incapable of being removed or claimed by other. In the rabbinical book, 'Bava Bathra,' 75. 2, it is noted that there are three applications of the name of God: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the just (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the Messiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A reference may be intended to the frontlet of the high priest, upon which was inscribed, "Holiness to the Lord" (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). The inscription is threefold: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the name of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the name of the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the name of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For God was the Christian maintaining his warfare; to the Church, the new Jerusalem, was he rendering this service; under Christ, as Captain, was the fight being accomplished. Again, the victorious Christian was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to belong completely to God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to possess the citizenship of the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to enter into the glory of Christ, which was the new name, that which he knew not yet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We can here trace an analogy to the baptismal formula. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The name of God the Father, whose we are made; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> God the Holy Ghost, whose indwelling guides and sustains his Church, the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> God the Son, by whose Name we shall enter glory. <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the city of my God</span>, which is <span class="cmt_word">new Jerusalem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the city</span>...  <span class="accented">new Jerusalem</span> (see Revised Version). In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a> the name given to the city Jerusalem is Jehovah Shammah, "the Lord is there;" and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> Jehovah Tsidkenu, "the Lord our Righteousness." Either of these <span class="accented">may</span> be meant; but, as Alford points out, the holy name itself has already been inscribed. In any case, the victorious one is to be openly acknowledged a citizen of the new Jerusalem. The old Jerusalem was destroyed, and her citizens scattered; but a new Jerusalem, of which the true Israelites are the citizens, should reunite the faithful. It is noticeable that without exception, throughout the Revelation, St. John uses the Hebraic form of the name <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;</span>, while in the Gospel <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> always occurs. He almost seems to distinguish thus between the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly - the home of the true Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Which cometh down out of heaven from my God</span>. "Which cometh down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), a grammatical anomaly (cf. ver. 11; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a> and Revelation 3:12). The name "new Jerusalem" is always coupled in the Revelation with the phrase, "coming down from heaven" (see <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>). The spirituality and holiness of the Church is thus set forth, since its being is wholly due to God, in its creation and sustenance. <span class="cmt_word">And I</span> will write upon him <span class="cmt_word">my new name</span>; <span class="accented">and mine own new name</span> (Revised Version). This is not any of the names given in the Revelation, but that referred to in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which no one knew except himself. The passage is a promise that when Christ makes us completely his own by writing his own new name on us, he will admit us into his full glory, which is at present incomprehensible to us. Such comprehension is one of the things <span class="accented">"which</span> shall be hereafter" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>), and which cannot now be known to us, <span class="accented">"for</span> now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>).

Of the condition of the Church in Philadelphia we know nothing from Holy Writ, except what is contained in the passage before us. But its comparative immunity from trouble and destruction, and its continued existence to the present day (see on vers. 7-13, "Philadelphia"), render it probable that the message of the apostle was not without some effect. Thus Gibbon writes: "In the loss of Ephesus the Christians deplored the fall of the first angel, the extinction of the first candlestick, of the Revelation; the desolation is complete; and the Temple of Diana or the Church of Mary will equally elude the search of the curious traveller. The circus and three stately theatres of Laodicea are now peopled with wolves and foxes; Sardis is reduced to a miserable village; the God of Mahomet, without a rival or a Son, is invoked in the mosques of Thyatira and Pergamos, and the populousness of Smyrna is supported by the foreign trade of the Franks and Armenians. Philadelphia alone has been saved by prophecy or courage" ('Decline and Fall,' c). 64. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-22.</span> - The <span class="accented">epistle to the Church in Laodicea.</span> Laodicea, on the Lycus, a tributary of the Maeander, lay some fifty miles to the south-east of Philadelphia. The modern Turkish name, <span class="accented">Eskihissar</span>, signifies "the old castle." It is situated on the western side of the valley of the Lycus, on the opposite slopes of which, some six or eight miles distant, were Hierapolis and Colossae, with which it is associated by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13, 16</a>). Named at first Diosopolis, after its tutelary deity, Zeus, it subsequently became Rheas, and finally received its name from Antiochus II., in honour of his wife, Laodice. There were several other cities of the same name, from which it was distinguished by the addition of the words, "on the Lycus." It was a wealthy city, its trade consisting chiefly in the preparation of woollen materials. It was advantageously situated, too, on the high road leading from Ephesus into the interior. Though, in common with the other cities of Asia Minor, visited by earthquakes, it quickly recovered; and it was the proud boast of the Laodiceans that, unlike Ephesus and Sardis, they required no extraneous assistance to enable them to regain their former prosperity. This fact undoubtedly explains the temptations to which the Laodiceans were liable, and the reference in ver. 16 to those who were neither cold nor hot, and that in ver. 17 to those who said they were rich and had need of nothing (see on vers. 16, 17). The Christian Church there may have been founded by Epaphras, through whom St. Paul probably learned of the existence of false doctrine there (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8</a> and Colossians 1:8), for the Epistle to the Colossians seems to be equally addressed to the Laodiceans (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>). The importance of this Church continued for some time, the celebrated Council of Laodicea being held there in A.D. , and a century later its bishop held a prominent position (Labbe, 4. p. 82, etc.). But its influence gradually waned, and the Turks pressed hardly upon it; so that at the present time it is little more than a heap of ruins. The warnings of the Apostles SS. Paul and John, if heeded at all for a time, were forgotten, and her candlestick was removed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And unto the angel</span>. Those expositors who understand "the angel" of a Church to signify its chief officer, may with some plausibility argue that at Laodicea it seems almost certain that this was Archippus. In his Epistle to Philemon, a wealthy convert of Colossae, St. Paul sends greeting to Archippus (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>). If Archippus were the son of philemon, he might very well have been Bishop of Laodicea at the time of St. John's message. Moreover, the son of a wealthy and influential Christian, though likely to have been selected as bishop in the neighbouring Church, may have lacked the zeal necessary for the thorough performance of his work; and would thus incur the marked rebuke of St. Paul, "Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it" (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>), which appears immediately after the mention of the Laodicean Church. The Apostolical Constitutions also assert that Archippus was first Bishop of Laodicea. Of the Church of the Laodiceans write; or, <span class="accented">of the Church in Laodicea</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). These things saith the Amen. The word "Amen" is here used as a proper name of our Lord; and this is the only instance of such an application. It signifies the "True One." It is a word much used in St. John's Gospel, where it appears repeated at the commencement of many discourses, "Verily, verily." In <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a> "the God of Amen" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>) is rendered in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; in the Authorized Version by "truth" (cf. the use of the English "very" as an adjective - "the <span class="accented">very</span> one," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="accented">real</span> or <span class="accented">true</span> one). The term is peculiarly well adapted to our Lord (who is the <span class="accented">Truth</span>, <a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), not only as a general name or title, but especially in connexion with this solemn announcement to the Laodiceans. There was great need of the truth being openly proclaimed by him who is the Truth to those who, though nominally Christians, were ensnared by the <span class="accented">deceitfulness of riches</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>), and were deceiving themselves in the attempt to make the best of both worlds by their lukewarm Christianity. It was the purpose of this epistle to draw aside the veil which was hiding the truth from their eyes, and to bring them to a realization of that most difficult of all knowledge - a knowledge of self. The faithful and true Witness - an amplification of "the Amen." The epithet "faithful" asserts the truthfulness of Christ's work as a Witness; "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) signifies "real and complete." He is <span class="accented">a faithful</span> Witness because his witness is true; and he is a true Witness because in him is the complete realization of all the qualifications which constitute any one really and truly a witness. "Faithful" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) has the passive meaning of "that which is worthy of faith," not the active meaning of "he who believes something." Trench well points out that God can only be <span class="accented">faithful in</span> the former sense; man may <span class="accented">be faithful</span> in beth senses. Christ was a Witness worthy of faith, since he possessed all the attributes of such a witness. He <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> had seen what he attested; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> was competent to relate and reproduce this information; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> was willing to do this faithfully and truly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Beginning of the creation of God. There are two ways in which these words might be understood: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that in which "beginning" is taken in a passive sense, and which would therefore make Christ the first created thing of all the things which God created; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the active sense, by which Christ is described as the Beginner, the Author, Moving Principle or Source of all the things which God created. That the latter meaning is the true one is plain from the whole tenor of Holy Scripture. The Ariaus, attempting to disprove the Divinity of our Lord, quoted this passage, attributing to it the former sense. But <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is often used actively, and may well be so used here - a view which is confirmed by the abundant evidence of our Lord's Divinity found elsewhere in the Bible, and nowhere more plainly asserted than in the writings of St. John. The self-reliant Laodiceans are thus directed to place their trust in him who is the Source of all things, rather than in those created things of which he is the Creator. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - I know thy works; and because they are not what they should be (vers. 16, 17), I give thee this admonition, which is nevertheless a warning and a token of my love (ver. 19). That thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. The lukewarmness of which the Epistle complains was produced by a fallacious sense of security, begotten of ease and prosperity. In truth those "secure," without care, had become the careless ones. Active opposition may well be a less deadly evil than careless ease. The persecution of a St. Paul may be diverted into the zeal of an apostle; but how can any active good be got from that which is utterly stagnant and without motive power? The man who, by wilful action, increases a disease, may repent of his deed, and try to recover from the danger to which he has exposed himself; but he who lives on in careless ignorance of the existence of the malady can never improve himself until he has awoke to a full knowledge of his own state. Some understand "cold" to mean "untouched by the power of grace," and "lukewarm" to denote those who, having received the grace of God, had not allowed it full scope in bringing forth works meet for repentance (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). And just as there was more hope of the real conversion of the "cold" publicans and harlots, who "went into heaven" (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-31.htm">Matthew 21:31</a>) before the self-satisfied, "lukewarm" Pharisees, so there is more hope of an unconverted sinner than of him who, having once been roused to a sense of God's will, has relapsed into a state of self satisfied indolence and carelessness. The sentence is <span class="accented">not</span> a wish that the Laodiceans should become hot or cold; it is a regret that they had not been one or the other. Our Lord is not wishing that any of them may become cold, but regretting that, when he comes to review their conduct and to pronounce judgment, many of them cannot even plead that they "knew not the way of righteousness," but belong to that worse class, "which after they had known it, turned from the holy commandment delivered unto them (<a href="../../par/2_peter/2-21.htm">2 Peter 2:21</a>; see also <a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>).

The distaste and nausea produced by lukewarm food, which the stomach naturally rejects with loathing, are used as a figure in which to express the abhorrence of Christ for those who lacked zeal in his service (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a> and Leviticus 20:22, "That the land spue not you out also"). But the sentence is not irrevocable; there is still hope of averting it: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I am about to spue thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if a timely repentance does not avert the impending doom.

The Epistle is still addressed indirectly to the Laodicean Church, directly to the angel. No doubt spiritual riches are immediately referred to; but spiritual pride and lukewarmness are frequently produced by worldly prosperity, such as that which Archippus (if he be the angel addressed; see on ver. 14) and the Church over which he presided enjoyed. It is not enough for the wealthy Christian to contribute a portion of his wealth, and then to consider his task done and his reward sure. Greater zeal than this is requisite before he can deem his duty discharged. Moreover, the greater the zeal that exists, the less will be the inclination to rely upon what has been accomplished, or to think it sufficient; for when all has been done we are still to call ourselves unprofitable servants (<a href="../../par/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>, "I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin"). <span class="cmt_word">And knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked</span>; <span class="accented">and knowest not that thou, even thou thyself, art the wretched one.</span> The self-satisfied spiritual pride of the Pharisee caused him to regard with complacent pity the condition of the publican. But he was mistaken; he himself was <span class="accented">the wretched one</span>, who was to be pitied. So with the Laodicean Church. How different the conduct of St. Paul, who recognized his own wretchedness (<a href="../../par/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>, where the same word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used)! The following words are adjectives. These Christians, in their spiritual pride, were <span class="accented">miserable -</span> deserving of pity; <span class="accented">poor</span> in the wealth accumulated by zeal in God's service; <span class="accented">blind</span> as to their real condition and their fancied spiritual safety; and <span class="accented">naked</span> of the cloak with which charity - fervent love of God - would have covered them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <i>that</i> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich;</span> <span class="accented">gold refined by the fire</span> (Revised Version). It is doubtful whether ver. 17 should be connected with ver. 18 or with ver. 16 - whether the self-satisfied condition of the Church is given as the reason why "I will spue thee out of my mouth," or as the reason why "I counsel thee to buy of me." The Revised Version follows the Authorized Version in connecting yore. 17 and 18; and this view is supported by Alford, Bengel, Dusterdieck, Ebrard. But Trench prefers the other view. The Authorized Version seems correct, for the reason why "I will spue thee" is given in ver. 16, and another separate reason would probably (though not certainly) not be added. Though St. Paul (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>) had pointed out to the Laodiceans (see on the epistle generally, vers. 14-22; and el. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>) where "are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," they had not heeded the lesson, and now Christ once more counsels them to obtain true riches from the proper source. They are to buy <span class="accented">from me</span>; the emphasis being laid on <span class="accented">me</span>, in contradistinction to their trust in themselves. They are <span class="accented">poor</span> (ver. 17), and must therefore obtain <span class="accented">gold refined by the fire -</span> gold superior to that on the possession of which they so prided themselves, that they may indeed <span class="accented">be rich. To buy</span> this gold by giving something of equal value in exchange, they were truly unable. Yet it was to be bought, and would entail the sacrifice of something which, though perhaps dear to them, would be nothing in comparison with the return they would obtain. Note the Revised Version rendering <span class="accented">may become rich</span>, repeating and enforcing the fact of their present destitution. <span class="cmt_word">And white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed</span>. Laodicea is said to have been famous for the raven blackness of the wool which was prepared and dyed there. This, perhaps, explains the point of the reproof contained in these words. "Notwithstanding thy trust in the excellence of the apparel for which thou aft famous, thou art yet naked (ver. 17), and needest clothing; that clothing can be obtained only from me, and is far superior to that of which thou boastest, since it is <span class="accented">white</span>, the emblem of all that is purest and best; not black, like your own, which is a type of darkness, the darkness of ignorance and sin. Mine is indeed the garment of righteousness, the marriage garment with which thou mayest enter the presence of thy King." <span class="cmt_word">And that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear</span>. The nakedness will certainly be made apparent at some time. If it be persistently overlooked or ignored now, it will be made more glaring in the future, when God turns upon it the brightness of his presence. In the Revised Version "appear" is even more emphatically rendered "be made manifest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). "Stripping," in the Bible, is commonly used to denote putting to shame: Hanun cut off the garments of David's servants (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>); the King of Assyria was to lead away the Egyptians naked and barefoot (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>; see also <a href="../../par/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>); while supplying with clothes, or an additional quantity of clothes, was intended to show honour: thus Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in vestures of fine linen (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>); Joseph gave Benjamin five changes of raiment (<a href="../../par/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; see also <a href="../../par/esther/6-9.htm">Esther 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-4.htm">Zechariah 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>). And anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. This is, of course, a reference in the "blindness" of ver. 17, of which the Laodiceans were ignorant. "Eyesalve" is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;</span>, perhaps so called because made up in the shape of a cake of bread - <span class="accented">collyra.</span> We cannot but think, in connexion with this passage, of the miracle of the healing of the blind man by the anointing of his eyes by our Lord - a miracle witnessed and related by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.). The subsequent incidents and discourse, too, forcibly illustrate the state of the Laodiceans, so much like that of the Pharisees, to whom were addressed the words, "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth" (see on ver. 15). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent</span>. <span class="accented">As many as.</span> Not one whom God loves escapes chastening; if he be not chastened, he is not a son (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-8.htm">Hebrews 12:8</a>), for "all have sinned, and come short." "<span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">love"</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>, I love dearly; not merely <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;</span>. <span class="accented">I rebuke</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>), to reprove, so as to convict of sin and turn to repentance; the work of the Holy Ghost, who should "convict the world of sin" (<a href="../../par/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>). This verse is a solace and encouragement for the Laodi-ceans. They were required to make the sacrifices demanded of them, not so much that they might be punished for their transgressions, but to prove themselves of the number of God's elect. The stern reproof administered was a pruning, which was an evidence of God's loving care for them; the final sentence, "Cut it down," had not yet gone forth. But though thus intended for encouragement rather than condemnation, yet it could not but contain implied reproach, however tender. No one can be exhorted to change his path and to seek that which is holy without being reminded that he is unholy and has wandered from the right way. Those in Laodicea who took this message to heart must needs think of their <span class="accented">unchastened life</span> - the life full of prosperity and self-satisfied security, into which so little <span class="accented">zeal</span> had been infused, in which so little need for <span class="accented">repentance</span> bad been felt. The Church, indeed, needed some of that chastening, that persecution, and hardship, which should arouse her from the perilous slumber of ease into which she had fallen, and call forth some zeal and self-sacrifice, the frequent and natural result of opposition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock</span>; <span class="accented">behold, I have stood</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">at the door, and am knocking</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>). "These gracious words declare the long-suffering of Christ, as he waits for the conversion of sinners (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>); and not alone the long-suffering which waits, but the love which seeks to bring that conversion about, which '<span class="accented">knocks</span>.' He at whose door we ought to stand, for he <span class="accented">is</span> the Door (<a href="../../par/john/10-7.htm">John 10:7</a>), who, as such, has bidden <span class="accented">us to knock</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-9.htm">Luke 11:9</a>), is content that the whole relation between him and us should be reversed, and instead of our standing at his door, condescends himself to stand at ours" (Trench). The view, that <span class="accented">stand at the door</span> signifies "to come quickly" (Dusterdieck), as in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3, 11</a>, is scarcely in accordance with the context, since the whole passage has changed from rebuke and menace to patient beseeching and loving exhortation. These words recall the frequent use by our Lord of this figure of <span class="accented">knocking</span>, and especially <a href="../../par/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35, 36</a>, "Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately." If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me (see the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/songs/5.htm">Song of Solomon 5</a>.). Christ <span class="accented">knocks</span> and <span class="accented">speaks.</span> A distinction has been drawn in the work of conversion, corresponding to these two actions. The <span class="accented">knocking</span> is likened to the more outward calls of sickness, trouble, etc., by which he makes his presence known; while the <span class="accented">voice</span>, which interprets the knock and informs us of the Personality of him who knocks, is the voice of the Holy Spirit, speaking to us, and explaining the meaning of our trials. Man's free will is here well and plainly set forth. Though the opening, to be effective, needs the help and presence of Christ, yet he does not forcibly effect an entrance; it is still within the power of man to disregard the knock, to refuse to hear the voice, to keep the door fast shut. <span class="accented">To take food</span> with any one is an outward sign of brotherly love and reconciliation. Christ <span class="accented">will sup</span> with those who do not drive him away, and they <span class="accented">will sup</span> with him. The whole figure is an image of the perfect nature of the sinner's reconciliation with God, and of the wonderful goodness and condescension of Christ. But we may well see an allusion to the Holy Communion, by which we are reconciled to God through Christ, and by which we may even now have a foretaste of the final supper of the Lamb, which shall eventually last for ever.

The climax of the promises made to the seven Churches (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5, 12</a>). There are two points to be noticed in this promise: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the position promised to the conqueror, "in my throne;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the two thrones mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Note the expression, "<span class="accented">in</span> my throne" (not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), which occurs nowhere else. The mother of St. James and St. John had requested for them a place on the right hand and the left of our Lord - the highest dignity which she could conceive. The twelve apostles are promised to sit on twelve thrones, to judge the tribes of Israel. But Christ offers a yet higher honour, viz. to sit in his throne; placing us in the closest relationship with himself, and exalting us to his own glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The throne promised is not that which Christ now occupies with his Father, but his own. Christ is now sitting on his Father's throne, mediating for his Church on earth, and waiting till his enemies be made his footstool (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). To that throne there is no admission for humanity, though Christ shares it in virtue of his Godhead. But when his enemies have been made his footstool, and death, the last enemy, is destroyed (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>), and the necessity for his mediation exists no longer, since the Church militant will have become the Church triumphant, rhea will be erected Christ's own throne, which glorified man may share in common with him who was man, and who has so exalted humanity as to render such a condition and such a position possible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/3-22.htm">Revelation 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches</span>. The seven messages were not merely separate admonitions addressed only to each particular Church, but all the epistles were meant for all the seven Churches, and, after them, for the universal Church. Each Church had an especial failing brought more emphatically before it; but still the seven warnings are one whole, for the edification of all. As it behoves the individual Christian to avoid and repent of all sin, and yet to fix his attention on the cure of some besetting sin to which he is peculiarly liable, so these messages, though intended to be read by all, and heeded by all, place vividly before each Church its besetting sin, which more particularly requires attention. And as the sins to be avoided are to be avoided by all, so the separate rewards arc promised to all who overcome. They are, therefore, not really distinct rewards, but rather different phases and views of one great whole, which shall be enjoyed in its entirety by those who have struggled victoriously with the trials and temptations of the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/4.htm"><title>Revelation 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/3.htm" title="Revelation 3">&#9668;</a> Revelation 4 <a href="../revelation/5.htm" title="Revelation 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">After this I looked, and, behold, a door <i>was</i> opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard <i>was</i> as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this</span>; or, <span class="accented">after these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). There is no good ground for supposing, as some do, that, after the events narrated in <a href="../../par/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>, an interval occurred in the visions, during which St. John possibly wrote down the matter contained in the first three chapters. Nor is there any justification for assigning what follows to a time after this world. It would be pressing <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> very far to make it apply to these present things of the world; and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> certainly need not mean "the things after this world." The expression is used here in its ordinary, natural sense: "After having seen this, I saw," etc.; introducing some new phase or variety of spectacle. <span class="cmt_word">I looked</span>; or, <span class="accented">I saw</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). No fresh act of <span class="accented">looking</span> is signified. <span class="accented">I saw in</span> the Spirit, as formerly (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, a door;</span> or, <span class="accented">and, behold, a door, and the first voice.</span> Such is the construction of the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">Was opened in heaven</span>; or, <span class="accented">an open door, in heaven.</span> St. John did not see the action of opening the door, but he saw a door which had been set open, through which he might gaze, and observe what passed within. Alford contrasts <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>, where "the heaven was opened;" and supposes that the seer is transported through the open door into heaven, from which position he sees heaven, and views all that happens on the earth. Victorinus aptly compares the <span class="accented">open door</span> to the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me</span>. Omit the "was" which follows, as well as the colon which precedes, and repeat "a voice," as in the Revised Version: <span class="accented">And, behold, an open door in heaven, and the first voice which 1 heard, the voice which was, as it were, of a trumpet.</span> The voice signified is not the <span class="accented">first</span>, but the <span class="accented">former</span> voice; viz. that already heard and described in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>. The possessor of the voice is not indicated. Stier ('Reden Jesu') attributes the voice to Christ; but it seems rather that of an angel, or at any rate not that of Christ, whose voice in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a> is described as "of many waters, "not as" of a trumpet." <span class="cmt_word">Which said</span>. The voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) becomes masculine (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). Though <span class="accented">whose</span> voice is not stated, yet the vividness and reality of the vision causes the writer to speak of the <span class="accented">voice</span> as the personal being whom it signifies. Come up hither. That is in the Spirit - for the apostle "immediately was in the Spirit" (ver. 2). He was to receive a yet higher insight into spiritual things (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, where St. Paul was "caught up into the third heaven"). <span class="cmt_word">And I will show thee</span>. It is not necessary, with Stier (see above on ver. 1), to infer that these words are Christ's. Though from him all the revelation comes, he may well use the ministry of angels through whom to signify his will. <span class="cmt_word">Things which must be hereafter</span>; or, <span class="accented">the things which must happen hereafter.</span> The things which it is right should happen, and which, therefore, must needs happen (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). "Hereafter" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); as before in ver. 1, but in a somewhat more general and less definite sense - at <span class="accented">some time after this</span>; but when precisely is not stated. The full stop may possibly be better placed before "hereafter;" in which case "hereafter" would introduce the following phrase, exactly as before in this verse. There is no "and;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, though in the Textus Receptus, is omitted in the best manuscripts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and <i>one</i> sat on the throne.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And immediately I was in the Spirit</span>. Omit "and" (see above), so that the passage may be rendered, <span class="accented">After these things, immediately, I was in the Spirit</span>; a new scene was opened out, as before (in ver. 1). St. John was already <span class="accented">in the Spirit</span>; but now receives a fresh outpouring of grace, enabling him to see yet more deeply into the mysteries of the kingdom of God.

There is no action of placing or setting up. Compare the vision of Ezekiel, "In the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>), where the throne appears above the cherubim, in the position of the cloud of glory (cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1, 2</a>, where the seraphim are above). <span class="cmt_word">And one sat on the throne.</span> Probably the Triune God, to whom the Trisagien in ver. 8 is addressed. Some have thought that the Father is indicated, in contradistinction to the other Persons of the Holy Trinity, and that it is from him that the Son takes the book in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>. But as Cornelius a Lapide remarks, "The Son as Man may well be said, especially in a sublime vision like this, to come to God." The Person is not named, because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Name of God is incommunicable; it is the "new Name" (see on Revelation 3:12); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because the seer describes only what is seen; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is suppressed from a sense of reverence.

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is found in this verse and in two other places only in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="../../par/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> (where it is part of a quotation from Joel) and in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>.

In the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is frequently used to signify either "vision" or "appearance" (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a> and Daniel 8:1; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>; and many others, where it is "vision." Also <a href="../../par/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 13, 26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>; and many others, where it is "appearance").

The <span class="accented">jasper</span> was the last, and the <span class="accented">sardius</span> the first stone of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>). The jasper was the first, and the sardius the sixth of the foundations of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19, 20</a>). Much doubt is attached to the whole subject of the precious stones of the Bible. The modern jasper is opaque, while it is evident that the jasper of the Revelation is remarkable for its translucent character (see <a href="../../par/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>, "jasper stone. clear as crystal;" 21:18, "The building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass"). It is evident that the stone was characterized by purity and brilliancy - features which seem to point it out as the modern diamond. The varying colour, which, according to some authorities, the jasper possessed, is not inconsistent with this view. It is curious, too, that in <a href="../../par/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>, the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, which in the Authorized Version is rendered "diamond," is represented in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; while in ver. 20, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> the English "jasper," is <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">sardius</span> was the carnelian, always red, though somewhat varying in shade. The name has been variously derived from <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Persian <span class="accented">sered</span>, yellowish red; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Sardis, as the first place of its discovery; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> while carnelian is connected with <span class="accented">carneus</span>, as being of the colour of raw flesh. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Skeat derives the word from <span class="accented">cornu</span>, a horn; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the term being thus an allusion to the semitransparent nature of the stone. The pure jasper, together with the red sardius, may fitly typify God's purity and mercy together with his justice and judgment. <span class="cmt_word">And there was a rainbow round about the throne.</span> The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ca;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is used here, is not found in the LXX.? where <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is invariably found, probably to avoid reference to a term which was so pre-eminently heathen. The rainbow is here, as always (see <a href="../../par/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12, 13</a>), a token of God's faithfulness in keeping his promises. It is, therefore, a fit sign of comfort to those persecuted Christians to whom, and for whose edification, this message was sent. In sight like unto an emerald. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is our modern green emerald. It was highly valued in Roman times. It was one of the stones of the high priest's breastplate, and the fourth foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>). The description in this verse recalls <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23</a>, "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain. so was the appearance of the brightness round about." Some have found a difficulty in the association of a rainbow with its varied colours, and the single green hue of the emerald. But of course it is the form only of the rainbow which is alluded to, not every quality which a rainbow may possess. A circular green appearance was seen round the throne, which perhaps may be described as a green halo. If the purity of the jasper (see above) be allowed to symbolize God's purity and spirituality, and the sardine, man clothed with flesh, the green emerald may fitly represent God's goodness displayed in nature.

The point is immaterial, as the meaning is the same. <span class="cmt_word">And upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting</span>. Omit "I saw" (see above). The number twenty-four, the double of twelve, represents the Churches of both the old and the new covenants. The elders are the heads or representatives of the body to which they belong (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-7.htm">Exodus 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>, and many others; see also the list of <span class="accented">elders</span> in <a href="../../par/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.). In the Christian Church the same distinction exists (see <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>, "ordained them <span class="accented">elders</span>;" <a href="../../par/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>, St. Paul sent for <span class="accented">the elders</span> of Ephesus; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>, "The elders were present"). So here the <span class="accented">elders</span> represent the saints of both the Old and New Testaments. Thus they offer "the prayers of the saints" (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). Christ, moreover, promised twelve thrones to his disciples (<a href="../../par/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>) though not to the exclusion of the saints of old, for both are conjoined in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14</a>.

(For this last view, for which there is much to be said, see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) Clothed in white raiment; the natural garb of heaven, symbolical of purify. And they had on their heads crowns of gold (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). The crown of victory, not necessarily the kingly crown. Possibly a reference to the priestly crown (see on Revelation 2:10). Trench and Vaughan, however, are of opinion that the crowns here denote the kingly condition of the saints. But Christians are nowhere in the New Testament described as "kings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and <i>there were</i> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thundering and voices.

"There were thunders and lightnings and...  the voice of the trumpet" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. The Holy Spirit, represented in his sevenfold operation, by lamps, which illumine. The same idea is expressed under another figure in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>, where the searching, enlightening power of the Holy Spirit is typified by <span class="accented">seven eyes.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And before the throne <i>there was</i> a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, <i>were</i> four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. <span class="accented">Sea of glass</span>, or <span class="accented">a glassy sea.</span> The quality of "glassiness" may refer to the pure <span class="accented">appearance</span> of the sea; or it may mean that the sea was in consistency like unto glass; that is, solid and unyielding, so that there was nothing strange in the fact that it supported weights. In either case, the notion is repeated by parallelism in the next clause, "like unto crystal." But the glassy sea may mean "a glass laver," and bear no reference to what is usually called a sea. The brazen laver is described (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>) as a "molten sea." St. John may therefore mean that before the throne of God was a laver of the purest material, just as the brazen laver was before the temple. One difficulty here presents itself, viz. that there would be no use for a laver in heaven, where all is pure, and the figure therefore appears a little incongruous. But as it stood <span class="accented">before</span> the throne, where all who came would have to pass by, it may fitly typify the waters of Baptism, passed by all Christians; and the figure would be aptly suggested to St. John by the furniture of the temple to which he has such constant allusions. <span class="cmt_word">And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne</span>. This may mean either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, the throne being rectangular, the four living beings were in the middle of each side of the parallelogram; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> while one was in front of the throne, the other three formed a semicircle round it, one being directly behind, and two towards the ends. <span class="cmt_word">Were four beasts;</span> <span class="accented">or, four living creatures</span> (Revised Version); or, better still, <span class="accented">four living beings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>). The "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="../../par/revelation/6-7.htm">Revelation 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, etc., must not be confounded with the "living ones" of this passage. The one quality connoted by the term here used is the possession of life. The question of the precise meaning and interpretation of the vision of "the living beings" is a difficult one, and much has been written concerning it. The vision is evidently connected with the appearances described in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10, and which are called in Isaiah "seraphim," in Ezekiel "cherubim." We are led, therefore, to inquire what mental ideas were pictured to the Jews under the symbolical forms of cherubim and seraphim. Cheyne shows ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 272) that the name <span class="accented">cherub</span> is probably connected with <span class="accented">kirubu</span>, the winged ox god of the Assyrians, and with <span class="accented">kurubu</span>, the vulture or eagle (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the guardians of the treasures of the gods); and he infers that among heathen nations the mythic cherubim denote the cloud-masses which appear to guard the portals of the sky, and on which the sun-god issues at break of day. With regard to the seraphim, he compares the name of the fiery serpents(<span class="accented">s'rafim</span>) of <a href="../../par/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, and concludes that the term was symbolical of the lightning, the weapon of the gods. Now, in Old Testament passages the cherubim and seraphim are always pictured as the attendants of God, and the workers of his purposes and judgments - an idea which may readily have been assimilated by the Jews from the conceptions of their heathen neighbours. Thus cherubim with the flaming sword are placed at the entrance of the garden of Eden (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); Jehovah rode upon a cherub, and did fly (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>); he communes with his people from between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>); he is the Shepherd of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>); the temple in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> is adorned with cherubim, as being the dwelling-place of God; they are the attendants of the glory of God in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22-28</a>; and the seraphim fill an analogous position (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). We may therefore infer that the appearance of the "living beings" implied the presence of some order of beings in attendance upon God, the workers of his will, and the manifestation of his glory. Again, the term used (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>) and the characteristics of the appearance naturally and almost irresistibly lead us to interpret the form as one symbolical of <span class="accented">life.</span> The human face, the ox as the representative of domestic, and the lion of wild animals, and the eagle among birds, appear to be typical of the four most conspicuous orders of animal life. The ceaseless movements described in ver. 8 portray the same idea. The four living beings draw attention to the woes heaped upon created life (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). The <span class="accented">eyes</span> denote never-resting activity. We may therefore believe that the living beings are symbolical of all creation fulfilling its proper office - waiting upon God, fulfilling his will, and setting forth his glory. It is noteworthy that the human face, as distinct from the Church, which is represented by the four and twenty elders, appears to indicate the power of God to use, for his purposes and his glory, that part of mankind which has not been received into the Church - the part which constitutes the "other sheep, not of this fold" (<a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). These representatives of created life worship God, and give (ver. 11), as a reason for ascribing glory and honour to him, the circumstance that "thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created." The following are other interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The living beings represent the four Gospels. This view is held by many ancient writers, though there are many variations in assigning to each Gospel its own representative. Victorinus considers the <span class="accented">man</span> to be a type of St. Matthew, who sets forth prominently the human nature of our Lord; the kingly <span class="accented">lion</span> is referred to St. Mark; the sacrificial ox to St. Luke; the aspiring <span class="accented">eagle</span> to St. John. Amongst the supporters of this interpretation (though varying in the precise applicability) are St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Athanasius, St. Irenaeus, St. Gregory, St. Ambrose, Andreas, Primasius, Bede, I. Williams, Wordsworth (for a lull exposition of this view, see <span class="accented">Wordsworth, in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The four great apostles: St. Peter, the lion; James the brother of the Lord, the ox; St. Matthew, the man; St. Paul, the eagle (Grotius). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Church of the New Testament; as the Church of the Old Testament was represented by the standards or four tribes (see <a href="../../par/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.), on which these devices were emblazoned according to tradition (Mede). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The four patriarchal Churches: the <span class="accented">man</span>, Alexandria, famed for learning; <span class="accented">the lion</span>, Jerusalem, <span class="accented">"propter</span> constantiam" (<a href="../../par/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>); the <span class="accented">ox</span>, Antioch, as "parata obedire mandatis apostolorum;" the <span class="accented">eagle</span>, Constantinople, remarkable for men "per contemplationem elevati, ut Grog.

These actions appear to indicate reverence, humility, obedience. The eyes denote ceaseless activity. And they rest not day and night, saying. In the Authorized Version "day and night" is attached to "rest not." but probably should be taken with "saying," for, if connected with the negative phrase, "nor" would be more likely to occur than "and." But the point is practically immaterial, since the sense of the passage is the same in both readings.

They have no part in anything which savours of death - no stillness, rest, or sleep. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy.</span> The thrice-repeated "holy" has very generally been held to indicate the Trinity of the Godhead.

The former, as Bishop Pearson says, embraces the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which was, and is, and is to come.</span> This phrase is no doubt intended to attribute to God the quality of eternal existence. But it may also symbolize three aspects or departments of God's dealings with mankind: the <span class="accented">creation</span>, which has been effected by the Father; the <span class="accented">redemption</span>, which is now occurring by the intercession of the Son; and the final perfect <span class="accented">sanctification</span> by the Holy Ghost.

For thou hast created all things; or, <span class="accented">for thou didst create all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">- the universe.</span> The representatives of creation thank God for their existence; the Church sees in his creation reason to ascribe power to him. Thus the reason for the doxology is given - "because thou didst create." And for thy pleasure; much better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and because of thy will</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). When God willed it, the universe had no existence; again, when he willed it, the universe came into being. <span class="cmt_word">They are, and were created</span>; or, <span class="accented">they were, and were created</span> (Revised Version). There are three variations in the reading of this passage: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> al40 fere Vulgate, Coptic, Syriac, Arethas, Primasius (in another version), anon-Augustine, Haymo; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;</span> is read in S, P, 1, 7, 35, 49, 79, 87, 91, <span class="accented">et al.</span> et Andreas; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is read in B, 14, 38, 51. "They were" signifies "they existed," whereas before they were not in existence; "and were created" points to the manner of coming into existence and the Person to whom this existence was due. If <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;</span> be read, the meaning is the same. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> would simplify the sentence very much. It would then run: <span class="accented">For thy pleasure</span>, or, <span class="accented">At thy will they were not existent, and again, at thy will they were created.</span> But the weight of authority is against this reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/5.htm"><title>Revelation 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/4.htm" title="Revelation 4">&#9668;</a> Revelation 5 <a href="../revelation/6.htm" title="Revelation 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw.</span> As in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, this phrase introduces a new incident in the vision. That which had been witnessed remained, but a further development now takes place. <a href="../../par/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. relates the revelation of the glory of the Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2) surrounded by his Church and creation. The glory of Jesus Christ, the Lamb, is now set forth, since he is the only One worthy to receive and declare to his Church the mystery contained in the sealed book. <span class="cmt_word">In the right hand</span>; <span class="accented">upon the right hand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>). That is, lying upon the hand, as it was extended in the act of offering the book to any one who should be able to open and read it. <span class="cmt_word">Of him that sat on the throne</span>. The Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). <span class="cmt_word">A book written within and on the back side</span>. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9, 10</a> the "roll of a book" is "written within and without;" another of the numerous traces in the Revelation of the influence of the writings of this prophet upon the writer of the Apocalypse, though the picture of the Lamb, which follows in this chapter, imparts a new feature peculiar to St. John's vision. The roll was inscribed on both sides. Mention is made of such a roll by Pliny, JuVenal, Lucian, Martial, though Grotius connects <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "on the back," with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "sealed," thus rendering, "written within and sealed on the back." The fulness of the book, and the guard of <span class="accented">seven</span> seals which are opened in succession, denote completeness of revelation (on the number <span class="accented">seven</span> as denoting full completion, see on Revelation 1:4). This book contained the whole of "the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>). It is noteworthy that - so far as we can gather from the Revelation - the book is never read. The breaking of each seal is accompanied by its own peculiar phenomena, which appear to indicate the nature of the contents. And the opening of the seventh seal especially is attended by a compound series of events; but nowhere are we explicitly informed of the contents of the book. Alford well remarks, "Not its contents, but the gradual steps of access to it, are represented by these visions." This view seems to be held also by Schleiermacher. Dusterdieck considers that the roll is never read, though the incidents attending the opening of each seal portray a portion of the contents. Wordsworth and Elliott understand that, as each seal is broken, a part of the roll is unrolled and its contents rendered visible; and these contents are symbolically set forth by the events which then take place. According to this view, the whole is a prophecy extending to the end of the world. The popular idea is that the roll was sealed along the edge with seven seals, all visible at the same time. If, as each seal was broken, a portion of the roll could be unfolded, of course only one seal - the outermost - could be visible. This is not, however, inconsistent with St. John's assertion that there were <span class="accented">seven</span> seals - a fact which he might state from his knowledge gained by witnessing the opening of the seven in succession. The truth seems to lie midway between these views. We must remember that the Revelation was vouchsafed to the Church as an encouragement to her members to persevere under much suffering and tribulation, and as a support to their faith, lest they should succumb to the temptation of despair, and, unable to fathom the eternal purposes of God, should doubt his truth or his ability to aid them. But we are nowhere led to believe that it was the intention of God to reveal <span class="accented">all</span> things to man, even under the cloak of symbolism or allegory. There is much which must necessarily be withheld until after the end of all earthly things; and, just as no mortal can possibly know the "new name" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>), so no one on earth can receive perfect knowledge of the "mysteries of the kingdom of heaven," which were symbolically contained in the book, and which, through the intervention of the Lamb, may one day be published; though a portion - sufficient for the time - was shadowed forth, at the opening of the seals; which portion, indeed, could never have been given to us except through the Lamb. We understand, therefore, that the book is symbolical of the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the mysteries of God; that, as a whole, the contents of the book are not, nor indeed can be, revealed to us while on earth; but that some small but sufficient portion of these mysteries are made known to us by the power of Christ, who will eventually make all things clear hereafter, when we shall know even as we are known (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). The events attending the opening of the seals are therefore a prophecy of the relations of the Church and the world to the end of time. Many opinions have been held as to the antitype of the book. Victorinus thinks it to be the Old Testament, the meaning of which Christ was the first to unlock. And Bede and others consider that the writing within signified the New Testament, and that on the back, the Old. Todd and De Burgh think the roll denotes the office of our Lord, by virtue of which he will judge the world. <span class="cmt_word">Sealed with seven seals</span>; <span class="accented">sealed down with seven seals</span>; <span class="accented">close sealed</span> (Revised Version).

One of the elders, as representing the Church (see on Revelation 4:4), bids St. John to take heed to him who was about to disclose to some extent the future of that Church. There is, of course, no indication that any particular individual is signified, though some have striven to identify the elder. Thus De Lyra mentions St. Peter, who was already martyred; others, referred to by De Lyra, say St. Matthew, who, in his Gospel, declares Christ's power (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda. The title is accorded to Christ, in illustration of the following act. The Representative of the royal and victorious tribe of Judah was he who had prevailed to open the book, where others had failed (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/40-9.htm">Genesis 40:9</a>, "Judah is a lion's whelp;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>, "For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah"). <span class="cmt_word">The Root of David</span>. The Root of David is a synonym for <span class="accented">Stem</span> or <span class="accented">Branch</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, "There shall come forth a Rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots;" and <a href="../../par/romans/15-12.htm">Romans 15:12</a>, "Esaias saith, There shall be a Root of Jesse"). Further, Christ may be said to have been the Root of David, by virtue of his pre-existence and his creative power. It is one of the paradoxes of the Incarnation, that he who is the Root of David should also be a Branch. <span class="cmt_word">Hath prevailed to open the book</span>; <span class="accented">hath conquered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). Not, as the Authorized Version appears to read, that the act of victory consisted in the opening of the book, but the ability to open was a consequence of a former act of victory, viz. the redemption. So in ver. 9 the ascription of praise runs, "Thou art worthy <span class="accented">because</span> thou wast slain" (on the infinitive epexegetic, see Winer).

For a description of the position of the throne and the living beings and the elders, see <a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. The passage would, perhaps, be more plainly rendered, "Between the throne and the four living creatures on the one hand, and the elders on the other, stood," etc. The repetition of "in the midst" is a Hebraism (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4, 6, 7</a>, LXX.). The Lamb would thus occupy a central position, where he would be visible to all. Stood a Lamb. The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is here employed, and which is constantly used throughout the Apocalypse, occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>. The <span class="accented">Lamb</span> of <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. This word has therefore been brought forward as an evidence that the writer of the Gospel was not also the writer of the Apocalypse, since, when the word is applied as a title of our Lord, the term differs. But the passage <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> is a quotation from Isaiah, and the writer naturally adheres to the form found in the LXX. version in that place. But on other occasions, when he is free to employ his own diction, as in <a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a> and in the Apocalypse, he invariably employs the term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Some have found in the fact that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">avalon</span>) is originally a diminutive form of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">amnos</span>), a reference to, the lowliness and meekness of our Lord; and they see a contrast in the <span class="accented">power</span> indicated by the seven horns. But such interpretations, however helpful and suggestive, are not warranted by anything in the grammar of the word; since, although no doubt originally a diminutive, the word had lost all such force in St. John's time; so much so, that the varying cases were formed from both words. As it had been Main. We are here confronted with what Stuart calls an "aesthetical difficulty." How could the Lamb, which was alive, standing, and active, exhibit any appearance which would give St. John the idea that it had been slain? Similarly, in the following verses, how could the Lamb <span class="accented">take</span> the book, or the four living beings handle harps and bowls, or the elders play on harps while also holding bowls? In the first place, it is perfectly immaterial to inquire. St. John is not giving a circumstantial narrative of certain historical facts which occurred in the material, sensible world; but he is reproducing ideas conveyed to him in some way (certainly not through the senses), which ideas are symbolical of events occurring in the natural and spiritual worlds, and of the condition of men or bodies of men. Therefore, if we can ascertain what these mental pictures are intended to portray to us, it matters not in what way the ideas were conveyed to the mind of the seer. In the second place, it must be remembered that the whole is a vision; and that although St. John says, "I saw," in point of fact none of the mental impressions which he obtained were conveyed through the senses. Just as a person relating a dream says, "I saw," when in reality his eyes had been shut and his senses asleep, so the writer here says, "I saw;" and just as in a dream we receive distinct ideas concerning an object without knowing how or why we know the particular fact, and that, too, when such qualities seem contradictory to others with which the object is invested, and yet no incongruity is apparent to us, so St. John realized that these objects possessed qualities which, in the sensible world, would have been impossible. Having seven horns. Throughout the Bible an emblem of power. Moses blessed the tribe of Joseph in the words, "His horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>). Hannah sang, "Mine horn is exalted" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). The <span class="accented">seven</span> denotes perfection (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). The symbol, therefore, attributes to the Lamb complete power (cf. the words of Christ in <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth"). <span class="cmt_word">And seven eyes.</span> The seven eyes symbolize perfect knowledge - omniscience (cf. <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, "They shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth;" and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him"). <span class="cmt_word">Which are the seven Spirits of God.</span> "Which" refers to the <span class="accented">seven eyes</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, "The seven Spirits which are before his throne;" and <a href="../../par/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>, "He that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars;" and <a href="../../par/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>, "Seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God"). The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, with his sevenfold gifts, is indicated by these symbols of illumination. For he illuminates and makes brighter those in whom he dwells, and renders clearer to them those things outside themselves, and enables them more fully to appreciate the manifold wisdom of God.

The Son in his human capacity, as indicated by his sacrificial form of the Lamb, can take and reveal the mysteries of the eternal Godhead in which he, as God, has part. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four <i>and</i> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - And when he had taken the book. "Had taken" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>) is here aorist, not perfect, as in ver. 7. The text should probably read, <span class="accented">when he took the book</span>; that is to say, the adoration offered coincides in point of time with the act of taking the book. <span class="cmt_word">The four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb.</span> <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">four beasts as</span> representing animated creation; the <span class="accented">four and twenty elders as</span> representative of the Church (see on Revelation 4:4, 6). <span class="cmt_word">Having every one of them harps.</span> (On the difficulty of <span class="accented">how</span> each one could hold harps and bowls, see on ver. 6.) It is possible that the phrase refers only to the elders; for these seem more suitably employed in offering <span class="accented">the prayers of the saints</span> than the representatives of all creation. If, however, as Wordsworth considers, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders together symbolize the Church, the phrase would apply to both. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16, 23</a> (the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of this passage) was played with the hand, and the instrument indicated was probably more of the nature of a guitar than the modern harp. <span class="cmt_word">And golden vials full of odours</span>. The Revised Version "bowls" is better than "vials." The idea is, no doubt, taken from the shallow bowls which were placed upon the golden altar (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>), and in which incense was burned. The <span class="accented">odours</span> are the <span class="accented">incense. In</span> the same chapter of Exodus directions are given concerning the preparation and use of the incense, which was always a symbol of prayer, and always offered to God alone (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense;" also <a href="../../par/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are the prayers of saints.</span> <span class="accented">The saints</span>; that is, the members of the Church of God. Some authorities consider "vials" the antecedent of" which;" but it seems best to refer "which" to "odours," though the sense is not materially different, since the former includes the latter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they sung a new song, saying</span>. <span class="accented">They sing</span>; the worship is unceasing. The song is <span class="accented">new</span> because it is only now, subsequent to the accomplishment of Christ's work of redemption, that the song can be sung. It is not" Thou art worthy, for thou <span class="accented">wilt redeem,"</span> but <span class="accented">"thou didst redeem."</span> Victorinus says, "It is the preaching of the Old Testament together with that of the New which enables the world to sing a new song." Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. (For a consideration of <span class="accented">the book</span>, and the opening of it, see on ver. 1.) For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood. The reason why Christ is worthy. <span class="accented">And didst redeem unto God by thy blood out of every kindred</span>, etc. Though the reading "us" is supported by various manuscripts, and similarly the first person is used in ver. 10. yet, on the whole, it seems better to omit it, the phrase being taken in a partitve sense - "Thou didst redeem unto God by thy blood <span class="accented">some</span> out of every kindred, etc., and hast made <span class="accented">them</span>, etc., and <span class="accented">they</span> shall reign." Again, "Thou didst purchase us <span class="accented">at the price of</span> thy blood" would, perhaps, give the sense more correctly; for such is the force of the words, "in thy blood" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). The words point to a particular act performed at a definite time, viz. the death of Christ, by which he repurchased men from sin and Satan for the service of God; the price of the purchase being the shedding of his own blood. The words show, too, that the fruits of the redemption are intended for the whole world; not limited to any chosen nation, though some are excluded by their own act. <span class="cmt_word">Out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation</span>. This fourfold classification continually recurs in the Revelation. It includes all the bases of classification of mankind, all the circumstances which separate men, the barriers which were overthrown by the redeeming work of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And hast made us unto our God kings and priests;</span> <span class="accented">and didst make them to be unto our God a kingdom and priests.</span> Of those whom thou didst redeem from every nation, thou didst make a kingdom and priests. Wordsworth remarks that these honours conferred upon the redeemed imply duties as well as privileges. They receive the princely honours conferred upon them only on condition that they also become priests, presenting themselves, their souls and bodies, a living sacrifice to God (<a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1, 2</a>), and, being a <span class="accented">holy</span> priesthood, offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). (On the person of "us," see on previous verse.) <span class="cmt_word">And we shall reign on the earth;</span> or, <span class="accented">and they reign on the earth</span> (see on ver. 9). The interpretation of this passage will necessarily be influenced to some extent by the view adopted of the millennium (see on Revelation 20.), Those who expect a personal reign of Christ on the earth for a thousand years naturally consider that in this verse reference is made to that period. And if the thousand years be understood to denote the time which elapses between the first and second comings of Christ, that is to say, the present time, the two passages - that in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a> and the one before us - may be connected, and intended to refer to the same time. We have, therefore, to inquire in what sense the word "reign" is used, and how the redeemed can be said to reign on the earth at the present time. In the first place, nothing is more plainly taught us than that Christ's reigning, his power, and his kingdom on earth are a spiritual reign, a spiritual power, a spiritual kingdom; though the Jews and our Lord's disciples themselves frequently erred by supposing that his kingdom would be a visible, worldly power. It seems natural, therefore, that if such is the meaning of Christ's reigning, that of his servants should be of the same nature; and we ought not to err in the same way as the Jews did, by expecting to see the redeemed exercise at any time visible authority over their fellowmen. The redeemed reign, then, spiritually. But it will be well to inquire more fully and exactly what we intend to signify by this expression. The word "reign" is not often used of Christians in the New Testament. In <a href="../../par/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17</a> we read, "Much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ." And in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-8.htm">1 Corinthians 4:8</a>. "And I would to God ye did reign." In both these places St. Paul seems to intend a reigning over self - an ability to subdue personal passions; a power which comes from the "abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness" which are mentioned, and which are possessed only by the redeemed, through Jesus Christ. This ability to subdue personal passions and ambitions is what the apostle wishes for the Corinthians, and of which many of them had shown themselves to be destitute, or only possessing in an inadequate degree. It is the truth which is expressed by Solomon in the words, "Better is he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>); and in the words of the Collect for Peace in the Morning Prayer of the Church of England, "Whose service is perfect freedom;" or, as it should be rendered, "Whom to serve is to reign." The representatives of the Church and of creation, then, adore the Lamb, through whose redeeming act grace may be given to men of every kindred and tongue, to enable them to overcome sin and Satan, and in the freedom of God's service to reign on earth as kings and conquerors over all unworthy passions. In this way, too, we account for the present tense of the verb, which is most probably the correct reading.

Thus the throne is in the vision seen as occupying the centre, the four living creatures are placed round it in different directions; the elders form the next circle, and the angels enclose the whole. The Lamb is in the midst before the throne (see on Revelation 4:6). "Thus," says Bisping, "the redeemed creation stands nearer to the throne of God than even the angels (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.</span> The readings vary here, though the sense of the passage is not affected.

It is because he had been slain and thus redeemed the world. <span class="cmt_word">To receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</span> The sevenfold nature of the adoration attributed to the Lamb is probably indicative of its complete and perfect nature. (On the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to receive," to take as a right what is offered, see Thayer-Grimm.) <span class="accented">Power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the ability to perform which is inherent in one's nature. <span class="accented">Strength</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>) is the attribute by which that power is put into operation; it frequently denotes physical strength. <span class="accented">Riches</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>, "And of his fulness have all we received;" also <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>, "The unsearchable riches of Christ;" also <a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, "Every good gift and every perfect gilt is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights;" also <a href="../../par/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>, "He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things "). The whole sevenfold ascription is spoken as one, only one article being prefixed. In this respect it differs from <a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>, where we have <span class="accented">"the</span> glory" and "<span class="accented">the</span> honour," etc. (see on Revelation 4:11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, <i>be</i> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them;</span> <span class="accented">and every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things that are in them</span> (Revised Version).

Those <span class="accented">under the earth</span> are probably the <span class="accented">"spirits</span> in prison" of <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>, though Vitringa understands the expression to be used of the devils <span class="accented">"who</span> unwillingly obey Christ," and even declare his glory, as in <a href="../../par/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>, "I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God." <span class="accented">The sea</span> is meant literally; the apostle's object being to include all animated beings wheresoever existing. It has been remarked that St. John's exile at Patmos would render him familiar with the appearance of the sea, and account for its frequent use in the Apocalypse, both literally and symbolically. The things on <span class="accented">the sea</span> would signify, not merely ships with their inhabitants, but also those animals in the sea which are known to men by dwelling near the surface. "All things that are in them" serves to render emphatic the universality of the description, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>, <span class="accented">"The</span> Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." <span class="cmt_word">Heard I saying.</span> "Saying" is masculine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in 10, 13, P, Vulgate, Andr. <span class="accented">a, c</span>, Arethas, Primasius.

The article, too, serves to give greater emphasis, making the expression tantamount to "all blessing," etc. (see on Revelation 4:11). Nothing is signified by the omission of three attributes. The number four is symbolical of the complete creation, and may be used on that account; but probably the omission is to avoid repetition, the four attributes given being typical of the seven just previously uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</span> That is, unto the Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). Christ, as having part with the Father and the Holy Ghost in the Godhead, sits upon the throne, and is worthy with them to receive adoration. But in his special character as the Redeemer, he is also singled out to receive the praises of the redeemed.

Three stages are marked in the hymn of adoration before this concluding verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the four living beings and the four and twenty elders worship the Lamb, and commemorate their redemption by him; they are able to sing "a new song" - the song of the redeemed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the angels join in the worship of the Lamb, ascribing to him the consummation of all perfection; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> then all created things praise God and the Lamb. In conclusion, the representatives of redeemed creation once more join in the eucharistic hymn, and prostrate themselves in worship before the Triune God.

The vision of the <span class="accented">seals</span>, which, although related first, exhibits events concurrent with those symbolized by the <span class="accented">trumpets</span> and <span class="accented">vials</span>, is contained chiefly in <a href="../../par/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>. <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a> is occupied with an account of an episodal character, similar to that which occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-11:14</a> after the sixth trumpet; and the vision is completed by the opening of the seventh seal, described in <a href="../../par/revelation/8-1.htm">Revelation 8:1</a>. The opening of the first seal pictures the triumph of Christ and his Church, for the comfort and hopeful assurance of those to whom St. John was writing, and for the edification of struggling Christians of all time.

The <span class="accented">thunder</span> is the usual accompaniment of a special revelation of the Divine will, and indicative of the majesty of him whose will is declared (see <a href="../../par/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a> and Revelation 14:2; also <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>). Nothing in the text warrants us in particularizing the four living creatures in these four invitations uttered by them, though many writers have endeavoured to do so. Thus, adopting the order in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, they have supposed that the first voice was uttered by the lion, since the revelation of the first seal is distinguished by the prophecy of victory. The sacrificial nature of the second living being  - the steer - is thought to be connected with the slaughter predicted under the second seal by the vision of war and persecution. The man is considered typical of the heresy which it is believed the third seal predicts, and especially of the false opinions concerning the Incarnation; while the eagle is regarded as a symbol of resurrection and the harbinger of the final victory of the just over the death and Hades of the fourth seal. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Come and see.</span> The Revised Version omits "and see." The Textus Receptus, without any apparent authority, reads <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>, "Come and see." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Come," simply, is read in A, C, P, fourteen cursives, several versions, two manuscripts of Andreas, etc.; while <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, "Come and behold," is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, thirty-four cursives, various versions (including the Coptic), two manuscripts of Andreas, etc.; and the Syriac omits <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Come." The authorities are thus very evenly balanced; but the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, even if not warranted, seems to indicate that the sentence was generally considered to be addressed to St. John; and was intended as an invitation to him to witness the appearances which accompanied the breaking of the seals. Alford contends that the cry, "Come," is addressed, on behalf of creation, to the Lord Jesus, and is a petition to him to speedily bring these things to pass, that his own advent may follow. In support of this, Alford remarks that there is no example of the use by St. John of <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the sense of "Come and see," "Come hither," without <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, or some qualifying particle; but, on the contrary, it is exactly the expression used of our Lord's advent in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17, 20</a>, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come," etc. Though there is much reason in this contention, yet, on the whole, the weight of evidence, as stated above, makes it probable that the sentence is addressed to St. John.

The <span class="accented">horse</span>, throughout the Old Testament, is emblematic of war. Among the Romans a <span class="accented">white horse</span> was the symbol of victory. <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat on him.</span> On a consideration of the whole of the visions attending the opening of the seals, it seems best to interpret this vision as a symbolic representation of the abstract idea of the Church as a victorious body. In a similar way the following appearances are typical of war, famine, and death. Some interpret the rider to mean Christ himself a sense not materially different from that given above, since by the victory of Christ the Church collectively and Christians individually are enabled to triumph; and in his body, the Church, Christ triumphs. This appearance is repeated, with additions, at <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>. The revelation thus begins and closes with an assurance of victory. God's end is attained in a mysterious way. Many trials and afflictions are to trouble the earth, but through all God is working to bring his Church triumphantly through the struggle. And what is true of the Church as a whole is true of each individual soul. Those to whom St. John wrote could not understand, as many now do not understand, for what purpose God permitted them to suffer. For such St. John's message is intended to be a support; not, indeed, by removing present troubles, but by declaring the final victory of those who endure to the end. Thus, then, as a preparation for the woes to be revealed, and as an encouragement after disclosing the prospect of prolonged trial, the vision of the Church triumphant is vouchsafed, both at the beginning and the end of the Revelation. Bisping and others understand the vision ass personification of war; Bengel and Reuss consider that it means conquest, or a particular conqueror (Vespasian and Trajan being denominated), just as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a> and Jeremiah 32:36 the King of Babylon is connected with war, famine, and pestilence. Elliott, with others, interpret the rider as meaning the Roman empire, just as the ram (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>) signified the Persian, and the goat (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5</a>) the Grecian empires. Todd sees in this appearance a particular aspect of Christ's second coming. Victorinus, following <a href="../../par/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a> in his exposition of the <span class="accented">seals</span>, sees in the first <span class="accented">seal</span> the Word of the Lord, which is like an arrow (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Andreas sees in the first <span class="accented">seal</span> a vision of the Church's triumph over Satan in apostolic times; and similarly, in the second, the martyrdom of Christians in the age immediately following. Bode believes the <span class="accented">seals</span> to foreshadow the future history of the Church. Wordsworth, after St. Augustine, expounds the first <span class="accented">seal</span> as the advent of Christ and the Gospel, and the following ones as depicting subsequent troubles of the Church, which are specified. <span class="cmt_word">Had a bow.</span> The <span class="accented">bow</span> and arrows are used as signs of power by Old Testament writers. In <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a> we have, "When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim;" in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8, 9</a>, "Thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation; thy bow was made quite naked;" in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>, "Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies." The general idea of the vision is perhaps taken from <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7-12</a> and 6. <span class="cmt_word">And a crown was given unto him,</span> In <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, quoted above, we have a parallel passage, "Make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the Man whose name is The Branch." The <span class="accented">crown</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> - the crown of life, the crown of victory. <span class="cmt_word">And he went forth conquering, and to conquer;</span> <span class="accented">came forth conquering, and that he may conquer.</span> This is the key to the whole vision. Only of Christ and his kingdom can it be said that it is to conquer. All earthly empires are more or less temporary in character; only of Christ's kingdom shall there be no end. A strife there must be between the powers of earth and the powers of heaven; the gospel did not inaugurate a reign of earthly peace, but the end is not doubtful; Christ and his Church <span class="accented">came forth conquering, and that</span> they <span class="accented">may conquer</span> finally, whatever earthly trials may intervene.

The tense is aorist. The circumstances described accompanied the act of opening, as in the case of the other seals. I heard the second beast say, Come and see; <span class="accented">I heard the second living being say, Come.</span> (On the four <span class="accented">living beings</span> as representing creation, see on Revelation 4:6.) For the omission of "and see," and the discussion of the question to whom the words are addressed, see above, on ver. 1. As there stated, some believe the second living being here specified to be the ox, which, on account of its sacrificial character invites the prophet to behold the result of the war which is personified by this vision. Wordsworth, interpreting the living beings to mean the Gospels, here sees a reference to St. Luke's Gospel, which depicts the sufferings of Christ, and considers that the ox here summons St. John to witness the persecution of the martyrs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">And there went out another horse <i>that was</i> red: and <i>power</i> was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there went out another horse that was red.</span> There is a very general agreement that the red horse signifies <span class="accented">war</span>  - slaughter by the sword which was given to "him that sat thereon." Slight variations of the application occur. Wordsworth, following the more ancient expositors, thinks that only that aspect of war is intended which consists in the persecution of the saints; while Alford and others would not restrict the meaning, but consider that war in general is meant, relying upon the following words, "that they should kill one another," and quoting our Lord's prophecy, "I came not to send peace, but a sword" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). Both views may be correct. Though there had never been persecution, war would be one of the great afflictions from which Christians in various ages suffer, and in which they need consolation; but we may well believe that St. John, in writing to Christians who were themselves being grievously persecuted, should refer especially to the slaughter of the saints, as one of the trials inflicted upon them with God's knowledge and permission. The Revelation, intended as a support to those to whom St. John wrote, and applying directly and specially to their situation, has vet a wider application, and foreshadows the fate of each individual Christian and the Church in general throughout all ages. And power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth; <span class="accented">and to him that sat upon him it was given him to take peace out of the earth.</span> The pronoun is redundant; it has no special signification (see <a href="../../par/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12, 21</a>). "The peace" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, peace in general, not <span class="accented">the peace</span> left by the first appearance. "Power" (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>). A few authorities omit <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, "out." "The earth" has been erroneously restricted to the Roman empire or to Judaea. The whole world is meant. Here is a repetition of our Lord's prophecy, "I came not to send peace, but a sword" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). The sword directed against the saints of God is, by God's providence, converted into an instrument for the refining and conversion of his kingdom. As in the death of Christ, Satan was foiled with his own weapon, and by death came life, so what is intended by the enemies of God to be the extermination of Christianity is the means of increasing and strengthening his Church. <span class="cmt_word">And that they should kill one another;</span> that is, that among the inhabitants of the earth some should kill others. As explained above, this includes both the slaughter of the saints and war in general. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "to sacrifice," is peculiar to St. John, being found only in the Revelation and in <a href="../../par/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>. The use of this verb seems to imply that the vision more immediately contemplates the death of the martyrs. <span class="cmt_word">And there was given unto him a great sword.</span> Here, again, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, though used also in a wider sense, signifies strictly the sacrificial knife, the natural instrument of the slaughter mentioned. It is the LXX. word used in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-6.htm">Genesis 22:6, 10</a>, in the account of the sacrifice of Isaac, where it is also closely connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "to sacrifice," the verb used in this passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-5.htm">Revelation 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had opened the third seal;</span> <span class="accented">when he opened</span>, as in the case of the other seals (see on ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">I heard the third beast say;</span> <span class="accented">the third living being saying.</span> (On the <span class="accented">living beings</span>, see <a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>.) Wordsworth takes the <span class="accented">third living being</span> to be that with the human face, and considers it to be typical of the whole vision of the third seal, by symbolizing the source of the next trial of the Church; namely, the rise of heresy, which he thinks is depicted by this appearance. But probably the four living beings represent all creation, and thus invite St. John to witness the troubles in store for mankind in general. (For a full consideration of this point, see on Revelation 4:6.) <span class="cmt_word">Come and see.</span> The majority of authorities emit "and see" (see the corresponding passage in vers. 1 and 3, where also is discussed the question as to whom the sentence is addressed). <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld, and lo a black horse.</span> The <span class="accented">black</span> is typical of woe and mourning - the result of the scarcity foretold in the following words. This vision is typical of famine; it is the second of the three trials foretold - war, famine, death (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14.htm">Ezekiel 14</a>, where the "four sore plagues" are wild beasts, the sword, famine, and pestilence). St. John seems to foretell the recurrence of three of these troubles to try mankind in general, and Christians in particular. Those who interpret the vision to mean scarcity of faith, or in other words the prevalence of heresy, do so on the supposition that the events denoted at the opening of the seals follow each other in historical order. They therefore assign these events to the period subsequent to A.D. , when persecution had ceased, and the rise of heresies took place. Others, accepting the historical view, yet consider the vision to foretell famine; and Grotius and Wetstein point to the famine in the reign of Claudius as the fulfilment. But it is not probable that the meaning of the book is so limited in extent; but rather that its prophecies point to events which have happened, and are recurring, and will continue to recur until the end of the world. We therefore understand that this vision denotes famine in the ordinary sense, as one of the trials awaiting the members of the Church of God at various times during the existence of the Church on earth. This affliction may happen concurrently with, or antecedent to, or subsequent to, any of those trials denoted by the other visions, and even the victorious career of the Church as foretold under the first seal; for by suffering the Church conquers and is made perfect. <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</span> <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is rightly rendered "a balance," as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-10.htm">Ezekiel 45:10</a>; not (as it primarily meant) a "yoke." The idea intended to be conveyed is that of scarcity so great that food is weighed carefully as something very rare and precious, though there is not yet a complete absence of food. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and <i>see</i> thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say;</span> <span class="accented">I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying</span> (Revised Version). The speaker is not perceived by St. John; the words proceed from somewhere near the throne (but the exact situation is left doubtful), which is surrounded by the four living creatures (see on Revelation 4:6 for the consideration both of the position and of the nature of the four living creatures). Alford points out the appropriateness of the voice proceeding from the midst of the representatives of creation, when the intent of the words is to mitigate the woes denounced against creation. Those who consider the living creatures to be symbolical of the Gospels, and who interpret this vision as a prophecy of heresy (see on ver. 5), also see an appropriateness in the fact of the voice issuing from amidst the living creatures, since by the power and influence of the Gospels heresy is dispelled. Wordsworth recalls the custom of placing the Gospels in the midst of the Synod in the ancient Councils of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny;</span> <span class="accented">a choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius.</span> The <span class="accented">choenix</span> appears to have been the food allotted to one man for a day; while the <span class="accented">denarius</span> was the pay of a soldier or of a common labourer for one day (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>, "He agreed with the labourers for a penny a day," and Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 1:17, 26, "Ut denarius diurnum stipendium foret." Cf. Tobit 5:14, where <span class="accented">drachma</span> is equivalent to <span class="accented">denarius</span>). The choenix was the eighth part of the modius, and a denarius would usually purchase a modius of wheat. The price given, therefore, denotes great scarcity, though not an entire absence of food, since a man's wages would barely suffice to obtain him food. Barley, which was the coarser food, was obtainable at one third of the price, which would allow a man to feed a family, though with difficulty. A season of great scarcity is therefore predicted, though in his wrath God remembers mercy (cf. the judgments threatened in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>, viz. the sword, pestilence, and famine; also the expression, "They shall deliver you your bread again by weight"). <span class="cmt_word">And see thou hurt net the oil and the wine.</span> The corollary to the preceding sentence, with the same signification. It expresses a limit set to the power of the rider on the black horse. These were typical articles of food (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14, 15</a>, "That he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart;" and <a href="../../par/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>, "The corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth"). Wordsworth interprets, "The prohibition to the rider, 'Hurt not thou the oil and the wine,' is a restraint on the evil design of the rider, who would injure the spiritual oil and wine, that is, the means of grace, which had been typified under those symbols in ancient prophecy (<a href="../../par/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4, 5</a>), and also by the words and acts of Christ, the good Samaritan, pouring in oil and wine into the wounds of the traveller, representing human nature, lying in the road." '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the Revelation invariably signifies "to injure," and, except in one case, takes the direct accusative after it (see <a href="../../par/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4, 10, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a>). Nevertheless, Heinrich and Elliott render, "Do not commit injustice in the matter of the oil and wine." Rinek renders, "waste not." The vision is a general prophecy of the future for all time (see on ver. 5); but many writers have striven to identify the fulfilment of the vision with some one particular famine. Grotius and Wetstein refer it to the scarcity in the days of Claudius; Renan, to that in the time of Nero; Bishop Newton, to the end of the second century. Those who interpret the vision as a forewarning of the spread of heresy, especially single out that of Arius.

This supports the view taken of the first three visions of the seals (see on ver. 2). <span class="accented">Hades</span> follows with <span class="accented">Death</span>, not as a separate infliction, but as the necessary complement of Death in the completion of the vision, swallowing up and guarding, as it were, those seized by the latter. <span class="accented">Death</span> is personified in a similar way in <a href="../../par/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, "Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;" and <span class="accented">Hades</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, "Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming." The two are also conjoined in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, "The keys of hell and of death;" and in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13, 14</a>, "Death and hell delivered up the dead." Hades cannot signify the place of torment, as Hengstenberg thinks, since these trials are to be inflicted on Christians, not on the wicked merely. Nor is it consonant with the context to suppose (as Ebrard) that <span class="accented">Hades</span> signifies "the dwellers in Hades." <span class="cmt_word">And power was given unto them.</span> The reading "them" is supported by A, C, [P], <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, n 17, 49 (1.40 e sil) Andreas; while B and the Vulgate read <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f7a;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "him." The context shows that both are intended. <span class="cmt_word">Over the fourth part of the earth.</span> There is a general consensus of opinion that this expression betokens a part of mankind. Why the <span class="accented">fourth</span> part is selected is difficult to say. Alford suggests that a reference is intended to the four first seals, each one of which embraces in its action a portion of mankind. But the first seal can hardly be interpreted in this way. Probably the intention is to denote that a part of mankind must be afflicted in this particular way, though no definite proportion is signified. In other words, the second, third, and fourth seals depict troubles which Christians and all mankind will have to undergo; some being afflicted more especially in one way, others in another. The troubles mentioned are not an exhaustive catalogue, but are typical of all sorrows; the selection being probably prompted by the Old Testament passages quoted below, viz. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>; and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>. "The fourth part" is an expression found only in this passage. Zullig agrees with Alford in the explanation given above; Hengstenberg, and somewhat similarly Volkmar, think it denotes the partial character of this judgment. Elliott, with very little reason, follows the Vulgate reading, "over the four parts of the earth;" Isaac Williams also thinks the judgment is universal, since that is the idea that the number <span class="accented">four</span> signifies, which, however, is a different thing from a <span class="accented">fourth part. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</span> The passage is another example of the influence of the prophecy of Ezekiel upon the composition of the Apocalypse. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> the "four sore judgments" are "the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence? This indicates the signification of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> in this place; viz. death by pestilence, not, as in the preceding passage, death in any form (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>, where the judgments threatened are the sword, <span class="accented">pestilence</span>, and famine. Cf. also the alternative punishments of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>); also 2 Esdras 15:5 <span class="bible_ref">4 Esdr. 15:5</span>, "the sword, and hunger, and death, and destruction"). The wild <span class="accented">beasts of the earth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is very probably a reference to the death of many Christians in the pagan amphitheatres; though the meaning is not necessarily restricted to this form of death. Those to whom the Apocalypse was first addressed would irresistibly be reminded of our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7, 13</a>, "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places...  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." It is as though St. John echoed the words of our Lord, "These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and would say, "I am commissioned to relate these visions of the present and future trials of all in the world, which, however, have been already foretold you by our blessed Lord himself." While, therefore, this passage may be understood literally, since doubtless the Church has suffered all these afflictions at different times, in different members of her body, yet we must understand these four typical judgments to be representative of trouble in all its forms; the fourfold character pointing to its universal nature (see on Revelation 5:9). This has led many writers to see in these inflictions trials of a spiritual nature - a view which may well be included in the proper application, but must not be pressed to the exclusion of any other more literal interpretation. We may thus sum up the results of our investigation of these eight verses. They relate the circumstances attending the opening of the first four seals, and doubtless typify various phases of the trials which are permitted by God to afflict Christians on earth in common with all mankind. Each of the four visions is preceded by the invitation of one of the four living beings, which are representative of creation; and a second feature common to these four visions is the appearance of a rider as the personification of the idea set forth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The visions open with a personification of <span class="accented">Christianity</span>, and an assurance of the ultimate victory which it will gain over the powers of the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Then appears a vision of <span class="accented">war</span>, as one of the typical troubles of mankind, which will ultimately be overcome by the triumph of Christianity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Next follows <span class="accented">famine</span> with all its attendant evils, though it is not permitted to extend to the extremity of the extirpation of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Fourthly comes death in every form - a trial of which every one feels the weight at some time. These four do not picture consecutive events; they may be successive or concurrent; the first is certainly being fulfilled side by side with the others. We may, therefore, be able to point to a particular period or event as a fulfilment of any one of these, but we cannot assign definite times to each as <span class="accented">the</span> complete and ultimate fulfilment, since the trials which are signified must extend to the end of time. <span class="accented">And</span>, in conclusion, while the first application was doubtless intended for the support of the Christians of St. John's age in their temporal difficulties, we must consider the visions equally intended to console Christians of every age, and even to portray the spiritual conflict, destitution, and apostasy which must and will continually arise while the Church remains in part in the world. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had opened the fifth seal;</span> <span class="accented">and when he opened</span>, as in vers. l, 3, 5, 7, which see. The second group of visions connected with the opening of the seals now commences. The first group deals with events more immediately attached to this life. By the visions of the first four seals St. John has shown that it is with God's knowledge and consent that afflictions and persecutions are allowed to try the faith of his servants on earth; while yet the ultimate triumph of those who endure is certain. In the last three appearances he goes a step further - he gives his readers a glimpse of events more immediately connected with the life in the world to come. He shows them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the faithful, resting from their labours, though longing, in sympathy with those left on earth, for the completion of Christ's triumph; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the circumstances attendant upon our Lord's final coming, which he describes in language which is almost a repetition of Christ's words on the same subject; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the inexplicable life with God in heaven, which is denoted by the silence following the opening of the last seal. I saw under the altar. This representation is doubtless suggested by the arrangements of the temple. Victims were sacrificed on the brazen altar which stood at the door of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a> and Exodus 40:29), and the blood was poured out at the foot of this altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>). The martyrs are therefore regarded as having offered themselves as sacrifices upon the altar of God by yielding up their lives for him. St. Paul uses a similar figure concerning himself. In <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a> he says, "For I am now ready to be offered ['to pour out as a libation,' <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;</span>], and the time of any departure is at hand;" and in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, "If I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith." Bleek and De Wette understand the golden altar of incense (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>), and consider that the figure is representative of the hearing of the martyrs' prayers. Bossuet says the altar is Christ. <span class="cmt_word">The souls of them that wore slain;</span> <span class="accented">them that had been slain.</span> An "aesthetical difficulty" (see on Revelation 4:6). How could St. John <span class="accented">see</span> the souls? Of course, he did not see them with his bodily vision, nor indeed did he thus see any part of the revelation. He "sees" them while "in the Spirit," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is somehow made conscious of the existence of the souls. <span class="accented">Slain</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "sacrificed;" the same word used of the Lamb in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>. The word is in harmony with the use of the word" altar," with which it is naturally connected. It fixes the signification of the altar, which therefore cannot bear the meaning ascribed by Block and De Wette, as mentioned above. St. John sees the <span class="accented">souls</span> only of the martyrs, since their bodies will not be reunited with their souls until the judgment day. Meanwhile, the <span class="accented">souls</span> rest (see ver. 11) in peace, yet in expectation of the final accomplishment of their perfect bliss, which the words used in ver. 10 show them to desire. Wordsworth quotes (as illustrating this passage) Tertullian, "The souls of martyrs repose in peace under the altar, and cherish a spirit of patience until others are admitted to fill up their communion of glow;" and Irenaeus, "The souls of the departed go to the place assigned them by God, and there abide until the resurrection, when they will be reunited to their bodies; and then the saints, both in soul and body, will come into the presence of God." <span class="cmt_word">For the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</span> B, Syriac, add, "and of the Lamb." <span class="accented">On account of the word</span>, etc. Exactly the same expression which St. John uses in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a> in describing the cause of his own exile at Patmos. The language is peculiarly St. John's (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>, "John: who bare record of the Word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw;" also <a href="../../par/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>, "The dragon...  went to make war with...  them which have the testimony of Jesus Christ;" also <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>, "I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.' The "Word of God" is of course <span class="accented">the truth which God has declared</span>, not <span class="accented">the Word</span> as in <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. "The testimony which they held" may differ slightly in signification in different places. It may mean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the testimony or truth which Christ has imparted to Christians; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the active showing forth of the Christian faith by word or deed. The latter is evidently the meaning here, since for this active manifestation of Christianity they whose souls St. John now sees in glory had been slain, which would not have occurred had they merely received the Word of God without showing it outwardly (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they cried with a loud voice, saying;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. the souls cried.</span> Ebrard, Dusterdieck, Hengstenberg, make "the slain" nominative, in contradistinction to the "souls," which is both <span class="accented">unnecessary</span> and unnatural. Zullig compares <a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." How long? (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12, 13</a>, "How long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem? And the Lord answered with good words and comfortable words"). No doubt the souls waiting in Paradise are answered by "comfortable words," yet, not having lost their interest in earthly struggles, nor their longing for the triumphant vindication of God's glory, they cry, "How long?," not as needing the time to be shortened for their own sakes, for <span class="accented">they rest</span>, though not yet entered into the fulness of God's glory. O Lord, holy and true; <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">Master, the holy and true</span> (Revised Version). "Master" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) is the correlative of "servant" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This is the only instance of its occurrence in the Apocalypse. (On "true," see previous passages.) Deal thou not judge and avenge our blood. The cry is not a petition for personal revenge, but a request for the termination of those ills which for a time afflict man, and the termination of which must, by virtue of God's eternal justice, be accompanied by visible retribution on the wicked. (Cf. Bede, "Those souls which offered themselves a living sacrifice to God pray eternally for his coming to judgment, not from any vindictive feeling against their enemies, but in a spirit of zeal and love for God's glory and justice, mid for the coming of that day when sin, which is rebellion against him, will be destroyed, and their own bodies will be raised. And so in that prayer wherein Christ teaches us to forgive our enemies, we are also taught to <span class="accented">say</span>, 'Thy kingdom come.'") The passage has given rise to varying interpretations, which are thought to be more consonant with the spirit of the gospel. Thus I. Williams would understand the souls to represent only the Old Testament saints, especially as it is not explicitly said that they died for the witness of Jesus, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>. On them that dwell on the earth. That is, on the worldly, those who have taken the side of the world in its conflict with Christianity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they <i>were</i>, should be fulfilled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And white robes were given unto every one of them;</span> <span class="accented">and there was given to each one a white robe.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>, "a white robe," is supported by A, C, [P], N, B, etc. The white robe of righteousness, the wedding garment of <a href="../../par/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11, 12</a>, is the sign of the blessedness of the saints. <span class="accented">White</span> is the colour of heavenly victory in the Apocalypse (see on ver. 2). The vision has recalled the past sufferings of the martyrs and their present expectation of the final consummation of their hopes, which is to be not yet. The other side is now to be shown; though they have not yet reached their final bliss, they have received the <span class="accented">white robe</span>, they are free from possibility of defilement, the victory is won, and they have <span class="accented">rest.</span> Comfort and encouragement are thus afforded to those still struggling in the world, who have not as yet attained to the white robe of perfect righteousness. And it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season. <a href="../../par/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. seems to determine the exact signification <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, viz. "rest in peace," "rest from their labours," rather than specifically "cease from uttering this cry" (ver. 10), as explained by De Wette and others. <span class="accented">For a little time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); that is, till the second coming of Christ, for the time which is to intervene before that event is frequently spoken of as a <span class="accented">little time</span> (see on Revelation 1:1; 20:3; 12:12; comp. <a href="../../par/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6, 7</a>, "Yet once a little time, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, the sea and the dry land, and all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come"). The time of the world is <span class="accented">little</span> in comparison with eternity. This <span class="accented">little time</span> is depicted and set forth under the six seals; it comes to an end at <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>, and merges into eternity in <a href="../../par/revelation/8-1.htm">Revelation 8:1</a>. Some expositors (of the historical school) understand a <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to be a definite, arbitrary number; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bengel considers it to be 1111 1/9 years (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' p. 485). <span class="cmt_word">Until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</span> R, B, P, read <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "shall have fulfilled" [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their course]; A, C, read <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "should be completed." "Their fellow servants also and their brethren" may not denote two separate bodies, notwithstanding that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> occurs twice, but, as Alford remarks, it may point out the same persons viewed in two aspects - first, the Christians needed to proceed with and finish Christ's work as his servants; second, the same ones needed to complete the number of his family. But it seems more likely that reference is intended to two classes of Christians - first, <span class="accented">their fellow servants</span>, that is, all Christians, who may, however, not suffer martyrdom; and, second, <span class="accented">their brethren</span>, the martyrs, who, like them, should yet be killed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a></div><div class="verse">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal;</span> <span class="accented">and I saw when he opened.</span> The events described accompany the opening as in the case of the preceding visions (see on vers. 1, 3, 5, etc.). The sixth seal describes the end of the world - the transition of the saints from earth to heaven, with the accompanying circumstances. It is important to remember that the whole is a vision, and we must therefore guard against expecting a literal interpretation of the language used. Following the manner of the prophets, and the description given by our Lord himself of the judgment day, St. John portrays the wonder and awe and consternation which will then be prevalent under the figure of falling stars. etc. How much, if any, may, in the destruction of the world, literally come to pass, it is impossible to say; but we must be content to receive the general impression which is undoubtedly intended to be conveyed to us, without pressing the individual particulars too far. The symbolism, as usual, bears evidence of its Old Testament origin; and the influence of our Lord's description in <a href="../../par/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>. is noticeable. The special revelation of God's presence or of his judgments is usually depicted under the figure of terrestrial commotion (see on Revelation 6:1; also <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>: <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>). The last three seals seem connected more especially with life in the next world. The fifth seal displays to us the souls of the faithful in peace, but desiring the perfect consummation of their bliss; the sixth announces the certainty of future judgment, when all will be set right, when the righteous will be preserved and the wicked justly recompensed; the seventh typifies the indescribable joy and peace of heaven. It seems reasonable, therefore, to consider the passage <a href="../../par/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12-7:17</a> as all contained under the sixth seal; since, although set forth at rather greater length than the other seals, it all follows in natural sequence - the destruction of the earth, the fear of the wicked, the preservation and joy of the righteous; and then follows heaven, portrayed under the opening of the seventh seal. Some have tried to separate <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. as "an episode," or rather two episodes, commencing at, and marked off by, the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> of ver. 1 and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of ver. 9, "after these things." But this expression, though undoubtedly marking, the beginning of a fresh phase of the subject, does not necessarily imply the opening of an entirely new and unconnected discourse. This view of the sixth seal is in harmony with what appears to be the general plan of the visions of the seals. It is important to bear in mind, in our interpretation of the Apocalypse, these two principles - first, the book was addressed to certain Christians for a definite purpose, and its object would be set forth so as to be comprehended by them; second, the truths thus contained must be such as to be applicable to the position of mankind in general in all ages. We have, therefore, to inquire to whom and for what purpose the book was primarily written, and then how the lessons contained can benefit mankind in general. It thus appears that the message was originally intended as an encouragement and a support to those Christians who were being persecuted, and were suffering in various ways, and whose patience might be inadequate to preserve them through trials so severe or so long. The visions of the seals would speak plainly to such as these. The first four would tell them that, though they must not doubt of Christ's final victory, it is yet with God's knowledge and permission that this life is afflicted with troubles of different kinds; it is not because God is weak, forgetful, or unjust Then, lest any should be tempted to ask, "Is it worth while? If Christianity involves all this suffering, would it not be better to be as the world is, and escape?" a picture of the future is given. The fifth seal shows that, immediately upon the completion of this life, the souls of the righteous are at peace; and the sixth seal shows that a day of reckoning will certainly come for the world; while the seventh seal is an assurance of heaven. It <span class="accented">is</span> worth while, therefore, to endure and to persevere, both on account of God's reward to the just, and his retribution upon the unjust. Thus would the signification of the visions be easily comprehended by those for whom they were originally intended; and the same lessons are equally valuable for the Church at all time. Grotius considers that this vision refers to the destruction of Jerusalem; Elliott, Faber, and Mede refer its accomplishment to the beginning of the fourth century; Wordsworth sees the "last age" of the Church represented; Stern thinks it indicates the general state of the Church; Wetstein, the commotions in Judaea previous to the destruction of Jerusalem; while Cunninghame and Frere see a reference to the French Revolution of 1789. But these interpretations do not fulfil the conditions mentioned above, since the Christians to whom this book is addressed were ignorant of those events yet in the future. <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, there was a great earthquake.</span> Omit "lo." The earthquake is the usual manifestation of God's presence or special dealing with men (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). This is the answer to the question of the saints in the fifth seal - the period of probation is finite. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair. Thus <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-3.htm">Isaiah 50:3</a>, "I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the moon became as blood;</span> <span class="accented">the whole</span> moon (cf. <a href="../../par/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, quoted in <a href="../../par/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>, "The stars shall fall from heaven"). The figure of "stars" is sometimes used to typify "rulers," as in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, "There shall come a star out of Jacob;" <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, "I [Lucifer] will exalt my throne above the stars of God." Some have thus been led to find a particular application of this sentence. Stern considers that the falling away of Christian rulers is signified; while many refer it to the overthrew of pagan rulers. <span class="cmt_word">Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind;</span> <span class="accented">her unripe figs.</span> Probably the unripe figs of the spring, many of which would be shaken down by a strong wind, or possibly the winter figs, which commonly fall off while unripe. The figure is doubtless suggested by <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, taken in conjunction with the parable of <a href="../../par/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;</span> <span class="accented">and the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up. The scroll</span> - the parchment book or roll, which is spread out to read, and, when read, roiled up and put away. The passage is apparently founded upon <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. "The host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll," etc. <span class="cmt_word">And every mountain and island were moved out of their places</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>, "Every mountain and hill shall be made low;" also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-23.htm">Jeremiah 3:23</a>, "Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains"). The enumeration of <span class="accented">seven</span> objects in vers. 12-14 seems to denote the all extending nature of God's judgment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the earth</span>. The first of the seven classes mentioned. The enumeration is again all extensive, embracing all classes, and men of every degree of social distinction. Bishop Newton is probably not correct in seeing an allusion to particular kings. <span class="cmt_word">And the great men;</span> <span class="accented">princes</span> (Revised Version). <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> are the grandees, the courtiers, as distinguished from those who are governors and hold military command, and who are subsequently mentioned as the "chief captains." <span class="cmt_word">And the rich men, and the chief captains</span>. The Revised Version reverses the order, and places "chief captains" first. The chief captains (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are those holding military rank (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/6-21.htm">Mark 6:21</a>, "Herod made a supper to his lords, high captains," etc.; <a href="../../par/john/18.htm">John 18</a>, "The captain and officers took Jesus;" <a href="../../par/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>, "The chief captain of the band "). <span class="cmt_word">And the mighty men.</span> Probably those possessing great bodily strength. <span class="cmt_word">And every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.</span> "Every" is omitted before "free man" by A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Andreas, and Arethas. <span class="accented">The dens</span>; in Revised Version <span class="accented">caves</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, "And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth"). Again, as in vers. 12-14, the enumeration is sevenfold; thus denoting the universality and completeness of the extent of the judgment (see <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a></div><div class="verse">And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>, "They shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us;" also <a href="../../par/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>, "Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us ") <span class="cmt_word">of him that sitteth on the throne.</span> The Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). <span class="cmt_word">And from the wrath of the Lamb.</span> The result of the wroth of the Lamb is depicted in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>. God's wrath with the wicked is the assurance of his mercy and love for the righteous. Thus in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>, we have, "The nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants," etc. Similarly, in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10-13</a>, the <span class="accented">wrath</span> of God upon the wicked is associated with the peace of the faithful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a></div><div class="verse">For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the great day of his wrath is come.</span> <span class="accented">Of their wrath</span>, which is read in the Revised Version, is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, 38, Vulgate, Syriae; but <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "his," is supported by A, B, F, Coptic, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius. The article is repeated, making the term almost a proper name - the <span class="accented">day, the great</span> [<span class="accented">day</span>]. Alford remarks that this of itself should be sufficient to keep commentators right in confining their interpretation of this seal to the last judgment (cf. <a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). And who shall be able to stand? <span class="accented">Who is able</span> (Revised Version). Thus <a href="../../par/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, "Who shall stand when he appeareth?" And <a href="../../par/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>. Thus, then, the question in ver. 10, "How long?" is answered; not by limiting the length of time, but by a renewed assurance of an awful termination of the course of the world, at the appearance of the Judge. The dread attending that end is vividly portrayed, and the fear of the wicked, with their conscience-stricken inquiry, "Who is able to stand?" an answer to which is required for the edification of the faithful. And, therefore, the seer immediately describes the preservation of the righteous from amidst the destruction of the wicked, and their raptured praises, a joyous contrast with the despairing fate of those whose doom has just been narrated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/revelation/7.htm"><title>Revelation 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/revelation/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/revelation/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/revelation/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../revelation/6.htm" title="Revelation 6">&#9668;</a> Revelation 7 <a href="../revelation/8.htm" title="Revelation 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after these things.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, or, as some cursives read, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is generally regarded as denoting the close of the sixth seal and the commencement of a new subject, interjected by way of episode between the sixth and seventh seals. But, even if not looked upon as an integral part of the revelations made under the sixth seal, the connection is so close that the two must be regarded practically as one. The incidents of the seventh chapter are evidently the complement of those narrated in the closing verses of the sixth. They take up the question with which that chapter closes, "Who is able to stand?" and afford comfort and help to those suffering Christians who were so sorely in need of a renewed assurance of the certainty of their final reward. It seems better, therefore, on the whole, to consider the sixth seal to extend to the end of <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. Vitringa takes this view, which appears to be supported also by Wordsworth. Alford, while separating <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. from <a href="../../par/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, as "two episodes," remarks, "The great day of the Lord's judgment is not described; it is all but brought before us under the sixth seal, and is actually going on in the first of these episodes." <span class="cmt_word">I saw four angels.</span> Of the nature of these angels we are told nothing. They are evidently ministers of God's will, and the mention of them following immediately upon the preceding description seems to connect the whole account more closely with <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29, 30</a>, where the angels gather the elect from the four winds. It does not seem probable that "evil angels" are meant as understood by some writers, since what they do is apparently done at the command of God. <span class="cmt_word">Standing on the four corners of the earth</span>. That is, standing in the four opposite directions, and thus controlling all the earth (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>). The number four is the symbol of universality and of creation (see on Revelation 5:9). <span class="cmt_word">Holding the four winds of the earth</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). The angels may have been the "angels of the winds," just as in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a> an angel has power over fire, and in <a href="../../par/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a> we read of the "angel of the waters." The <span class="accented">winds</span> have been interpreted in two ways, neither of which seems strictly correct. The first is to give a literal meaning (as Dusterdieck) to the winds, and to understand literal windstorms as part of the judgment upon the earth. The second method interprets the winds as symbols of the judgments of the first six seals, which are held in suspension, while the elect are sealed. The truth probably is that the <span class="accented">winds</span>, like the <span class="accented">earthquake</span>, the rolling up of the heaven as a scroll, etc., are part of the figurative description of the destruction of the world at the judgment day; which destruction, like that of Sodom, is delayed for the preservation of God's elect. <span class="cmt_word">That the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "every tree," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, P, l, 36, Andreas, etc. The earth, the sea, the trees, are mentioned as things likely to be affected by the action of the winds; the two former, of course, embracing those things situated upon them, and the last being specially mentioned, perhaps, as a class of things which are peculiarly liable to destruction from wind. Wordsworth and others, interpreting symbolically, consider that the blasts of wind on the earth typify earthly powers, opposed to those of heaven, while the sea is emblematic of nations in a state of agitation against God, and the trees represent the great ones of this world. This interpretation, therefore, regards the objects mentioned as the enemies of God, which, by his command, are preserved from destruction and allowed to flourish in ease and apparent security, until the time of the sealing of God's servants has been accomplished. But it seems better to regard the winds as forming part of the general description by which God's judgment is foreshadowed. It is not unusual in the Bible for the wind to be mentioned in connection With destruction and judgment (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>: <a href="../../par/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw another angel ascending from the east;</span> <span class="accented">from the rising of the sun.</span> Again no individual angel is particularized, though an archangel <span class="accented">may</span> be intended, as he has authority over the first four. He proceeds from that quarter whence comes light; and, like the Sun of Righteousness, he rises with healing in his wings; for his mission is to render secure the servants of God. Wordsworth thinks Christ, or a messenger from Christ, is meant - a view shared by Hengstenberg; Vitringa says the Holy Ghost; Victorinus, the Prophet Elijah. That this angel was of like nature with the first four appears probable from the words in ver. 3, "till we have sealed the servants of our God." Having the seal of the living God. The sealing instrument with which they seal God's servants. Of its nature we are told nothing beyond what is contained in ver. 3. He is specially referred to as "the <span class="accented">living</span> God," since, by this sealing, <span class="accented">life</span> is imparted. We have here the shorter expression, "the living God," not, as in all ether places of the Apocalypse, "him that liveth forever and ever" (see <a href="../../par/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-14.htm">Revelation 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/15-7.htm">Revelation 15:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>) <span class="cmt_word">to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea;</span> that is, by letting loose the winds, as shown by vers. 1 and 3. Bengel and Rinck, looking only at the immediate context, thought that the hurt was done by preventing the winds from blowing on the earth and cooling it in the scorching plagues which follow (<a href="../../par/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>). The <span class="accented">trees</span> are not mentioned, being included in <span class="accented">the earth</span>; and this appears to indicate that the expression, "the earth, the sea, and the trees" (vers. 1 and 3), signifies the world in general, without being intended to represent individual parts, as the great men, etc. (see on Revelation 5:1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees</span>. <span class="accented">Hurt not</span>, by loosing the four winds, as stated on ver. 2. The destruction prepared for the guilty world is not allowed to fall until God's elect have been gathered in, and preserved free from danger (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>, where immediately after the appearance of the Son of man, his elect are gathered from the four winds). (For the signification of the <span class="accented">earth</span>, the <span class="accented">sea</span>, and the <span class="accented">trees</span>, see on vers. 1 and 2.) <span class="cmt_word">Till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads</span>. The angel associates himself with the first four, as being on an equality with them in this work, although he alone is stated to possess the seal (ver. 2). Of the nature of the sealing nothing more is indicated. The <span class="accented">forehead</span> is naturally mentioned as being the most conspicuous part of man, as well as that which we are accustomed to regard as the noblest and most vital part. The idea may be compared with that in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4, 6</a>. It is remarkable, too, that the word in Ezekiel rendered "mark" is the name of the Hebrew letter <span class="accented">tau</span>, of which the ancient form was a cross (cf. the sign of the cross in baptism; also <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, "I will write upon him the Name of my God... and my new Name;" and <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>, "Having his Father s Name written in their foreheads"). "The servants of our God," says Bengel, is a title which especially belongs to holy men in Israel (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-17.htm">Genesis 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>). Those who hold the preterist view believe that the Christians who escaped the destruction of Jerusalem are indicated by this expression. The sealed are probably these referred to by our Lord in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22, 24, 31</a>, as "the elect." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard the number of them which were sealed: <i>and there were</i> sealed an hundred <i>and</i> forty <i>and</i> four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the number of them which were sealed.</span> The description of the actual operation of sealing is omitted (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9.htm">Ezekiel 9</a>, where it is also omitted). And there were <span class="cmt_word">sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand</span>. Omit "and there were." This number - the square of 12 multiplied by 1000 - is typical of a large and perfect number. No one has ever said that the number should be taken literally; and there are evident reasons why it could not be so intended. We have, therefore, to inquire what is its symbolical signification. The number 12 is always typical, in the Apocalypse and elsewhere, of a complete and perfect number. It is formed of 4 multiplied by 3. Four is generally representative of the created universe, and 3 of the Godhead (see <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). 4 plus 3, that is 7; and 4 multiplied by 3, that is 12, indicate a perfect number - a number which includes and embraces everything. And thus 12 multiplied by 12 denotes the most exhaustive and perfect completion. The number 1000 is generally used to denote a large and complete, but somewhat uncertain, number (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>, etc.). Thus the square of 12 multiplied by 1000 has the signification of a large number not definitely fixed, but nevertheless perfect; that is to say, not omitting a single one of those who should be included in the number. We are therefore taught that at the judgment day, before the destruction of the world is allowed to take place, a large number, consisting of those who have proved themselves to be God's servants, will be preserved and set apart; and that, although the number may be large, yet it will be perfect, not one of those who are worthy to be selected being overlooked or forgotten. This number subsequently is increased, being included in the "great multitude which no man could number" of ver. 9, and which is formed by the whole company of the redeemed. <span class="cmt_word">Of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</span> The Authorized Version here appears to give the correct sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, "every." The number is made up not necessarily by an equal number from each tribe, but by a number from the twelve tribes viewed as a whole. As explained above, the number one thousand, though signifying "completeness," is not a definite number. Here, as elsewhere, it is the spiritual <span class="accented">Israel</span> which is signified. In support of this view, we may remark: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The constant use in the Apocalypse of the terms" Israel," "Jew," "Jerusalem," etc., in the spiritual sense; and it seems scarcely credible that the writer of the book, who throughout insists on the fulfilment in the Christian religion of all things Jewish, should in this place, for no apparent reason, deliberately make a distinction between Jew and Gentile.

Some, however, have considered that the hundred and forty-four thousand are distinct from, and not included in, the multitude of ver. 9. They believe the former indicates the converted from among the Jews, and the latter those saved from the Gentiles. Thus Bengel, Dusterdieck, Ebrard, Grotius, etc. But it may be remembered that in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-3.htm">Revelation 14:3, 4</a>, the hundred and forty-four thousand redeemed from the earth and from among men is not confined to Jews. By other commentators the number has been thought to denote converts in the age of Constantine, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/7-5.htm">Revelation 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">Of the tribe of Juda <i>were</i> sealed twelve thousand.

It does not seem probable that any special design underlies the selection and arrangement here. First, with regard to the selection, we observe that Dan and Ephraim are omitted, the number being completed by inserting Levi, Joseph, and Manasseh. Although Ephraim and Manasseh are sometimes inserted instead of Joseph and Levi, and sometimes omitted, there seems only one example of a list in which any one of the others is omitted, viz. that in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, where no mention is made of Simeon. It has been thought that Simeon was purposely passed over by Moses on account of his ill conduct (see <a href="../../par/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.) - conduct for which, unlike Levi, he afterwards made no sufficient atonement. This has led many commentators (Hengstenberg, Wordsworth, etc.) to conclude that Dan finds no place here because of the idolatrous worship of the tribe (<a href="../../par/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>.). Many ancient writers (Bede, Andreas, etc.) account, somewhat similarly, for the omission by supposing that, in accordance with a very commonly received opinion, antichrist would arise from this tribe - an opinion probably originated by a comparison of the "serpent" of <a href="../../par/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a> with <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>. A third group, amongst whom are Ebrard, Dusterdieck, De Wette, Grotius, referring to an ancient Jewish tradition that the tribe of Dan had become extinct, and relying on the omission of this tribe in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4.htm">1 Chronicles 4-7</a>. - though Hushim (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12</a>) may be the sons of Dan (see <a href="../../par/genesis/46-23.htm">Genesis 46:23</a>) - believe that the children of Dan no longer existed, and were therefore omitted. In the insertion of the name Manasseh (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Forgetting") Bengel sees an intended allusion to the omission of Dan, who is, he thinks, omitted for some mysterious reason. Ewald believes that St. John wrote <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x391;&#x39d;</span>, and that MAN., the abbreviated form of "Manasses," was substituted by error; and he appeals to manuscripts 9, 13, which, however, have "Dan" in place of "Gad." Moreover, Irenaeus, Origen, Arethas, have "Manasseh," and state plainly that Dan was omitted. It is certainly curious in connection with this conjecture that, if it were true, that is to say, if "Dan" should be read in place of "Manasseh," we should have a more intelligible order of arrangement. In that case, speaking generally, the elder sons would come first, the younger last; all the pairs of brothers are kept together (only that, in the case of the six brothers, there is a division into two lots); Judah naturally is placed first before Reuben, owing to the prominent place held by him in the Apocalypse in connection with our Lord. The order would then be - <span class="cmt_word">sons of Leah</span>.<br />Juda, Reuben Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon <span class="cmt_word">sons of Zilpah</span>.<br />Gad, Aser <span class="cmt_word">sons of Bilhah</span>.<br />Nepthalim, [Dan,] <span class="cmt_word">sons of Rachel.</span><br />Joseph, Benjamin <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand</span>. As remarked above, Judah probably precedes Reuben from the greater importance he would possess in the mind of the writer of the Apocalypse, who continually exalts Christ, "the Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Gad</span> were <span class="cmt_word">sealed twelve thousand.</span>

Wordsworth considers that this is on account of the rebellions character of the tribe of Ephraim (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5.htm">Hosea 5</a>, etc.). But Ephraim is sometimes identical with Joseph (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>), who here finds a place among the twelve.

It is the immediate prelude to the opening of the seventh seal (see on Revelation 8:1). <a href="../../par/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>. recounts the terrors of God's judgments on the wicked, and especially those of the final judgment; but lest the godly should be dismayed and ask, "Who is able to stand" (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>) on that great day? it is revealed that the faithful are first selected and preserved. This occupies the first eight verses of <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. But all is not yet quite ready for the opening of the seventh and last seal. There is, besides those sealed on the last day, an innumerable company with whom the former are joined in one body; and a glimpse is afforded of their conjoint adoration and of that supreme bliss which is entered upon, but not described, under the seventh seal. The "great multitude which no man could number" includes, therefore, the hundred and forty-four thousand of ver. 4. They have escaped the terror of the final judgment of the world (see ver. 3), but have formerly experienced tribulation (see ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">Of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues;</span> <span class="accented">out of every nation and</span> [<span class="accented">all</span>] <span class="accented">tribes and peoples and tongues.</span> The classification, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, is fourfold, symbolical of completeness in matters of creation (see on Revelation 5:9; 4:6, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Stood before the throne, and before the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">standing before</span>, etc. We are carried back to the description given in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1-4</a> and Revelation 5:6-11. <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with white robes;</span> <span class="accented">arrayed in</span> (Revised Version).

Trench states that no symbol of heathen origin is used in the Apocalypse; and he connects the palm-bearing multitude with the celebration of the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles. Wordsworth and Hengstenberg take the same view; and there is much to be said in favour of it, though Alford and others connect the image rather with the Greek and Roman sign of victory. In the first place, the word is used by St. John in <a href="../../par/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>, where doubtless it is connected with the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles. Secondly, the use of such an image would more naturally occur to one so familiar with Jewish customs and ritual as the writer of the Apocalypse; and, moreover, the idea commemorated by this feast - that of the enjoyment of rest and plenty, the possession of the promised Canaan after toil and delay - is peculiarly applicable to the condition of those here described. Thirdly, the idea seems carried on in the mind of the writer, and referred to in ver. 15 in the words, "shall spread his tabernacle over them" (see Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/7-10.htm">Revelation 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And cried with a loud voice;</span> <span class="accented">and they cry</span>, etc. The present tense expresses the unceasing nature of their occupation (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Salvation to our God;</span> that is, "The praise and honour due for our salvation belongs to God, since he is the Cause of our salvation." Note the similarity to the "Hosanna" of the palm-bearing multitude of the Feast of Tabernacles (see <a href="../../par/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>; 2 Macc. 10:6, 7; <a href="../../par/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</span> To the Triune God, and to the Lamb (see on Revelation 4:2; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>).

The repeated article is especially emphatic. The question arises What is "the great tribulation" referred to? Probably all the tribulation which has been passed through by the redeemed, all that which pertained to the life though which they have passed. This tribulation is now completed and past, and is therefore referred to as "the great tribulation." "These are they which have passed through the great tribulation of their life on earth." This is the view taken by Alford. Dusterdieck refers the expression to the last great trial of the saints before the coming of the Lord. Some point to particular persecutions as the reference intended, and others consider that "the last great trial to be expected under the seventh seal" is meant. <span class="cmt_word">And have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">and they washed</span>, etc. That is, during their past life, while they were experiencing the great tribulation, they washed their robes (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5</a>, where those who have "not defiled their garments" and those "that overcome" are to be clothed in white). Those that overcome and are undefiled, therefore, are those who have washed themselves in the blood of the Lamb, through which only their victory is possible or effective. Arethas, Bede, De Lyra, consider that the robes are washed of those who have endured martyrdom, and that they are washed in the blood of the Lamb, because it is the blood of his members.

This completes the number, and sets the roll free (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>). The contents of the roll do not, however, become visible, nor are they portrayed otherwise than by the silence of half an hour (see on Revelation 5:1). <span class="cmt_word">There was silence in heaven</span>; <span class="accented">there followed a silence</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">a silence became</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> where there had not been silence previously, owing to the praises set forth at the close of <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. This image may have been suggested by the silence kept by the congregation without, while the priest offered incense within, the temple (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/1-10.htm">Luke 1:10</a>). This thought, too, may have led to the following vision, in which the angel offers incense (ver. 3), and in this souse the vision of the trumpets may be said to have grown out of the seventh seal, though a similar act precedes the visions of the seals (see <a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). But in no other way is there any connection between the two visions; the events narrated under the vision of the trumpets are not an exposition of the seventh seal, but a separate vision, supplementing what has been set forth by the seven seals. The <span class="accented">silence</span> is typical of the eternal peace of heaven, the ineffable bliss of which it is impossible for mortals to comprehend, and which is, therefore, symbolized by silence. In the same way the <span class="accented">new name</span> is left unexplained, as something beyond the knowledge of man in this life, and reserved for the life in heaven (see on Revelation 3:12). It is the sabbath of the Church's history, into the full comprehension of which man cannot now enter. The interpretation of this seal varies with different writers, according to the view taken of the vision as a whole. Bede, Primasius, Victorinus, Wordsworth, agree in considering that it denotes the beginning of eternal peace. Those who take the preterist view variously assign the <span class="accented">silence</span> to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the destruction of Jerusalem (Manrice); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A.D. 312-337 (King); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the period following A.D.  (Eiliott); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the millennium (Lange); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the decree of Julian imposing silence on the Christians (De Lyra), etc.; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Vitringa thinks it relates to the time when the Church will be triumphant on earth; Hengstenberg, the astonishment of Christ's enemies; Ebrard, the silence of creation in awe at the catastrophes about to happen; and Dusterdieck, similarly, the silence of those in heaven, waiting for the same events. <span class="cmt_word">About the space of half an hour.</span> Most writers are agreed that the <span class="accented">half hour</span> represents a <span class="accented">short</span> time. But if (as we have indicated above) the silence is typical of the eternal rest of heaven, how can it be short? Possibly the answer is that the shortness refers to the time during which the seer was contemplating this aspect of the vision. He had now arrived at the end; the fate of the Church had been in some measure foreshadowed, and the final assurance is peace in heaven. That part of the fate in store for the Church cannot be expounded by the seer. He is permitted, as it were, to visit the threshold for an instant, and then he is called away. His message is not yet complete; he is summoned to receive yet further revelations. But may not the half hour signify "a long time"? The seer, in his vision, after beholding a succession of events, experiences a pause - complete silence for the space of half an hour. This time would appear almost interminable in such circumstances; and the phrase may therefore be intended to express "an exceedingly lengthened period," such as a stillness of such a length in the midst of numbers would appear to St. John. Here, then, closes the vision of the seals. The first four, prefaced by the assurance of final victory, deal with events more immediately connected with this life, and explain to the suffering Christian of all ages that it is part of God's eternal purpose that he should be exposed to persecution, trial, and temptation while in the world, and that such suffering is not the result of God's forgetfulness or heedlessness. The last three seats refer to three sets of events connected with the life hereafter. The fifth shows the security of those who have departed this life; the sixth portrays the safe gathering of God's own, and the fear and condemnation of the unjust at the judgment day; the seventh affords a prospect rather than a sight of the eternal sabbath of heaven, undescribed because indescribable. The whole is thus completed; the seer is called away to review the ages once more - to behold new visions, which shall impress more fully, and supplement, the truths which the visions of the seals have, in a measure, revealed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-2.htm">Revelation 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6</span> form a preface to the vision of the trumpets, and serve both to connect this vision with what has gone before, and to indicate the cause of this further revelation. The series of mysteries embraced under the seals is completed, and has so far accomplished its purpose, which is to fortify the patience of the saints by the assurance of God's providence and their ultimate victory and reward. But this is only one part of the seer's mission; there is not only a message of encouragement to the faithful, but a warning for the worldly and apostate. No doubt the same ground is covered to some extent by both announcements; since what is encouragement and hope for the righteous is judgment for the wicked. But whereas, in the vision of the seals, the punishment of the wicked holds a subsidiary place, being only introduced for the purpose of demonstrating God's protection of the just, in the vision of the trumpets the destruction of the ungodly is the main theme, being intended, like the denunciations of the prophets of old, for a warning to those in sin, if haply any may yet be saved. It may, indeed, be said to be an answer to the cry in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" The same lout suffering delay of vengeance tempts the "foolish body" to say in his heart, "There is no God." While by the vision of the seals God is careful not to break the bruised reed, in the vision of the trumpets he vouchsafes a call to those who are less deserving of his consideration and mercy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The trumpets then form a series of visions denouncing God's judgments against the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They form an independent vision, and do not grow out of the seventh seal, in the sense of portraying what is intended to be disclosed under that seal. The number seven, alike in the case of the seals and in that of the trumpets, indicates the complete nature of each series, which is moreover demonstrated by their general character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The incidents depicted are synchronous with those of the seals; that is to say, they relate to the history of mankind front the beginning to the end of time and the commencement of eternity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> As in the case of the seals, they are general indications of God's judgments; and though particular events may be partial fulfilments, the complete fulfilment is in all time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> In their general features there are some points of resemblance and some of difference on a comparison with the seals. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> They may be divided into groups of four and three. In both visions the first group of four deals more immediately with the natural world, the last group of three has more connection with the spiritual life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> They terminate in a similar way, in the victory of the redeemed, who sing the praises of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> In both, greater elaboration or episode occurs after the sixth revelation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> The nature of the seventh seal is undisclosed, and this is to a certain extent paralleled in the trumpets by the silence concerning the third and last woe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> In consonance with the general purpose of the trumpets, there is no preliminary assurance of victory as with the first seal; this is reserved to the end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Several reasons may be suggested for the employment of the figure of <span class="accented">trumpets</span>, by which to announce each vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> It was the instrument in use among the Israelites for assembling people, either for warlike or peaceful purposes (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/10-1.htm">Numbers 10:1, 9, 10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> It was thus intimately connected with solemn proclamations or the delivery of God's messages of judgment or warning, and is thus used in the New Testament in describing the judgment day (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The use of trumpets on seven days at the destruction of Jericho, the type of all that is worldly, may have suggested the form of the vision here, in the announcement of the judgment and destruction of the world. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets;</span> <span class="accented">which stand</span> (Revised Version). "And I saw" introduces the new vision, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>, etc. Probably not during the <span class="accented">silence</span> (as Alford), but subsequent to it. "The seven angels" probably refers to a particular order of angels, or rather to those with a special mission; though, with our limited knowledge, it is impossible to determine exactly who they are or what their mission is. The passage in Tobit 12:15 is so similar as to be at once suggested: "I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels which present the prayers of the saints." But here <span class="accented">the seven</span> do not present the prayers of the saints, but <span class="accented">another angel</span> does so (ver. 3). De Wette and others think <span class="accented">the seven</span> are archangels (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, "With the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God"). Arethas, Ewald, etc., identify them with "the seven Spirits of God" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>). Others incline to the opinion that <span class="accented">the seven</span> are only distinguished from the other angels by being the seven who sound the trumpets, just as four others are alluded to in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>. (On the use of the number <span class="accented">seven</span>, see above; also on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer <i>it</i> with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And another angel came.</span> No particular angel is specified. Some writers, unable to accept the passage as meaning that the Church's prayers are offered by means of an angel, prefer to believe that Christ himself is indicated. (Thus Bede, Elliott, Primasius, Vitringa.) But, besides that the difficulty has no real existence, the same expression occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>, where there is no doubt of its meaning. Moreover, in no passage of the book is our Lord represented under the form of an angel. With regard to the office of the angels, Alford remarks (while supporting the view that the word here bears the ordinary signification), "They are simply <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and the action here described is a portion of that their ministry. <span class="accented">Through whom</span> the prayers are offered, we all know. He is our only Mediator and channel of grace." So also Wordsworth, "The angel is not here represented as giving <span class="accented">efficacy</span> to the prayers of all saints, but as taking part in them. There is a <span class="accented">communication</span> of prayer between <span class="accented">all</span> saints (namely, the saints departed, and the saints on earth), and the <span class="accented">holy angels</span> in heaven." And stood at the altar. The Revisers, accepting the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, Andreas, adopt <span class="accented">over the altar.</span> The Authorized reading follows A, P, 1, 17, 36. Alford remarks, "<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with genitive, not simply <span class="accented">juxta</span>, not <span class="accented">ante</span>, but <span class="accented">super</span>; so that his form appeared above it." <span class="accented">The altar</span> has been already mentioned (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>). If the view there taken be correct, and the <span class="accented">brazen altar</span> of sacrifice intended, the two altars mentioned in this verse are not identical; the second represents the golden altar of incense which stood before the veil (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>), but which now stands before the throne of God, the veil having disappeared. This view seems to be the correct one. The second altar is distinguished from the first by the addition of the qualification, "which was before the throne," as well as by the epithet "golden" - facts which are not mentioned in connection with the throne alluded to in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>. The order of events followed here, though not given in minute detail, resembles the ceremony of the Jewish worship. In the temple, the priest took burning coals from off the brazen altar, and proceeded to the altar of incense, on which to burn incense (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12, 13</a>). There appears to be a kind of progression in the insight which the seer affords us of the heavenly worship. In <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a> a door is opened, and St. John sees into heaven; he is, as it were, without the sanctuary. In this place he is permitted to advance in his vision within the sanctuary, and to observe the golden altar. In <a href="../../par/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a> and Revelation 15:5 the most holy place is disclosed, and the ark of the covenant is seen. Alford and Dusterdieck believe only one altar is here mentioned, and identify it with that of <a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>. De Wette, Hengstenberg, Wordsworth, think one altar only is intended, and that it is the altar of incense. Bengel, Ebrard, Vitringa, support the view given above. Bossuct says the altar is Christ, to whom the angel brings incense, that is, the prayers of the saints. <span class="cmt_word">Having a golden censer.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is found only here and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-29.htm">1 Chronicles 9:29</a> (LXX.). In the latter place it is rightly rendered "frankincense;" but the meaning here evidently requires "censer." It is described as of gold, in the same way that all the furniture of the heavenly realms is described in the Apocalypse. <span class="cmt_word">And there was given unto him much incense.</span> Apparently following the analogy of the temple service, the first angel brings in his <span class="accented">golden censer</span> fire from the brazen altar of sacrifice, and now there is "given unto him," by another angel, incense to burn at the <span class="accented">golden altar</span> of incense. (For <span class="accented">incense</span>, see on Revelation 5:8.) <span class="cmt_word">That he should offer it with the prayers of all saints;</span> <span class="accented">add it unto the prayers of all the saints</span> (Revised Version). The prayers are to be incensed, so as to (typically) render them pure and acceptable to God. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</span> That is, probably, the altar of incense, distinct from the altar mentioned earlier in this verse (see above). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-4.htm">Revelation 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the smoke of the incense, <i>which came</i> with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand;</span> <span class="accented">and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints went up</span>, etc. (Revised Version). The prayers, accompanied by the incense, and typically purified by it, are received by God. He hears the prayers; and the judgments against the wicked, which follow in the trumpet visions, constitute the answer to them. This makes more probable the view that the following visions are judgments against the world, and not (like the seals) trials to the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast <i>it</i> into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth;</span> <span class="accented">taketh the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth</span> (Revised Version). The angel now returns to the altar of burnt offering, whence he takes fire, which he casts upon the earth. This action denotes that God's judgments are about to descend on the earth, and it therefore forms the visible token of God's acceptance of the prayers of the saints, and his answer to them. <span class="cmt_word">And there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake;</span> <span class="accented">and there followed thunders, and voices</span>, etc. (Revised Version). The manifestation of God's presence or of his judgments is continually accompanied by awe-striking phenomena, such as are here described (see on Revelation 6:12). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-6.htm">Revelation 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span> This verse takes up and continues the narrative of ver. 2; the intervening passage serves to indicate the immediate cause of the judgments now about to descend, viz. the "prayers of the saints" (ver. 4). (On the number <span class="accented">seven</span>, as signifying a complete number, see <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.) Cf. the sounding of the trumpets at Jericho, and the other passages quoted in the comment on ver. 2. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first angel sounded</span>; <span class="accented">and the first sounded</span> (Revised Version). The word "angel" should be omitted here, though found in the other trumpets. The first four are marked off from the last three (as in the case of the seals) by distinctive features. The first four refer to the natural life, while the last three are connected more closely with the spiritual life of man. The first four are connected and interdependent; the last three are distinct and more detached. The last three are specially marked off by the announcement of the angel in ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">And there followed hail and fire mingled with blood;</span> <span class="accented">mingled in blood.</span> The English Version is ambiguous, but the Greek makes it clear that it is the bail and the fire that are mingled, and that both together are sent in blood. There is an evident likeness between the judgments of the trumpets and the plagues of Egypt. The resemblance is only general, but it serves to corroborate the belief that the trumpets declare God's judgments on the world, not the trials of the Church. The Church is the true Israel which exists uninjured by these manifestations of God's wrath in the midst of the world of Egyptian wickedness. The question next naturally arises - What are the judgments referred to, which are thus to afflict the ungodly while leaving the righteous unhurt; and when and how they are to take place? The answer evidently is - All troubles of the wicked, which are the consequence of misdoing, whether these troubles overtake them in this life or in the life to come. In the words of Alford, "These punishments are not merely direct inflictions of plagues, but consist in great part of that judicial retribution on them that know not God, which arises from their own depravity, and in which their own sins are made to punish themselves." This seems to follow from the view which we haw taken of the trumpet visions. They depict God's judgments on the wicked in all ages. Just as the seal visions were found to relate to the trials of God's people in all time, and the fulfilment is not completed by any one event or series of events, so now the seer is called upon to return, as it were, to his former starting point, and follow out a new path, where he would find displayed the troubles which have afflicted or shall afflict the ungodly. It is very doubtful how much of the imagery used in this series of visions is to be interpreted as applying to some definite event, and how much is to be considered merely as the accessories of the picture, necessitated by the employment of the symbol, and not needing particular interpretation. It is possible that the seer intended first to set forth the judgments which were to descend on those powers which, at the time of the vision, were pressing so heavily upon Christians, and among which the Roman empire held the prominent place. But it also seems probable that the woes symbolized are general types of the judgments in store for the wicked of all ages, perhaps in this life, certainly at the last day. The <span class="accented">blood</span> is not found in Exodus. It is mentioned in close connection with hailstones and fire in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>, and a similar thought occurs in <a href="../../par/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30</a>. The passage may describe the ruin wrought by war; the consequences of fire and sword. Wordsworth sees the fulfilment in the Gothic invasion of Rome, which descended from the <span class="accented">north</span>, here typified by the <span class="accented">hailstorm</span> (but see on Revelation 16:21). The vision would thus answer to that of the second seal, though with this difference, that under the seal war was permitted as a trial to the Church; here it is sent as God's vengeance against the persecutors. <span class="cmt_word">And they were cast upon the earth.</span> "That is," says Wordsworth, "on the earthly power, opposed to Christ and his Church, which is the kingdom of heaven." But the words seem rather to describe the destruction of inanimate creation, as in the seventh plague of Egypt. The punishment would undoubtedly fall upon mankind eventually, though immediately upon the earth and its productions. Vitringa says the <span class="accented">earth</span> denotes the Roman empire; the <span class="accented">sea</span>, the barbarous races. <span class="cmt_word">And the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</span> Insert <span class="accented">and the third part of the earth was burnt up</span>, as in the Revised Version. "A third of all the trees, etc., on the earth," rather than "all the trees, etc., on a specified third part of the earth." The <span class="accented">third part</span> is almost unanimously considered to represent "a large part, but such that the greater part was still uninjured." We are reminded again of the seventh plague, where "the flax and the barley were smitten: but the wheat and the rie were not smitten" (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>). Wordsworth interprets the <span class="accented">trees to</span> mean the "princes" of the Roman empire; the <span class="accented">grass</span>, the common people. So also Hengstenberg. Elliott thinks "the third part of the earth" denotes the western part of the Roman empire, the eastern and central parts at first escaping the visitation. Bengel sees here a type of the wars of Trajan and Hadrian. Vitringa considers that the famine under Gallus is signified. Renan points to the storms of A.D. -68 as the fulfilment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-8.htm">Revelation 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea.</span> <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a> contains a somewhat similar description, with, however, a different meaning. There the mountain is the heathen power; here it is the instrument of the punishment of the ungodly world. Alford objects to calling the mountain a volcano, though that, or something of the same nature, seems obviously to be meant. The contiguity of such appearances to St. John in the Isle of Patmos may have suggested the idea. The judgments appear to increase in severity as we go on. The first affects vegetation, thus causing trouble, but not destruction to men; the second begins to affect animal life; the third causes many men to die; and the following ones affect men as direct punishments. The vision may be said generally to typify great trouble and commotion. The figure is used in other places to denote something remarkable and awe inspiring (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-5.htm">Job 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-9.htm">Job 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-3.htm">Isaiah 34:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-20.htm">Ezekiel 38:20</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>). It is also the symbol of a great power. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> it signifies the Church; in <a href="../../par/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a> an earthly power; in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> the enemies of Israel. We may therefore conclude that a judgment of great magnitude and force is foretold; and though it is possible to point to particular events (such as the overthrow of Rome by the Gothic power) as a fulfilment of the prophecy, yet we must remember that the complete fulfilment will not he accomplished until "all enemies are put under his feet." <span class="cmt_word">And the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed;</span> <span class="accented">even they that had life</span> (Revised Version). (On the "third part," see on ver. 7.) Whether one third part of the sea, separated in some way from the rest, and all the creatures in that third part, or whether a third part diffused over the whole extent, is meant, it is impossible to say. The whole is a vision, and not subject to natural laws. The meaning is evident. As before, a large part, but not the largest, is signified and this time the judgment is directed against another portion of creation. The sea, as well as the productions of the earth, can be used by God as his agent by which to punish and warn mankind. The attempt to press the vision into a particular application has led to a variety of interpretations. Wordsworth and Elliott both think that the destruction of Roman ships is foretold; the former pointing to the ships as the instruments of commerce and luxury, the latter referring to the destruction of the Roman navy. Bengel, Grotius, Vitringa, see here a vision of war'. Hengstenberg believes the <span class="accented">sea to</span> typify this world; the <span class="accented">living creatures</span>, mankind; and the <span class="accented">ships</span>, villages and towns. Those who place the fulfilment of the vision in time subsequent to the sealing of <a href="../../par/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. fail to see that the trumpets do not follow the seals in chronological order, but that both are being fulfilled side by side in the same epoch; viz. that of the existence of man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-9.htm">Revelation 8:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp.</span> In the Old Testament trouble is foretold under the symbol of darkened stars (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>). In <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a> the falling of stars is part of the general picture of the coming of the judgment day. The description here may therefore symbolize an act of judgment - one more of the troubles inflicted by God upon the guilty world. The frequent use of the symbol, <span class="accented">star</span>, as a type of one in an exalted position, has led most commentators to interpret the star of individual rulers, especially of those who poisoned the waters of Divine truth by heresy. But it seems more likely that the event here portrayed carries one step further the description of God's vengeance on the wicked, which has been already partially set forth. At first vegetation, then the sea, now the land waters, are smitten. The star, as the means employed by God, is typical of the awe striking nature of the punishment, and is indicative of the fact that the judgment is the act of God, and proceeds directly from heaven, and is not to be attributed to merely natural circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">And it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.</span> Not upon a third part of the fountains, but upon all fountains, just as in ver. 7 "all green grass" is visited with the plague. As stated above, another part of creation (and therefore another portion, of mankind) is afflicted. It is, of course, Impossible to point out the complete fulfilment of this judgment, Which is yet being fulfilled, but we may mention as illustrations the trouble caused to man by means of land waters, by floods, by drought, by pestilence. As before, only <span class="accented">part</span> suffers from this visitation; the greater part is spared. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a></div><div class="verse">And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the star is called Wormwood.</span> The plant known to us under the name of <span class="accented">wormwood</span> is doubtless identical with the <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of this passage. The present English word is a corruption of <span class="accented">wer-mod</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">ware-mood</span>), which may be rendered "mind-preserver," a name given to the plant by the Saxons, on account of its fancied virtues; for it was believed to be a protection against madness. Such properties were formerly frequently ascribed to plants possessing bitter and nauseous tastes, such as that of the wormwood. Varieties of the plant are common in Palestine, and are widely distributed in the world. Among the ancients it was typical of bitter sorrow. Thus <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>, "Remembering my misery, the wormwood and the gall;" <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>, "I will feed them with wormwood." Here, therefore, the name indicates the effect of the star, viz. to cause intense trouble and sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">And the third part of the waters became wormwood;</span> that is, became bitter as wormwood, that is, charged with sorrow and disaster. The general effect of the incident is described in the name given to the chief actor, as in the case of the fourth seal (see <a href="../../par/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter;</span> <span class="accented">many of the men.</span> Possibly (though not necessarily) of the men dwelling near the waters. For the first time mention is made of the death of <span class="accented">men</span>, though, doubtless, it is implied in the preceding judgments. We may notice the contrast in the miracles of Moses, who sweetened the waters of Marah (<a href="../../par/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>.), and of Elisha (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-12.htm">Revelation 8:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars</span>. Still the created universe is the direct object of these visitations. The planets were smitten, but we are not told with what instrument. As Alford points out, this may teach us not to lay too great stress upon that part of the visions which describes the means. Our attention is to be fixed upon the effect, the stroke, not upon the mountain or the star by whose means the result is attained. (For the signification of <span class="accented">the third part, vide supra.</span>) In the Bible, frequent use is made of this figure to express trouble and commotion (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). The sun, etc., are also looked upon as examples of stability. Thus <a href="../../par/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>, "As long as the sun and moon endure" (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a>). The vision may therefore be suggestive of God's power over things the most permanent and stable, and thus demonstrate to Christians his ability to punish "the ungodly who prosper in the world." Thus <a href="../../par/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a> attributes omnipotence to God, "which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and scaleth up the stars" (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/136-8.htm">Psalm 136:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>). Thus, then, God can turn even the benign influences of the sun and planets into means for the destruction of man. In the countless evils which have their origin in the excess or defect of the power of the sun, we may see an illustration of the fulfilment of this judgment. We may point out that the very existence of such visitations as are here portrayed preclude the possibility of the fulfilment of the trumpet visions being subsequent in time to those of the seals. <span class="cmt_word">So as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise;</span> <span class="accented">that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.</span> Probably, total darkness for a third part of the day and night is meant; not a third of the usual amount of light during the whole day and night (as Bengel and others). Renan, as a preterist, sees the fulfilment in the eclipses of A.D. . De Lyra, Wordsworth, and others see in this judgment a symbol of the infidelity, heresies, apostasies, and confusions in the world in the seventh century and at other times. Vitringa, adopting the historical view, refers the fulfilment to particular periods of the Roman empire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a></div><div class="verse">And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld, and heard an angel.</span> "An eagle" (Revised Version) is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, etc., while "angel" is found in P, 1, 16, 34, 47, etc. One manuscript (13) has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. St. John sees <span class="accented">one eagle</span>, the symbol of what is swift and unerring in swooping upon its prey. Thus <a href="../../par/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, "The eagle that hasteth to the prey" (see also <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). This is the meaning of the appearance of <span class="accented">the eagle</span>, which announces the swiftness and certainty of the coming woes. De Wette and others unnecessarily understand "an angel in the form of an eagle." De Lyra interprets it as St. John himself. Wordsworth, relying chiefly on the force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>, believes that Christ is signified; but it is extremely doubtful whether the force of the numeral can be pressed so far. Others see a reference to the Roman legions, etc. The figure may have been suggested by <a href="../../par/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Flying through the midst of heaven;</span> <span class="accented">flying in mid heaven</span> (Revised Version).

In <a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a> "the stars" are "the angels of the seven Churches;" in <a href="../../par/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> the angels are called "stars;" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a> we have Satan referred to thus: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!" It seems, therefore, that Satan himself is here referred to under this symbol. The trumpet visions hitherto have portrayed troubles affecting the outer man; now begin to be set forth these yet more terrible visitations which, affecting his spiritual nature, are seen more directly to emanate from the devil. He has fallen "from heaven unto the earth;" that is, whereas formerly heaven was his abode, the sphere of his work while yet obedient to God, he now has no office or power, or entrance there, but is permitted to exercise what influence he possesses on the earth (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven"). This is the view of Tertullian, Aretbas, Bede, Vitriuga, Alford, believe an evil angel is meant; Wordsworth thinks an apostate Christian teacher is signified; Andreas, Bengel, and De Wette believe a good angel is intended; others see particular emperors, etc.; while Hengstenberg thinks the figure represents not one, but a number of persons, including Napoleon. <span class="cmt_word">And to him was given the key of the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">of the pit of the abyss</span> (Revised Version). That is, as Wordsworth explains, of the aperture by which there is no egress from or ingress into the abyss.

The <span class="accented">abyss</span> is the abode of the devil and his angels; the present abode, not the lake of fire, into which they are subsequently cast (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).

But it is the smoke, not the locusts, which is here said to cause the obscurity; the locusts issue forth out of the smoke. It is doubtful whether we ought to seek any particular interpretation of <span class="accented">the smoke</span>; it is probably only accessory to the general picture. If we may press the meaning so far, it is perhaps best to regard the smoke as the evil influence of the devil, which darkens men's understandings, and from which issue the troubles which are the result of heresy and infidelity, portrayed by the locusts (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving," etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth.</span> The <span class="accented">locust</span> is constantly referred to in the Bible, and various illustrations are drawn from their characteristic features. In the East they appear in great numbers and men are helpless against their devastating power. Sometimes an attempt is made to check their progress by lighting fires, and this practice may have suggested the above description of the locusts proceeding from the smoke. The irresistible destruction which they cause is alluded to in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13</a>; their number in <a href="../../par/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-15.htm">Nahum 3:15</a>. The air is sometimes tainted with their dead bodies (<a href="../../par/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>). The natural features of the locust are fully dwelt upon in vers. 7-10. As an illustration, we may quote Niebuhr, who gives an Arab's description of the locust: "In head like the horse, in breast like the lion, in feet like the camel, in body like the serpent, in tail like the scorpion, in antennae like a virgin's hair." Three out of these five points of resemblance are mentioned in vers. 7-10. The <span class="accented">locusts</span> here symbolize heretics and infidels. Some writers (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Wordsworth) apply the symbol to the Mohammedans (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, where the parallel is very fully worked out). But though this may be, and probably is, a fulfilment of the vision, it would be wrong to thus restrict our interpretation. Scarcely any one cause has contributed more to the trouble and destruction of men than the violence which is the result of religious hatred. Whether it be the heathen idolater, the warlike Mohammedan, or the Christian bigot, who is the agent, the effect is the same. It may be said, too, that if the minds of Christians also had not been darkened by the prejudicial influence of Satan, who is the cause of their unhappy divisions, heresies, and apostasies, these troubles could scarcely have fallen upon mankind. The innumerable occasions of such violence may be well illustrated by the countless number of the locusts; and the effect lives after the death of the authors, tainting the moral atmosphere. It is true that the true Christian sometimes suffers also; but tidal is an aspect which is set forth in the visions of the seals. Here another view is set forth, namely, that the ungodly are themselves punished, and punished severely, by means of this evil influence of the devil. Many other interpretations have been suggested: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> evil spirits (Andrea,); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Roman wars in Judaea (Grotius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Gothic invasion (Vitringa); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> De Wette and Alford believe that the interpretation is unknown. <span class="cmt_word">And unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</span> That is to say, just as the natural scorpions of the earth have power to cause suffering, so these allegorical locusts of the vision appeared to possess the means wherewith to plague mankind. <span class="accented">The scorpion</span> is "generally found in dry and in dark places, under stones and in ruins, chiefly in warm climates....  The sting, which is situated at the extremity of the tail, has at its base a gland that secretes a poisonous fluid, which is discharged into the wound .... In hot climates the sting often occasions much suffering and sometimes alarming symptoms" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible '). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree.</span> The force of this plague is to fall directly upon mankind, not, as in the former judgments, upon the earth, and then indirectly upon men. This appears to be stated with the greater plainness, because it might readily be inferred, from the nature of locusts, that the immediate object of their destructiveness would be the vegetation of the world. <span class="cmt_word">But only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads;</span> <span class="accented">but only such men as have not</span>, etc. (Revised Version; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>, to which this is an allusion). Here, by proleipsis, the servants of God are described as "those that have the seal of God in their foreheads." It is not stated, nor is it necessarily implied, that the seal is visible to man at the time of the infliction of this judgment upon the ungodly. In a similar way our Lord speaks of the elect (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>), not thereby implying that there is any visible manifestation by which the elect may be known to men, though known to God (so also <a href="../../par/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>, etc.). Thus also it is said in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>, "The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his." The frequent use of the term to denote those who were sealed by baptism may have led to the employment of the expression in this place, as being equivalent to "the servants of God" (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>). The locusts may not hurt God's servants (see on ver. 3). Thus we are taught that God in reality preserves his own, though it may sometimes appear to man as though the innocent suffer with the guilty.

The evils which follow in the train of heresy and infidelity are not as yet permitted to kill (cf. <a href="../../par/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>), for this judgment extends only to the natural life of man. God reserves the final killing to himself at the great judgment day. This is shown in the limitation, "five months." This apparently meaningless period becomes explicable, when we remember that the usual duration of a locust plague is <span class="accented">five months</span>, viz. from April to September. The visitation is for the natural period of such occurrences; the torment is to extend to the natural period of man's sojourn on the earth. It does not extend into the next life; other and special means are adopted for man's punishment then, as set forth under the seventh trumpet. Various other explanations have been given of the <span class="accented">five months.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Five years of Gothic rule (Vitringa). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Five months   =   5 &times; 30 days; each day represents one year; therefore 150 years are signified, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> of the Saracens, A.D. 830 - A.D. 980 (Mede); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Mohammed's conquests, A.D. 612 - A.D. 762 (Elliott). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hengstenberg believes 5 to signify a part of the complete number 10, and thus to symbolize an incomplete period, as compared with the period of the seventh trumpet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Bengel, following the principles assumed by him, makes the <span class="accented">five months</span> to equal 79 natural years, and assigns the period to A.D.  - A.D. 589. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Others take the expression to mean "a short time" merely. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Wordsworth interprets it as meaning a limited time permitted by God, and thinks the Mohammedan period is signified, and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. "Their torment," that is, the torment of the unsealed, according to Alford; the torment of the locusts (viz. that which they inflict), according to others. In either ease the meaning is the same. The last clause, "when he striketh a man," is perhaps added in contradistinction to the injury naturally inflicted by locusts, whose efforts are directed against the vegetation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-6.htm">Revelation 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them;</span> <span class="accented">shall in no wise find it</span>...  <span class="accented">and death fleeth from them</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "the men;" that is, the unsealed, who suffer this judgment. This is a characteristic biblical method of expressing great anguish. Thus <a href="../../par/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20, 21</a>, "The bitter in soul; which long for death, but it cometh not" (cf. also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-3.htm">Jeremiah 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>; and <a href="../../par/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>). The description portrays great anguish of mind, and should not be pressed to a literal interpretation, though many have illustrated the passage by pointing to actual occurrences of the kind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the shapes of the locusts <i>were</i> like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads <i>were</i> as it were crowns like gold, and their faces <i>were</i> as the faces of men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the likenesses of the locusts</span>; that is to say, the general appearance. This similarity is brought out in <a href="../../par/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>, and is alluded to in <a href="../../par/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>. The parallel is worked out at some length in Tristram's 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 314. In what way they appeared "prepared unto battle," is shown in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">And on their heads were as it were crowns like gold;</span> <span class="accented">crowns like unto gold.</span> The language is carefully guarded so as to make it understood that this feature is altogether supernatural. The <span class="accented">crowns</span> of <span class="accented">gold</span> probably denote the conquering nature of the locusts, and thus they add to the power with which the locusts have already been invested. They may also signify the exalted temporal position of those symbolized by the locusts. Some writers believe the helmets of soldiers are typified, and others the turbans of the Mohammedans. <span class="cmt_word">And their faces were as the faces of men.</span> Notwithstanding the general resemblance of the locusts to horses, which resemblance is most clearly shadowed forth in the structure of the head, yet their faces gave the seer the idea of the human countenance. How this was brought about we are not told. Probably St. John himself in his vision received the impression without knowing by what means. The circumstance seems to point decidedly to the fact that human agents are denoted by the locusts..

The antennae of the insect are probably referred to. Wordsworth sees here an allusion to the flowing hair of Mohammed and the Saracens. And their teeth were as the teeth of lions. The powerful nature of the teeth of the locust is a remarkable feature of the insect; and it is here more fully referred to in order to enhance the general terror of their aspect (cf. <a href="../../par/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-10.htm">Revelation 9:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power <i>was</i> to hurt men five months.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails;</span> <span class="accented">and they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings</span> (Revised Version). The next words are included in the following clause. Not that their tails possessed the appearance of scorpions (as Bengel, Hengstenberg, and others), but that their tails were like the tails of scorpions in respect of having stings in them. Cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-34.htm">2 Samuel 22:34</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-33.htm">Psalm 18:33</a>, "He maketh my feet like hands" (omit "feet"); also <a href="../../par/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a>, "Two horns like a lamb" (see the description of the scorpion quoted above, under ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">And their power was to hurt men five months;</span> <span class="accented">and in their tails is their power to hurt</span>, etc. (Revised Version) (see the preceding clause). As no Greek manuscript gives the reading of the Textus Receptus followed by the Authorized Version, the probability is that this is an example of a passage in which the Greek of his edition was supplied by Erasmus, by the simple process of retranslating into Greek the Vulgate Version. By the possession of the noxious sting, the locusts here described are represented as being yet more terrible than the natural locusts. (See the description of the locusts given under ver. 3. For the signification of the "five months," see on ver. 5.) They limit the period of this judgment to the time of man's existence on this earth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a></div><div class="verse">And they had a king over them, <i>which is</i> the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue <i>is</i> Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath <i>his</i> name Apollyon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">they have over them as king the angel of the abyss</span> (Revised Version). Most commentators contrast with the condition of the natural locusts, who have no king (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7</a>). "The angel" evidently, points to the star of ver. l, who is Satan himself. Some think a particular angel, not Satan, is intended. Alford unnecessarily hesitates to decide that Satan is meant, owing to <a href="../../par/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3, 9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</span> <span class="accented">Abaddon</span> is the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, a noun representing the abstract idea "destruction" (<a href="../../par/job/31-12.htm">Job 31:12</a>), but more frequently employed to designate the netherworld (<a href="../../par/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-22.htm">Job 28:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-12.htm">Psalm 88:12</a>). Apollyon (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, present participle) is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (by which the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) personified. It is in conformity with St. John's usual practice to give the two forms of the name (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-13.htm">John 19:13, 17</a>). In the name we have summed up the character of him who bears it. He is the "destroyer," the one who causes "perdition" to mankind. Cf. the words of our Lord given by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), "He was a murderer from the beginning." Bengel and others contrast with "Jesus" the "Saviour." Perhaps the height of absurdity is reached by those writers (Bleek, Volkmar) who see in the name Apollyon a reference to (N)apoleon.

Some are obviously absurd; in all these is considerable doubt and difficulty. The following is offered as a possible solution to some extent, though it is not pretended that every difficulty is satisfactorily disposed cf. In making this suggestion, the following circumstances have been borne in mind: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The trumpet visions seem constructed upon a systematic plan, and therefore it seems likely that this judgment, like the fifth and the seventh, is a spiritual one (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The objects of this punishment are those who commit the sins described in vers. 20, 21. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The vision must have borne some meaning for these to whom it was first delivered. It seems unlikely, therefore, that events are here portrayed which could not possibly have been foreseen and understood by the early Christians. This seems to exclude (except possibly in a secondary sense) all reference to the papacy, etc. (as Wordsworth). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Whether the angels here described are good angels or bad angels makes no material difference to the main part of the vision, which is to set forth punishment for the ungodly, sanctioned or originated by God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The object of the punishment is to bring men to repentance, but it largely fails to do so (ver. 21). We therefore conclude that the whole judgment portrays the spiritual evils which afflict the ungodly in this life, and which give them, as it were, a foretaste of their doom in the life to come. Sin frequently brings unrest and trouble immediately in its train; seldom, if ever, peace and satisfaction. The stings of sin are, perhaps, none the less potent because their effect is frequently unseen by the general public. The terror of the murderer, the shame of the thief, the abasement and physical suffering of the impure, the <span class="accented">delirium tremens</span> of the drunkard, are very real torments. The number of such inflictions is, indeed, great enough to be described as "two myriads of myriads" (ver. 16): they destroy a part, but not the greater part (ver. 15, "the third part") of men; and yet how largely they fail to bring men to repentance! Such punishment is a foretaste of hell, as seems to be foreshadowed in the "fire and smoke and brimstone" of vers. 17, 18. Wordsworth and others contend that the "four angels" are good angels, who have been hitherto restrained. As remarked above, the point is not a material one, but it seems more probable that evil angels are intended. Their loosing does not necessarily mean that they are loosed at a time subsequent to this vision, but only that they are under the control of God, Who allows them freedom to carry out this mission. Thus also, in the case of the other judgments, it has been pointed out that the period of their operation may extend throughout all ages, from the beginning to the end of the world. They arise from the <span class="accented">Euphrates.</span> Many writers point out that this river was looked upon by the Israelites as the natural source from which sprang their enemies (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>). Indeed, the Euphrates was looked upon as the boundary of the Jewish kingdom (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-9.htm">1 Chronicles 5:9</a>); hence those coming from out of the Euphrates were frequently enemies. The expression may be merely accessory to the general filling up of the picture, or it may teach us that the punishments which follow flow from their natural source, viz. men's sins (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>, where the Euphrates is certainly alluded to as the source from whence arise hostile hosts). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-15.htm">Revelation 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. The alterations in the Revised Version make the meaning much plainer: <span class="accented">which had been prepared for the bout, and day, and month, and year, that they should kill</span>, etc. That is to say those "which had" in God's foreknowledge "been prepared" in order to operate at the exact period required - the exact <span class="accented">year, month, day</span>, and even <span class="accented">hour.</span> Each knew his appointed time. <span class="accented">Four</span> is the number used to denote universality in things of this world (see on Revelation 4:6). The number, therefore, seems to imply that the power of the angels is of universal extent. The <span class="accented">third part</span> are destroyed; that is, a great part, though not the larger (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-16.htm">Revelation 9:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the number of the army of the horsemen <i>were</i> two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - And the number of the army of the horsemen; <span class="accented">and the number of the armies of the cavalry.</span> No horsemen have hitherto been Minded to; but they are apparently the destroying host under the direction of the four angels. The symbol is, no doubt, chosen to signify power, of which horsemen or cavalry are an emblem. Were two hundred thousand thousand; or, <span class="accented">twice myriads of myriads</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14-16</a>, which is a quotation from Enoch; also <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). The number is, of course, not to be taken literally, but as signifying an exceeding great multitude. <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the number of them.</span> Omit "and." St. John "heard the number" possibly from one of the elders, who had before instructed him (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13</a>). He states this, since so vast a multitude would be innumerable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a></div><div class="verse">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses <i>were</i> as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them.</span> That is, according to the description following, not "thus, in such numbers as I have described." <span class="cmt_word">Having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having," probably refers to both horses and riders, though it may refer to the riders only. The Revised Version renders <span class="accented">jacinth</span> more exactly as <span class="accented">hyacinth.</span> Alford translates, "breastplates, fiery red, fuliginous, and sulphureous." It seems to be rightly concluded that the <span class="accented">hyacinhine</span> hue answers to the "smoke" further on in the verse. "The expression, 'of jacinth,' applied to the breastplate, is descriptive simply of a <span class="accented">hyacinthine, i.e.</span> dark-purple colour" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible'). The description intensifies the terrible nature of the vision, and it is doubtful whether these details should be pressed to a particular interpretation. If they bear any meaning at all, they seem to point to the doom in wait for the wicked, whose portion is fire and brimstone (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone;</span> <span class="accented">proceedeth fire</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Here, as in the preceding clause, the intention is evidently to enhance the terrible appearance of the vision. The "smoke" corresponds to the <span class="accented">hyacinth</span> hue, mentioned in the previous part of the verse (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). The horses, in accordance with a well-known poetic figure, are said to breathe out "fire and smoke." Brimstone is mentioned in addition, in order to set forth plainly the fact that their acts are directed against the wicked (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/17-29.htm">Luke 17:29</a>). Lions' teeth are mentioned in the description of tire locusts, with the same purpose (ver. 9). It is difficult to see why Alford should imagine that the <span class="accented">fire, smoke</span>, and <span class="accented">brimstone</span> proceed separately from different divisions of the host: it was not so in the case of the breastplates. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-18.htm">Revelation 9:18</a></div><div class="verse">By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths;</span> <span class="accented">by</span> <span class="accented">these three plagues</span> (as in Revised Version)... <span class="accented">the brimstone, which proceeded.</span> Although the last clause technically is attached to "brimstone" only, yet the description applies to all three of the things mentioned. "The third part" again a large, but not the largest, part of mankind (see on Revelation 8:7). The locusts were forbidden to <span class="accented">kill</span> (ver. 5); these horsemen are permitted to do so. Each judgment of the trumpet visions appears t) increase in severity. We may here see portrayed the terrible and destructive character of the results of sin. Such results are experienced to the full by the <span class="accented">third</span> part of men, the large class who" repent not of their murders, nor of their sorceries," etc. (ver. 21). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-19.htm">Revelation 9:19</a></div><div class="verse">For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails <i>were</i> like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails; <span class="accented">for the power f the horses is</span>, etc. Another example of disagreement between Erasmus and all the Greek manuscripts (see on ver. 10). For their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. "Are like," and "have heads," in the present tense. Here (unlike ver. 10) the tails are like serpents themselves. The image is not uncommon among the ancients. We may paraphrase the passage thus: "Their power is for the most part in their mouth; but also, to some extent, in their tails; for their tails are like serpents," etc. An endless variety of interpretations have been given to these details, which are probably not intended to bear any distinct signification. Bengel refers to a species of serpent in which the head and tail were so alike as to be with difficulty distinguished; which he thinks may have suggested the image. Many apply it (though in different ways) to the Turkish horse, who fight as they retreat, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a></div><div class="verse">And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues;</span> <span class="accented">the rest of mankind</span> (Revised Version). That is, the two thirds (ver. 18). Some understand "these plagues" to refer to the first six trumpets. It may be so, but it seems more correct to limit it to the sixth, as the same phrase, which occurs in ver. 18, must be so limited. <span class="accented">Mankind</span> must be taken to mean the worldly only. Of the ungodly, some are killed (the third part), the rest yet do not repent. The vision is not concerned with the fate of the righteous. <span class="cmt_word">Yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk.</span> "The works of their hands" refers to idolatry, as shown by the succeeding words. This verse begins to prepare us for the seventh judgment. Men will not repent; therefore the last final judgment becomes necessary. The absurdity of idolatrous worship is frequently thus set forth by Old Testament writers (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-1.htm">Ezekiel 22:1, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>). See also the description in <a href="../../par/daniel/5-23.htm">Daniel 5:23</a> which seems to have suggested the wording of this part of the vision. It has been well remarked that in this verse mention is made of sins against God; in the following verse man's sins against his neighbours are detailed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a></div><div class="verse">Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</span> <span class="accented">Sorceries</span>; magic, witchcraft, and enchantments; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the magic of the Egyptian magicians (<a href="../../par/exodus/7-22.htm">Exodus 7:22</a>).
