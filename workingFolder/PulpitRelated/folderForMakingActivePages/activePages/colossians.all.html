The apostle designates himself by his <span class="accented">office</span>, as always, except in the Macedonian Epistles and the letter of private friendship to Philemon. Timothy shares also in the greeting of the Epistle to Philemon, probably a leading member of the Colossian Church (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-9.htm">Colossians 4:9, 17</a> with <a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2, 10-12</a>). During St. Paul's long residence at Ephesus Timothy was with him (<a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>), and there, probably, Philemon had come under his influence (see Introduction, &sect; 2), and made Timothy's acquaintance. There was, therefore, at least one link of acquaintance between "Timothy the brother" and "the saints in Colossae" (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; 1 and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>, where his name appears in the same way).

The omission is well established (see Revised Text, and critical editors generally), and cannot surely be accidental. In this and the twin Ephesian letter, devoted as they are to the glory of Christ, the name of <span class="accented">the Father</span> stands out with a peculiar prominence and dignity, much as in St. John's Gospel: "honouring the Son," they must needs "honour the Father" also (vers. 12, 13; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>).

The Revised Text omits "and" between" God" and "Father," following Lachmann, Westcott and Heft, and Lightfoot (who hesitates), on evidence numerically slight, but sufficient; especially as in every other instance of this combination the conjunction is present. "Father" is also without definite article in the better attested (Revised) reading. The words, "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," bear, therefore, an explanatory, quasi-predicative force. St. Paul wishes his readers to understand that he gives thanks to God on their account distinctly under this aspect, regarded as <span class="accented">"Father</span> of Christ." He has just spoken <span class="accented">of "our</span> Father," and now adds, "Father of our Lord Jesus <span class="accented">Christ,"</span> suggesting that it is in this relation that we know God as <span class="accented">"our</span> Father," the Author of grace and peace, the Object of Christian thanksgiving. So the sovereign and exclusive mediation of Christ, the ruling idea of the whole Epistle, is thrown into bold relief at the outset; and, in this light, the unique omissions of vers. 2 and 3 explain and justify each other. This fatherhood embraces the entire Person and offices of the Son as "our Lord Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Praying always for you</span> (ver. 9; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>). The apostle had known from the first of the existence of this Church; and had already been in communication with it (see Introduction, &sect; 2). He had, therefore, a general prayerful interest in the Colossians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>), that has been quickened to joyful thanksgiving (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6-10</a>) by the arrival of Epaphras. "Always" and <span class="accented">"for</span> you" - either or both of the phrases  - may be joined grammatically to <span class="accented">"we</span> give thanks" or to "praying:" the latter connection is preferable (see Alford or Ellicott); similarly in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-4.htm">Philemon 1:4</a>; in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a> the turn of expression is different.

In the Epistles of this period the Christian state appears chiefly as "life in Christ;" rather than, as in the earlier letters, as "salvation through Christ" (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>. and <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). The "love" of the Colossians evokes thanksgiving, as that which they have "toward all the saints;" for as the Church extended Christian love needed to be more catholic (ver. 6; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), and Colossian error in particular tended to exclusiveness and caste feeling (see note on ver. 28). The iteration of "all" in this Epistle is remarkable.

St. Paul speaks most of <span class="accented">heaven</span> and <span class="accented">heavenly things</span> in the letters of this period. Ver. 4 gives the nearest grammatical connection for this clause; and many recent commentators, following Greek interpreters, accordingly find here that which "evokes and conditions" the Colossians' "love" (Meyer, Ellicott) or "faith and love" (De Wette, Lightfoot). But this construction we reject. For it makes the heavenly reward the reason of the Colossians' present (faith and) love, reversing the true and Pauline order of thought (<a href="../../par/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17, 18</a>); while, on the other hand, the heavenly hope is the last and highest ground of the apostle's thanksgivings and encouragements, and the forfeiture or impairing of it the chief matter of his fears and warnings throughout the Epistles of this group (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 22, 23, 27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11-21</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>). It is better, therefore, with Bengel, Hofmann, Klopper, Conybeare, Eadie, and others, from Athanasius downwards, to refer ver. 5 as well as ver. 4 to the principal verb, "we give thanks" (ver. 3). What the apostle hears of "the faith and love" of the Colossian brethren moves him to give thanks for "the hope which is in store for them in heaven." Of that hope this faith and love are to him a pledge and an earnest, even as the "seal of the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>) and the "peace of Christ in their hearts" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; see note) are to themselves. Similarly, in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a> and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4, 5</a>, from the present faith and patience of the saints the certainty of their future blessedness is argued. By singling out this <span class="accented">hope</span> as chief matter of thanksgiving here, the apostle enhances its certainty and its value in his readers' eyes. (On this verse, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 74-80.) From the <span class="accented">general occasion and ground</span> of his thanksgiving in the Christian state and prospects of his readers, St. Paul proceeds to dwell on certain <span class="accented">special circumstances</span> which enhanced his gratitude to God (vers. 56-8). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (hope) <span class="cmt_word">ye heard of before, in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span> or, <span class="accented">good tidings</span> (vers. 7, 23; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). There is a veiled polemic reference in "the word of <span class="accented">the truth</span> of the gospel" (comp. ver. 7 and parallels from Galatians). The word "before" (<span class="accented">aforetime</span>) "contrasts their earlier with their later lessons, the true gospel of Epaphras with the false gospel of recent teachers" (Lightfoot). Others interpret, less suitably: <span class="accented">heard already</span> (<span class="accented">before my writing</span>), or <span class="accented">heard beforehand</span> (<span class="accented">before the fulfilment of the hope</span>). It is in St. Paul's manner to refer his readers at the outset to their conversion and first Christian experiences (see parallel passages). Their <span class="accented">hope</span> was directly at stake in the controversy with Colossian error. Here we meet the first of those cumulative combinations of nouns, so marked a feature of the style of Colossians and Ephesians, which are made a reproach against these Epistles by some critics; but each is appropriate in its place.

The words, "and increasing," are added to the text on the testimony, all but unanimous, of the older witnesses. Their propriety is manifest; for the success of the gospel at Colossae was a gratifying evidence, both of its inherent fruitfulness, and of its rapid progress in the Gentile world. Stationary at Rome (see Introduction, &sect; 3), and with his messengers coming and going, and news reaching him from time to time of the advance of the Christian cause, the strong expression, "in all the world," is natural to St. Paul.

For their progress had been continuous (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>).

Only in <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> does the epithet "fellow-bondman" appear again in St. Paul (the Revisers in these two places omit their marginal "bondservant"). The dominant thought of Christ Jesus "the Lord" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-4:1</a>) possibly dictates this expression. That the Colossians had received the gospel in this way from Epaphras, a disciple of St. Paul, was a striking proof of its fruitfulness, and a further cause for thanksgiving on his own part. <span class="cmt_word">Who is a faithful minister of Christ on our (or, <span class="accented">your</span>) behalf</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-22.htm">2 Corinthians 8:22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). He puts his seal upon the ministry of Epaphras, and vindicates it against all questioning at home. Textual evidence for "on our" or "your behalf" is pretty evenly balanced: most older Greek copies read the first person, while the ancient versions generally adopted the second; and the critical editors are similarly divided. The Revisers, with Tregelles, Alford, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, prefer "our," which gives a finer and more fitting sense. It was as St. Paul's representative that Epaphras had ministered in Colossae, and to him he now reported his success; and this justified the apostle in claiming the Colossians as his own charge, and in writing to them in the terms of this letter (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1, 2, 5-7</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13-16</a>).

Epaphras had conveyed the blessings of the gospel from St. Paul to the Colossians, and they now send back the grateful assurance of their love by the same channel (comp, note on "having heard," ver. 4, and parallel passages). This was a choice fruit of the gospel in them (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10, 15-18</a>), and such a reference to it gives a kindly conclusion to the thanksgiving. Ellicott and others understand here <span class="accented">brotherly love in general</span> - a somewhat pointless repetition of ver. 4.

The <span class="accented">Spirit</span> is the ruling element of the Colossians' love (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) Love-in-the-Sprat forms a single compound phrase, like "faith-in-Christ-Jesus" (ver. 4). The one <span class="accented">Spirit</span> dwells alike in all the members of Christ's body, however sundered by place or circumstance (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-4</a>), and makes them one in love to each other as to him (<a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23, 24</a>). "Spirit" occurs besides in this Epistle only in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a> (but see "spiritual," ver. 9), and some find in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1, 5</a> the explanation of this phrase (<span class="accented">sc.</span> "a love formed in absence, without personal intercourse:" but this is forced, and doubtful in point of grammar). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - The <span class="accented">opening prayer</span> rises out of the foregoing thanksgiving, and leads up to the chief doctrinal statement of the Epistle (vers. 15-20: compare, for the connection, <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8-17</a>).

The "redemption of the body" (also <span class="accented">bought</span> by the same <span class="accented">price</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>) will make the work complete (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). Lightfoot suggests that the apostle intends to contradict the doctrine of redemption taught by the Gnostics, who made it consist in initiation into their "mysteries" (see note on ver. 27); and supposes that this notion may already have existed at Colossae in some incipient form. But such an abuse of the term seems to imply a well established and familiar Christian use. Philo, who speaks the language of the Jewish philosophic mysticism of the first century, has no such usage. In firm, clear lines the apostle has retraced, in vers. 12-14 (comp. vers. 20-23; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-14</a>), the teaching of his earlier Epistles on the doctrines of salvation. Here he assumes, in brief and comprehensive terms, what in writing to the Galatians and Romans he had formerly been at so much pains to prove.

The Pauline doctrine of the Church as the body of Christ is developed in Colossians and Ephesians, especially in the later Epistle, where it receives its fruitful application. Here the doctrine of the Person of Christ and the doctrine of the Church find their meeting-point as mutually implying each other, and together opposed to the double effect of early Gnosticism, which tended first to lower the dignity of Christ, and then to impair the unity of his Church (see <a href="../../par/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, note). In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4, 5</a> the figure of the <span class="accented">body and members</span> is merely a passing illustration of the mutual relation of believers in the Church; now <span class="accented">the body of Christ</span> becomes the formal title of the Church, expressing the fundamental and fixed conception of its nature as related to him, who is the centre of its unity, the source of all vital energy and directing control within it (comp. the <span class="accented">vine and branches</span>, <a href="../../par/john/15.htm">John 15</a>.). In vers. 16, 17 the writer passed from the thought of the origin to that of the constitution of the cosmos; now he proceeds in the reverse order.

As explained by the following words, it denotes, as in philosophical Greek, a <span class="accented">first principle, originating cause, fens et origo</span> (see Lightfoot's note and references). To borrow "of the dead" from the following parallel clause weakens the force of both. His body, the Church, <span class="accented">begins</span> in him, dating and deriving from him its "all in all" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This is quite consistent with the "all things are of God" of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; for the apostle is thinking here of the relative, historical beginning of <span class="accented">"the</span> kingdom of the Son" (ver. 13), there of the absolute beginning of the Divine work of redemption (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; and note on "unto him," ver. 16).

The apostle derives the whole life and power of Christianity, whether as seen in Christ or proved by his people, from his resurrection (see parallels). The name <span class="accented">Firstborn</span> brings over with it into this verse the glory which surrounds it in ver. 15. The Divine Firstborn, who is before and over all things, wins his title a second time for his earthly brethren's sake (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10-15</a>).

The combination of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("being") with perfect passive participle ("having been alienated") implies a fixed condition, that has become as a part of one's nature (so in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, Revised Text). As the opposite of "reconciled," "alienated" is strictly passive, and denotes, not a subjective feeling on the part of the sinner, but an objective determination on the part of God, an exclusion from the Divine favour, from "the kingdom of the Son" and "the lot of the saints" (vers. 12, 13; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3, 11-13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>: comp. usage of LXX in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9; 1</a> Esdr. 9:4; Sir. 11:34). "Enemies in your thought" sets forth the disposition of the sinner towards God (<a href="../../par/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18</a>: so Alford,Ellicott, Lightfoot). Meyer maintains the passive sense of "enemies," as found in <a href="../../par/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>. On the latter view, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> is instrumental dative, "by," "in virtue of your state of mind;" on the former, it is dative of reference or definition. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (here only and <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a> and Ephesians 4:18 in St. Paul) has possibly a polemical reference. It denotes in Greek philosophy, the faculty of <span class="accented">thought</span>, as opposed to the bodily powers. In Philo's teaching it signifies the higher part of human nature, akin to God, and opposed to evil which belongs to the senses: "Thought (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the best thing in us" ('On Fugitives,' &sect; 26); "Every man in regard to his intellect (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is united to the Divine Word, being an impression or fragment or ray of that blessed nature; but in respect of his body he belongs to the entire world" ('On the Creation of the World,' &sect; 51). But here sin is associated With <span class="accented">the intellect in</span> man, and redemption with "the body of Christ's flesh" (ver. 22): comp. notes on "reason," <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>, and "body," <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; also <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, where <span class="accented">the reason</span> is vain, <span class="accented">the intellect</span> darkened. "Wicked [emphasized by its position in the Greek, denoting <span class="accented">active</span> evil; see Trench's 'Synonyms,' on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>] works" is a phrase common in St. John, only used here by St. Paul (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). These <span class="accented">works</span> are the practices of life in which the sinner is abidingly excluded from "the kingdom of Christ and God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>), and manifests the radical antipathy of his mind toward God. "Yet [or, 'but'] now:" comp. ver. 26; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, etc. - a lively form of transition characteristic of St. Paul, primarily temporal, then also logical in sense. "Were ye reconciled" breaks through the grammatical structure of the sentence, as in vers. 26, 27 (see Lightfoot, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 717). If "did he reconcile" (or, "hath he reconciled") be the correct reading, "Christ" is still subject of the verb, as in vers. 19-22, and consistently with <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>. (On "reconcile," see ver. 20.)

With a significant emphasis, the material body of Christ is made the instrument of that reconciliation in the carrying out of which "his whole fulness" is engaged (vers. 19, 20); see note on "thought," ver. 21, and on "body," <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. The necessity of the double expression was shown by the fact that the Gnostic Marcion erased "of his flesh" from the text of this Epistle, and interpreted "the body" as "the Church;" Bengel and others suppose "of his flesh "to be added to prevent this mistake (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:19). This phrase was the crux of Docetism, whose principles were indeed implicitly contained in the Alexandrine-Jewish philosophy with its contempt for matter and the physical life, which was now first beginning to leaven the Church. <span class="accented">Body</span> is antithetical to <span class="accented">soul: flesh</span> to <span class="accented">spirit.</span> The former is individual and concrete, the actual physical organism; the latter denotes the material of which it consists, the bodily nature in its essence and characteristics (comp. note on ver. 11; and see Cremer's 'Lexicon' on these words). "In the body" is not "by the body," nor "during his earthly life" (as though opposed to "out of the body," <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-3.htm">2 Corinthians 12:3</a>), but "as incarnate."

So, in general, Meyer and Alford. Ellicott and Lightfoot refer to <span class="accented">God's present approbations</span>, quoting <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, a parallel much less close than ver. 27, and supposing "God" the subject of the verb (see note on ver. 19). "Holy erga Deum; <span class="accented">without blemish</span> respectu vestri; <span class="accented">unreprovable</span> respectu proximi" (Bengel). (On "holy," see note, ver. 2; also <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>.)

In the LXX it is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">tamim</span> ("integer"), "faultless" in bodily condition or in moral character.

As present indicative, it implies a (supposed) actual state. "The faith," as regularly in the New Testament, is the act and exercise of faith (subjective), not the content or matter of faith (objective). "Grounded" or "founded," perfect passive, implies a fixed condition (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>, coupled with "rooted;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; also <a href="../../par/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>).

(<span class="accented">The gospel</span>) which you heard (vers. 5, 7: notes), which was preached in all creation that is under the heaven (ver. 6; <a href="../../par/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>). The transition from "you" to "all creation" resembles that of vers. 5, 6 (comp. vers. 20, 21). "Preached" is literally" heralded," "loudly and officially announced;" so, frequently in St. Paul (see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>), also in <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. Greek usage does not support the interpretation which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("creation ") equivalent to "humanity." This sense of the word, which, even in Mark, such interpreters as Bengel, Lange, Alford, reject, is quite Hebraistic and exceptional. The phrase, "all creation," the writer has already used in ver. 15; here, as there (see here), without the article (Revised Text). The universal meaning it carries there is now limited by "under the heaven." The <span class="accented">earthly creation</span> subject as it is to Christ, is the sphere of this proclamation, the <span class="accented">preaching room</span> which is to resound everywhere with the glad tidings (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>). And with this range it <span class="accented">was proclaimed</span>, for from the first it claimed universal audience. Whereof I became, I Paul, a minister (vers. 24-29; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15-19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1, 2, 16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1-10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16-18</a>). (For "minister," see ver. 7.) The later Epistles betray a markedly heightened sense in the apostle of the unique dignity and importance of his own position, and those who question their authenticity press this fact against them. But the difference of tone is what one would expect in "such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>). As the Gentile Churches grew, reverence for his person deepened; and the success of his life mission became more assured, especially now that the struggle with reactionary Judaism, signalized by the Epistles of the third missionary journey, was to a large extent decided in his favour. The false teachers he is now opposing did not, we should gather, attack the apostle personally; but may rather have claimed to be on his side. The movement of thought we have followed in vers. 15-23 proceeds from <span class="accented">Christ's redeeming work</span> to <span class="accented">the experience of the Colossians</span> in receiving it, and <span class="accented">the labours of the apostle</span> in publishing it; and is parallel to that of <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-3:13</a>.

Christ, the Head, had borne his part, now the apostle in turn fills up his part, in the great sum of suffering to be undergone on behalf of the body of Christ (see parallels). The verb being so understood, then, with Lightfoot, we infer that "the afflictions of Christ" (a phrase peculiar. . to this passage). are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Christ's own ministerial sufferings</span>, endured at the hands of men. <span class="accented">Affliction</span> is a common term for all that Christians suffer as being in "this present evil world" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4-6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).

It is worthy of note that, unless it be in the Epistle to the Hebrews, St. Paul never uses the words "suffer," "suffering" (much less "affliction") in connection with the atoning sacrifice. He dwells rather on the objective fact itself - "the death," "the cross," "the blood." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The prevailing interpretation (Chrysostom, Augustine, down to Alford, Ellicott) finds here <span class="accented">the afflictions of the Church</span> (including Paul's) <span class="accented">made Christ's by mystic sympathy</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23, 29</a>). But this view identifies Paul's sufferings with his Master's, while he expressly distinguishes them; and the idea, however beautiful in itself, is without Pauline analogy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Meyer holds the afflictions to be <span class="accented">Paul's own afflictions which are Christ's by ethical identity, as</span> belonging to the same class.

Dr. Gloag, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 7. pp. 224-236, fully discusses the passage and ably defends (3). <span class="cmt_word">In my flesh</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>); for St. Paul's physical nature felt keenly the pangs of imprisonment, the chafing of "these bonds." And thus he puts honour on the despised <span class="accented">flesh</span>, as capable of such high service (see note, ver. 22)<span class="cmt_word">. On behalf of his body, which is the Church</span> (ver. 18; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). The interests of the Church demanded his sufferings. They are "for you" (Colossian Gentiles); but, in his view, the full possession of the gospel by the Gentiles and the existence of the Church itself were vitally bound up together (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). If "Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for her" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>), he might well in his turn suffer on the same account. The magnitude of the interests involved are measured by his greatness whose body the Church is (vers. 15-18). (On "body," see note, ver. 18 .)

In this office he "administers the gospel" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17, 18</a>), "the grace of God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>), and here more especially "the mystery" of vers. 26, 27 (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, R.V.).

Some interpreters connect "to you-ward" with the word "fulfil," but less suitably (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To fulfil the word of God</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16-19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>). "To fulfil" (see vers. 9, 24, and "fulness," ver. 19; also <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>) is either "to complete," to give full development and extension to the gospel message (vers. 5, 6; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 21, 27</a>); or "to accomplish" the prophetic word (<a href="../../par/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24-26</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8 - 12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15-17</a>), as in <a href="../../par/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>, and frequently in the Gospels.

The word "mystery" plays a large part in Colossians and Ephesians. It occurs in 1 Corinthians, and twice in the Roman Epistle, written from Corinth. Its use in <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a> is identical with that of the passage before us. The Greek <span class="accented">mysteries</span> were secret religious doctrines and rites made known only to initiated persons, who formed associations statedly assembling at certain sacred spots, of which Eleusis near Athens was the most famous. These systems exercised a vast influence over the Greek mind, and Greek literature is full of allusions to them; but their secret has been well kept, and little is known of their real character. Some of these mystic systems, probably, inculcated doctrines of a purer and more spiritual type than those of the vulgar polytheism. The ascetic and mystical doctrines ascribed to Pythagoras were propagated by secret societies. The language and ideas connected with the mysteries were readily adopted by the Jewish Broad Church of Alexandria, whose endeavour it was to expand Judaism by a symbolical and allegorizing method into a philosophic and universal religious system, and who were compelled to veil their inner doctrine from the eyes of their stricter, unenlightened (or unsophisticated) fellowbelievers. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> appears in the Apocrypha as an epithet of the Divine Wisdom (Wisd. 2:22 Wisd. 8:4; etc.): <a href="../../par/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>) furnished the Old Testament basis of this usage. (See Philo, 'On the Cherubim,' &sect; 12; 'On Fugitives,' &sect; 16; etc., for the place <span class="accented">of mystery</span> in the Alexandrine theology.) St. Paul, writing to men accustomed, either as Greeks or as Hellenistic Jews, to this phraseology, calls the gospel <span class="accented">"a</span> mystery," as that which <span class="accented">is "hidden</span> from the natural understanding and from the previous searchings of men" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>). But in the words that follow he repudiates the notion of any secrecy or exclusiveness in its proclamation (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12-4:6</a>); in his language, "mystery is the correlate of revelation." The thrice-repeated <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> ("from," "away"), with the double indication of time, "gives a solemn emphasis" (Meyer) to the statement. <span class="accented">Ages</span> are successive epochs of time, with their states and conditions (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>); <span class="accented">generations</span> are successive races of men, with their traditions and hereditary tendencies. But now it was made manifest to his saints (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). The word "reveal" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) indicates a process, "make manifest" points to the result of this Divine act (<a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> with Romans 3:21; see Trench's 'Synonyms'). The transition from the participle in the last clause to the strongly assertive finite verb in this almost disappears in English idiom: comp. vers. 5, 6; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a> (Greek); and see Winer's 'N.T. Grammar,' p. 717, or A. Buttmann, p. 382. There is also a change of tense: the manifestation is a single, sudden event (aorist), breaking through the long and seemingly final concealment of all previous time (present perfect participle); similarly in <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, note). <span class="accented">To his sailors</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Church at large (ver. 2; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>); but this implies a spiritual qualification (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). "His saints" are the recipients; "his <span class="accented">holy</span> apostles and prophets, in the Spirit," the organs (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>) of this manifestation. The Church had long ago formally accepted this revelation (<a href="../../par/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>); it was St. Paul's office to make it practically effectual. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a></div><div class="verse">To whom God would make known what <i>is</i> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the Gentiles</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5-10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11, 12, 25-32</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9-12</a>). "Willed" stands emphatically first in the Greek. The revelation was so momentous in its issue, so signal in its method, and so contrary to human foresight and prejudice, that it proceeded evidently from" the will of God" (vers. 1, 9; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18</a>): "Who was I," said St. Peter, "that I could withstand God?" The Ephesian letter delights to dwell on <span class="accented">God's will</span> as the cause of the whole counsel and work of salvation. The Revisers have rendered the verb by "was pleased," the equivalent of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> (ver. 19; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 9</a>; etc.). There is no need to seek a reference to <span class="accented">free grace</span> in the verb "willed;" the two ideas are concurrent, but distinct (see, however, Lightfoot). The apostle's mind is filled with amazement as he contemplates the boundless <span class="accented">riches</span> which the salvation of the Gentiles revealed in God himself (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8-10</a>). "The glory of this mystery" is the splendour with which it invests the Divine character (on "glory," see note, ver. 11; and for "riches of glory," <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>). <span class="accented">Amongst the Gentiles:</span> "semi-local clause, defining the sphere in which the riches of the glory is more specially evinced" (Ellicott).

By a bold metonymy, the <span class="accented">mystery</span> is identified with its subject or content. It is "Christ" himself (see <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>, note), the Divine secret of the ages, the burden of all revelation; and "Christ in you" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), Christ dwelling in Gentile carts - this is the wonder of wonders! So the "sinners of the Gentiles" receive "the like [equal] gift" with the heirs of the promises (<a href="../../par/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>).

Thrice in this verse "every man" is repeated, and "in all wisdom" follows "teaching" with a marked emphasis. The Colossian errorists, as we should presume from the general tenor and affinities of their system, sought to form an inner mystical school or circle of discipleship within the Church, initiated into a wisdom and holiness supposed to be higher than that attainable by ordinary Christian faith (see note on "mystery," ver. 26; also <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3, 8</a>). <span class="accented">An intellectual caste-feeling</span> (see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>) was springing up in the Church. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a> the apostle denounces the pride of reason which claims "the things of God" as its own; here he denounces the pride of intellect which refuses the knowledge of them to those who stand on a lower level of mental culture.

"Wisdom" here is not subjective, a quality of the apostle (so Meyer, quoting <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>), but objective, the quality of the truth itself (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22-25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we may present every man perfect in Christ</span> (ver. 22; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-7.htm">2 Corinthians 13:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>): the aim alike of Christ's redemption (ver. 22) and of the apostle's ministry. "Perfect" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is a word associated with the Greek mysteries (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>; and quotations in Lightfoot), and in common use denoted "full-grown," "grown men," as opposed to" children "(<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:1</a>). The philosophic Judaists affected this term considerably. Philo frequently distinguishes between the "perfect" or "fully initiated" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), who are admitted to the sight of God, and the "advancing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>), who are candidates for admission to the Divine mysteries; and he makes Jacob a type of the latter, Israel of the former (see 'On Drunkenness,' &sect; 20; 'On Change of Names,' &sect; 3; 'On Agriculture,' &sect;&sect; 36-38). The apostle makes "perfect" designedly parallel to the "holy and without blemish" of ver. 22, holding out a spiritual ideal very different from that of Alexandrine mystics; and declares that it is to be realized "in Christ" (vers. 2, 4), as in ver. 22 it appeared to be wrought "through Christ" and "for Christ" (comp. ver. 16).

The figurative use of "striving" ("agonizing," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "contending in the arena") is only Pauline in the New Testament: comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>; also <a href="../../par/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>; in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a> (R.V.) it is again connected with "toil" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>). We need not, with Meyer and Ellicott, distinguish inward from outward <span class="accented">striving</span> in this word. The apostle's bodily sufferings (ver. 21) and his mental anxiety (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>) alike enter into the mighty struggle which he is maintaining on the Church's behalf, and which strains every fibre of his nature to the utmost (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>). "Striving" implies opponents against whom he contends (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>); "toiling hard," the painful efforts he has to make. In this toll he is divinely sustained, for he "strives according to his [Christ's: comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>] working." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("energy," "operative force," "power in action") - another word of St. Paul's vocabulary (frequent also in Aristotle) - is used by him only of supernatural power, "a working of God," "of Satan" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which worketh in me with power</span> (ver. 11; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>). The "energy of Christ" is such that it "effectually works" in the apostle; the same idea is repeated in noun and verb (ver. 11, note). The verb is middle in voice, as this "working" is that in which the Divine "energy of Christ" puts itself forth and shows what it can do (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3-6</a>); see note on "bearing fruit," ver. 6, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 318 (dynamic middle). So it works unmistakably "in [or, 'with'] power." Never do we find this consciousness of the Divine power dwelling in himself expressed by St. Paul with such joyous confidence as at this period (see <a href="../../par/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9, 20</a>; and comp. note on ver. 23 b). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../philippians/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Philippians 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Philippians 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../colossians/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Colossians 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Colossians 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/colossians/2.htm"><title>Colossians 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/colossians/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/colossians/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/colossians/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../colossians/1.htm" title="Colossians 1">&#9668;</a> Colossians 2 <a href="../colossians/3.htm" title="Colossians 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and <i>for</i> them at Laodicea, and <i>for</i> as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - SECTION IV. THE APOSTLE'S CONCERN FOR THE COLOSSI. AN CHURCH. So far the contents of the letter have been of a general and preparatory character.

The apostle has dwelt at such length and so earnestly upon his own position and responsibilities (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24-29</a>), that the Colossians may feel how real and strong is his interest in their welfare, though personally strangers to him (see next clause). His solicitude for them is in keeping with the toil and strife of his whole ministry. "I would have you know;" a familiar Pauline phrase (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>, etc.). <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("how great') has, perhaps, a slightly exclamatory force, as in <a href="../../par/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5</a> (only other instance of the word in the New Testament), and in classical Greek. For "strife," see note on "striving" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>): the energy and abruptness of language characterizing this second chapter bear witness in the inward wrestling which the Colossian difficulty occasioned in the apostle's mind. (On the close connection of Colossae with Laodicea, comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13-17</a>, notes; also Introduction, &sect; 1.) The danger which had come to a head in Colassae was doubtless threatening its neighbours. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and as many as have not seen my face in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (ver. 5; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>), raise the question whether St. Paul had ever visited Colossae. The language of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see note) raises a strong presumption against his being the founder of this Church, and the narrative of the Acts scarcely admits of any visit to this region in former missionary journeys. Theodoret amongst the Greeks, followed by our own Lardner and a few recent critics, contended that the apostle distinguishes here between Colossians and Laodiceans (or at least the former), and <span class="accented">those who had not seen His face.</span> But the disjunction is grammatically harsh and improbable (see Ellicott). (On the general question, see Introduction, &sect; 2.) The apostle is the more anxious for this endangered Church, as the gifts that his presence might have conveyed (<a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>) were wanting to them. He says, "in flesh," for "in spirit" he is closely united with them (ver. 5; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>).

This combination of "love and knowledge" appears in all St. Paul's letters of this period (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; and contrast <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2, 8-13</a>). "The riches of the full assurance," etc., and "the knowledge of the mystery" are the counterpart of "the riches of the glory of the mystery," of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; the fulness of conviction and completeness of knowledge attainable by the Christian correspond to the full and satisfying character of the revelation he receives in Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-19</a>). (On "understanding," see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>.) "Full assurance," or "conviction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), is a word belonging to St. Luke and St. Paul (with the Epistle to the Hebrews) in the New Testament (not found in classical Greek), and denotes radically "a bringing to fall measure or maturity." Combined with "understanding," it denotes the ripe, intelligent persuasion of one who enters into the whole wealth of the "truth as it is in Jesus" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>, R.V.; also <a href="../../par/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a> and Romans 14:5, for corresponding verb). In this inward "assurance," as in a fortress, the Colossians were to entrench themselves against the attacks of error (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>, and notes). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is either in explanatory apposition to the previous clause, or rather donors the <span class="accented">further purpose</span> for which this wealth of conviction is to be sought: "knowledge of the Divine mystery, knowledge of Christ"  - this is the supreme end, ever leading on and upward, for the pursuit of which all strengthening of heart and understanding are given (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The Revisers have corrected the erroneous "acknowledgment" by their paraphrastic rendering, "that they may know." (On <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 3), see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>.) The object of this knowledge is the great <span class="accented">manifested mystery</span> of God, namely <span class="accented">Christ</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). We confidently accept here the Revised reading, that of nearly all recent textual critics, which omits the words found in the Received Text between "God" and "Christ." There are extant eleven distinct variations of this reading, and that of the Textus Receptus is, to all appearance, the latest and worst; "the passage is altogether an instructive lesson on textual criticism" (Lightfoot, pp. 252, 253; also Westcott and Hort, 'Introduction: Notes on Selected Readings,' pp. 125, 126). The words thus read have been interpreted mystery of the God Christ" (the Latin Hilary, and a few moderns); of the God of Christ" (Meyer, quoting <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>); - both interpretations grammatically correct, but unsuitable here, even if in harmony with Pauline usage elsewhere. Alford omits "of Christ" altogether, distrusting the textual evidence. Meyer objects to the rendering we have followed (that of Ellicott, Lightfoot, Revisers), that the apostle, if this be his meaning, has expressed himself ambiguously; but comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a> (see note); also <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, "The mystery, <span class="accented">who was</span> manifested in flesh."

Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and others make the relative pronoun neuter, referring to "mystery;" but "Christ," the nearer antecedent, is preferable (vers. 9, 10; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16, 17, 19</a>). <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">him</span> the apostle finds what false teachers sought elsewhere, a satisfaction for the intellect as well as for the heart - <span class="accented">treasures of wisdom and knowledge</span> to enrich the understanding, and unsearchable mysteries to exercise the speculative reason. "Hidden" is, therefore, a secondary predicate: in whom are these treasures, - as hidden treasures" (Ellicott, Lightfoot). (For a similar emphasis of position, compare "made complete," ver. 10, and "seated," <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>.) Meyer and Alford, with the Vulgate, make "hidden" an attributive: "in whom are hidden treasures." Chrysostom and leading versions make it primary predicate: "in whom are hidden," etc., against the order of the words. This word also belongs to the dialect of the mystic theosophists (see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1-11</a>).

This verse is, therefore, the prelude of the impending attack on the false teachers (vers. 8-23). <span class="cmt_word">This I say, that no one may be deluding you in persuasive speech</span> (vers. 8, 18, 23; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). This was the danger which made a more adequate comprehension of Christianity so necessary to the Colossians (vers. 2, 3). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, one of the numerous <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span> of this Epistle (words only used here in the New Testament), compounds into one word the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> ("persuasive words") of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a> (compare "word of wisdom," ver. 23). In classical writers it denotes plausible, <span class="accented">ad captandum</span> reasoning. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (only here and <a href="../../par/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> in the New Testament) is "to use bad logic," "to play off fallacies (paralogisms)." The new teachers were fluent, specious reasoners, and had a store of sophistical arguments at command. The tense of the verb indicates an apprehension as to what may be now <span class="accented">going on</span> (vers. 8, 16, 18, 20; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>). We shall see afterwards (vers. 8-23) what was the doctrine underlying this "persuasive speech." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if indeed I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>). The connection of this verse with the last is not obvious. Ellicott, following Chrysostom, makes St. Paul's spiritual presence the reason for his being able to give the Colossians this warning; Meyer, his bodily absence the reason for their needing it. It is better, with Lightfoot, to see here a general explanatory reference to the previous context, a renewed declaration (ver. 1) of watchful interest in these distant brethren and a hearty acknowledgment of their Christian loyalty. The tone of authoritative warning just assumed (ver. 4) is thus justified, and yet softened (compare the apologetic tone of <a href="../../par/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14, 15</a>). The phrase, "if I am absent," does not imply a previous <span class="accented">presence</span> (see note, ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ</span> (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4-8, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). St. Paul dos not say, "rejoicing in beholding." The consciousness of union with brethren far away, whom he has never seen (ver. 1), is itself a joy; and this joy is heightened by what he sees through the eyes of Epaphras (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 6-8</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>) of the condition of this Church. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are military terms, denoting the "ordered array" and "solid front" of an army prepared for battle (Lightfoot, Hofmann): comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>. Others find the figure of a <span class="accented">building</span> underlying the second word - Vulgate, <span class="accented">firmamentum</span> ("solid basis") - and this is its more usual meaning, and agrees with ver. 7 and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a>; also <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, LXX, for the <span class="accented">noun</span>, not found, elsewhere in the New Testament).

"Christ Jesus the Lord," is literally, <span class="accented">the Christ Jesus, the Lord</span> - an expression found besides only in <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a> (Revised Text). The prefixed article points out <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> in his full style and title as the Person whom the Colossians had received, and received as <span class="accented">the Lord.</span> "The Lord" has a predicative force, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> (R.V.); <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>. "Jesus is Lord" was the testing watchword applied in the discerning of spirits; "Jesus Christ is Lord" is to be the final confession of a reconciled universe; and "Christ Jesus is Lord" is the rule of faith that guides all conduct and tests all doctrine within the Church (comp. ver. 19; <a href="../../par/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). It is "a summary of the whole Christian confession" (Meyer). To vindicate this lordship, on which the Colossian error trenched so seriously, is the main object of the Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-20</a>). We must not, therefore, with Alford, Lightfoot, Hofmann, analyze "the Christ Jesus:" "Ye received the Christ, (namely) Jesus, who is the Lord." The writer has already used "Christ Jesus" as a single proper name at the outset (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1, 4</a>); and it was the <span class="accented">lordship of Christ Jesus, not the Messiahship of Jesus</span>, that was now in question. In <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5, 28</a> the situation is entirely different. In the following clause, "in him" is emphatic, as in ver. 7 (compare the predominant <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-22</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). Hence the contradiction of figure, "walk, rooted, and builded up," does not obtrude itself. (On "walk," see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; and on "in Christ" in this connection, see notes, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>.)

"Rooted" is perfect participle, in, plying an abiding fact ("fast rooted"); while "builded up" (literally, <span class="accented">upon</span> or <span class="accented">unto</span>) is in the present tense of a continued process, the prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> also implying growth and gain (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>). Meyer and Ellicott view <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> as a mere complement of the latter participle: "being builded in him."

THE CHRISTIAN'S COMPLETENESS IN CHRIST. The apostle has first defined his own doctrinal position in the theological deliverance of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, and has then skilfully brought himself into suitable personal relations with his readers by the statements and appeals of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23-2:7</a>. And now, after a general indication in ver. 4 of the direction in which he is about to strike, he unmasks the battery he has been all the while preparing, and delivers his <span class="accented">attack on the Colossian error</span>, occupying the rest of this second chapter, he denounces <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> its false philosophy of religion (vers. 8-15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its arbitrary and obsolete ceremonialism (vers. 16, 17); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its visionary angel worship (vers. 18, 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> its ascetic rules (vers. 20-22; ver. 23) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>reviewing the whole system in a brief characterization of its most prominent and dangerous features. It will be convenient to treat separately the first of these topics, under the heading already given, which indicates the positive truth developed by St. Paul in antagonism to the error against which he contends - a truth which is the practical application of the theological teaching of the first chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware lest there shall be some one who maketh you his spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit</span> (vers. 4, 18, 23; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). "Beware;" literally, <span class="accented">see</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> it), a common form of warning (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>). The future indicative" shall be," used instead of the more regular subjunctive "should be," implies that what is feared is too likely to prove the case (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> and (with another tense) <a href="../../par/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>). "Some one who maketh (you) his spoil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)" is an expression so distinct and individualizing that it appears to single out a definite, well known person. The denunciations of this Epistle are throughout in the <span class="accented">singular</span> number (vers. 4, 16, 18), in marked contrast with the <span class="accented">plural</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, and that prevails in the apostle's earlier polemical references. It is in harmony with the philosophical, Gnosticizing character of the Colossian heresy that it should rest on the authority of some single teacher, rather than on Scripture or tradition, as did the conservative legalistic Judaism. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, a very rare word, <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span> in the New Testament, bears its meaning on its face. It indicates the selfish, partisan spirit, and the overbearing conduct of the false teacher. Against such men St. Paul had forewarned the Ephesian elders (<a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>). "And empty deceit" stands in a qualifying apposition to "philosophy:" "His philosophy, indeed! "It is no better than a vain deceit." This kind of irony we shall find the writer using with still greater effect in ver. 18. <span class="accented">Deceit is empty</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>; distinguish from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">fruitless, vain</span>), which deceives by being a show of what it is not, <span class="accented">a hollow pretence.</span> From the prominence given to this aspect of the new teaching, we infer that it claimed to be a <span class="accented">philosophy</span>, and made this its special distinction and ground of superiority. And this consideration points (comp. Introduction, &sect; 4), to some connection between the system of the Colossian errorists and the Alexandrine Judaism, of which Philo, an elder contemporary of St. Paul, is our chief exponent. The aim of this school, which had now existed for two centuries at least, and had diffused its ideas far and wide, was to transform and sublimate Judaism by interpreting it under philosophical principles. Its teachers endeavoured, in fact, to put the "new wine" of Plato into the old bottles" of Moses, persuading themselves that it was originally there (comp. note on "mystery," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). In Philo, <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is the name for true religion, whose essence consists in the pursuit and contemplation of pure spiritual truth. Moses and the patriarchs are, with him, all "philosophers;" the writers of the Old Testament" philosophize;" it is" the philosophical man" who holds converse with God. This is the only place where <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is expressly mentioned in the New Testament; in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a> and context it is, however, only verbally wanting. According to the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ (vers. 17, 20, 22; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>). This clause qualifies "making spoil" (Meyer, Ellicott) rather than "deceit;" human authority and natural reason furnish the principles and the method <span class="accented">according to</span> which the false teacher proceeds. "Tradition" does not necessarily imply antiquity (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>); "of men" is the emphatic part of the phrase. These words are characteristic of St. Paul, who was so profoundly conscious of the supernatural origin of his own doctrine (see <a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31-35</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>). Similarly, "the rudiments of the world" are the crude beginnings of truth, the childishly faulty and imperfect religious conceptions and usages to which the world had attained apart from the revelation of Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>). It is not either Jewish or non-Jewish <span class="accented">elements</span> specifically that are intended. Jew and Greek are one in so far as their religious ideas are "not according to Christ." Greek thought had also contributed its <span class="accented">rudiments</span> to the world's education for Christ: hence, comprehensively, "the rudiments of <span class="accented">the world</span> "(comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). The blending of Greek and Jewish elements in the Colossian theosophy would of itself suggest this generalization, already shadowed forth in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Neander, Hofmann, and Klopper (the latest German commentator), have returned to the view that prevailed amongst the Fathers, from Origen downwards, reading this phrase, both here and in Galatians, in a physical sense, as in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>; the <span class="accented">elementa mundi</span>, "the powers of nature," "heavenly bodies," etc., worshipped by the Gentiles as gods, and which the Jews identified with the angels (ver. 18; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>) as God's agents in the direction of the world. This interproration has much to recommend it, but it scarcely harmonizes with the parallel "tradition of men," still less with the context of ver. 20, and is absolutely at variance, as it seems to us, with the argument involved in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Not the doctrine of Christ, but <span class="accented">Christ himself</span> is the substitute for these discarded <span class="accented">rudiments</span> (vers. 17, 20). His Person is the norm and test of truth (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-3</a>). The views combatted were "not according to Christ," for they made him something less and lower than that which he is.

In <a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18-20</a> we viewed a series of events; here we have an abiding fact. The whole plenitude of our Lord's Divine-human person and powers, as the complete Christ, was definitively constituted when, in the exercise of his kingly prerogative, "he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." "From henceforth" that fulness evermore <span class="accented">resides in him</span> (comp. note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>). The undivided <span class="accented">pleroma</span> of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a> now reveals its twofold nature: it is "the fulness of the Godhead," and yet "dwells corporeally in him." "Godhead" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) is the abstract of "God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), not of the adjective "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate therefore, wrongly, <span class="accented">divinitatis:</span> comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>; Wisd. 18:9), and denotes,"not Divine excellences, but the Divine nature" (Bengel); see Trench's 'Synonyms.' Schenkel and others, guided by a conjecture of Theodoret, have found here the <span class="accented">Church</span>, supporting their view by a very doubtful interpretation of <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. Still more groundless is the identification of this <span class="accented">pleroma</span> with <span class="accented">the created world.</span> The apostle unmistakably affirms that the Divine nature, in its entirety, belongs to the Church's Christ. The literal sense of "bodily" (maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Hofmann, after Chrysostom and Athanasius) has been avoided by those who render it "wholly" (Jerome); "essentially, substantially" (Cyril, Theophylact, Calvin, Klopper), as opposed to "relatively" or "partially;" "truly" (Augustine, Erasmus, Bengel, Bleek), as opposed to "figuretively" (ver. 17). The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (always <span class="accented">literal</span> in classical usage, along with its adjective) occurs only here in the New Testament; the adjective "bodily" in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>. "The body of his flesh" in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> affords a truer parallel than the language of ver. 17, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, bears an exceptional sense (see note). Elsewhere St. Paul balances in similar fashion expressions relating to the twofold nature of Christ (see parallels). The assertion that "all the fulness of Deity" dwells in Christ negatives the Alexandrine "philosophy," with its cloud of mediating angel powers and spiritual emanations; the assertion that it dwells in him <span class="accented">bodily</span> equally condemns that contempt for the body and the material world which was the chief practical tenet of the same school (comp. notes on Colossians 1:22 and Colossians 2:23).

"In him" is the primary predicate (see Alford, Ellicott, against Meyer: comp. ver. 3): "Ye are in him" is the assumption (<a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>); "(ye are) made complete" is the inference.

(On "principality," etc., see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>.) The Colossians were being taught to replace or supplement Christ's offices by those of angel powers (see notes, vers. 15, 18). Philo ('Concerning Dreams,' 1. &sect;&sect; 22, 23) writes thus of the angels: "Free from all bodily encumbrance, endowed with larger and diviner intellect, they are lieutenants of the All ruler, eyes and ears of the great King. Philosophers in general call them <span class="accented">demons</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); the sacred Scripture <span class="accented">angels</span>, for they report (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) the injunctions of the Father to his children, and the wants of the children to their Father....

In such a strain the Colossian "philosopher" may have been talking. But if Christ is the Maker and Lord of these invisible powers - (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>), and we are <span class="accented">in him</span>, then we must no longer look to them as our saviours.

In this respect the Christian is already <span class="accented">complete</span>, for his circumcision took place <span class="cmt_word">in the stripping off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5, 8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18-25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1, 2</a>).

"The stripping off of the body" was the ideal of the philosophical ascetics (see note on "body," ver. 23, and quotations from Philo). The apostle adds "of the flesh;" <span class="accented">i.e. of the body in so far as it was the body of the flesh</span> (vers. Colossians 2:13, 18, 23; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). "The flesh" (in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> that which Christ had <span class="accented">put on</span>; here that which the Christian <span class="accented">puts off:</span> comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>) is "the flesh of sin," of <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>, etc. "The body," while identified with this "flesh," is "the body of sin" and "of death" (<a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>; see Meyer, Godet, or Beet); sin inhabits it, clothes itself with it, and presents itself to us in its form; and this being the normal condition of unregenerate human nature, the sinful principle is naturally called <span class="accented">the flesh.</span> So "the (bodily) members" become "the members that are upon the earth," employed in the pursuit of lust and greed, till they become practically one with these vices (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>, see note; also <a href="../../par/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 23</a>). Yet "the body" and "the (sinful) flesh," while in the natural man one in practice, are in principle distinguishable (ver. 23: comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>], and separable (<a href="../../par/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a>). The deliverance from the physical acts and habits of the old sinful life, experienced by him who is "in Christ" (ver. 10; <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>), is "the circumcision according to the Christ," or here more pointedly "of Christ"  - a real and complete, instead of a partial and symbolic, putting away of the organic life and domination of sin which made the body its seat and its instrument. The genitive" of Christ <span class="accented">"is</span> neither objective ("undergone by Christ"), nor subjective ("wrought by Christ"), but stands in a mere general relation  -  "belonging to Christ," "the Christian circumcision."

"Having been buried" is replaced in the antithesis by the more assertive "ye were raised" (comp. vers. 13, 14; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 26</a>). "With" points to the "him" (Christ) of the previous clause (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). <span class="accented">Faith</span> is the instrumental cause of that which baptism sets forth (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>), and has for its object (not its cause: so Bengel) "the working" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; also <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>) "of God."

Baptism symbolizes all that circumcision did, and more. It expresses more fully than the older sacrament our parting with the life of sin; and also that of which circumcision knew nothing - the union of the man with the dying and risen Christ, which makes him "dead unto sin, and alive unto God." How needless, then, even if it were legitimate, for a Christian to return to this superseded rite! To heighten his readers' sense of the reality and completeness of the change which as baptized (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">believing</span>) Christians they bad undergone, he describes it now more directly as matter of personal experience.

Again the participle gives place to the finite verb: a colon is a sufficient stop at the end of ver. 12. <span class="accented">Death</span>, in St. Paul's theology, is "a collective expression for the entire judicial consequences of sin" (see Cromer's ' Lexicon,' on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3c2;</span>), of which the primary spiritual element is the sundering of the soul's fellowship with God, from which flew all other evils contained, in it. <span class="accented">Life</span>, therefore, begins with <span class="accented">justification</span>, (<a href="../../par/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18</a>).

The false teachers probably stigmatized the uncircumcised state as unholy. The apostle adopts the expression, but refers it to the pre-Christian life of his readers (see vers. 11, 12), when their Gentile uncircumcision was a true type of their moral condition (<a href="../../par/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>).

The nails of the cross in piercing Christ pierced the legal instrument which held us debtors, and nullified it; see <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); <a href="../../par/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4-6</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> may suggest the further idea of <span class="accented">nailing up</span> the cancelled document, by way of publication. At the cross all may read, "There is now no condemnation" (compare the "making a show" of ver. 15; also <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>).

It is precisely the same participle that we find in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>, and the writer has just used the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 11) in a corresponding sense (see note <span class="accented">in loc.</span> on the force of the double compound). He employs compounds of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> in the middle voice seventeen times elsewhere, and always in the sense of "putting off [or, 'on'] from one's self;" and there is no sure instance in Greek of the middle verb bearing any other meaning. Yet such critics as Meyer, Eadie, Klopper, cling to the rendering of the Vulgate and our Authorized Version; and not without reason, as we shall see. The Revised margin follows the earlier Latin Fathers and some ancient versions, supplying "his body" as object of the participle, understanding "Christ" as subject. But the context does not, as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>, suggest this ellipsis, and it is arbitrary to make the participle itself mean "having disembodied <span class="accented">himself."</span> Nor has the writer introduced any new subject since ver. 12, where" God" appears as agent of each of the acts of salvation set forth in vers. 12-15. Moreover, "the principalities and the dominions" of this verse must surely be those of ver. 10 and of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> (compare the "angels" of ver. 18). We understand St. Patti, therefore, to say "that God [revealing himself in Christ; 'in him,' 15 b] put off and put away those angelic powers through whom he had previously shown himself to men." The Old Testament associates the angels with the creation of the world and the action of the powers of nature (<a href="../../par/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; Psalm cir. 4), and with its great theophanies generally (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, etc.); and its hints in this direction were emphasized and extended by the Greek translators of the LXX. <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38, 53</a> (St. Stephen); <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, ascribe to them a special agency in <span class="accented">the giving of the Law.</span> <a href="../../par/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>. and it. show how large a place the doctrine of the mediation of angels filled in Jewish thought at this time, and how it tended to limit the mediatorship of Christ. The mystic developments of Judaism among the Essenes and the Ebionites (Christian Essenes), and in the Cabbala, are full of this belief. And it is a cornerstone of the philosophic mysticism of Alexandria. In Philo the angels are the "Divine <span class="accented">powers," "words," "images</span> of <span class="accented">God,"</span> forming the court and <span class="accented">entourage</span> of the invisible King, by whose means he created and maintains the material world, and holds converse with the souls of men (see quotation, ver. 10). This doctrine, we may suppose, was a chief article of the Colossian heresy. Theodoret's note on ver. 18 is apposite here: "They who defended the Law taught men to worship angels, saying that the Law was given by them. This mischief continued long in Phrygia and Pisidia." The apostle returns to the point from which he started in ver. 10. He has just declared that God has cancelled and removed the Law as an instrument of condemnation; and now adds that he has at the same time thrown off and laid aside the veil of angelic mediation under which, in the administration of that Law, he had withdrawn himself. Both these acts take place "in Christ." Both are necessary to that "access to the Father" which, in the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> view, is the special prerogative of Christian faith (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>), and which the Colossian error doubly barred, by its ascetic ceremonialism and by its angelic mediation. (See, on this passage, Alford; also Peirce's 'Paraphrase and Notes,' 2nd edit., 1729; Robertson Smith, on 'Christ and the Angels,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, second series, vol. 1:138, etc.; A. Sabatier's 'L'Apotre Paul,' p. 220, 2nd edit., 1881.) We are compelled, with all deference to its high authority, to reject the view of the Greek Fathers, to which Ellicott, Lightfoot, and Wordsworth have returned, according to which "Christ in his atoning death [in it; 'the cross,' ver. 15 b] stripped off from himself the Satanic powers." For it requires us to bring in, without grammatical warrant, <span class="accented">"somewhere"</span> (Lightfoot), "Christ" as subject; it puts upon" the principalities and the dominions" a sense foreign to the context, and that cannot be justified by <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the connection is wholly different and the hostile sense of the terms is most explicitly defined; and it presents an idea harsh and unfitting in itself, the incongruity of which such illustrations as those of the <span class="accented">Nessus robe</span> and <span class="accented">Joseph's garment</span> only make more apparent. It is one thing to say that the powers of evil <span class="accented">surrounded</span> Christ and quite another thing to say that he <span class="accented">wore</span> them as we have worn "the body of the flesh" (ver. 11; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>). He made a show (of them) openly, having led them in triumph in him; or, <span class="accented">it</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>:52; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). In this, as in the last verse, we have a finite verb between two participles, one introductory ("having stripped off"), the other explanatory, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to <span class="accented">make a show</span> or <span class="accented">example</span>, occurs in the New Testament besides only in <a href="../../par/matthew/1-17.htm">Matthew 1:17</a>, where it is compounded with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> (Revised Text), giving it a sinister meaning of not belonging to the simple verb. With the angelic <span class="accented">"principalities,"</span> etc., for object, the verb denotes, not a shameful exposure, but "an exhibition of them in their true character and position," such as forbids them to be regarded superstitiously (ver. 18). God exhibited the angels as the subordinates and servants of his Son (ver. 10: camp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>, etc.). "Openly" ( <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">in freedom of speech</span>, a favourite word of St. Paul s) implies the absence of reserve or restraint, rather than mere publicity (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("having triumphed;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a> only other instance of the verb in the New Testament; its use in classical Greek confined to Latinist writers, referring, historically, to the Roman <span class="accented">triumph</span>) presents a formidable difficulty in the way of the interpretation of the verse followed so far. For the common acceptation of the word "triumph" compels us to think of the "principalities," etc., as <span class="accented">hostile</span> (<span class="accented">Satanic</span>); and this, again, as Meyer strongly contends, dictates the rendering "having spoiled" for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. So we are brought into collision with two fixed points of our former exegesis. If we are bound lexically to abide by the reference to the Roman military triumph, then the angelic principalities must be supposed to have stood in a quasi-hostile position to "the kingdom of God and of Christ," <span class="accented">in so far as men had exaggerated their powers and exalted them at Christ's expense</span>, and to have been now robbed of this false pre-eminence. The writer however, ventures to question whether, on philological grounds, a better, native Greek sense cannot be found for this verb. The noun <span class="accented">thriambos</span> ("triumph"), on which it is based, is used, indeed, in the Latin sense as early as Polybius, a writer on Roman history (). But it is extant in a much earlier classical fragment as synonymous with <span class="accented">dithyrambos</span>, denoting "a festal song;" and again in Plutarch, contemporary with St. Paul, it is a name of the Greek god Dionysus, in whose honour such songs were sung, and whose worship was of a choral, processional character. This kinder <span class="accented">triumph</span> was, one may imagine, familiar to the eyes of St. Paul and of his readers, while the spectacle of the Roman triumph was distant and foreign (at least when he wrote 2 Corinthians). We suggest that the apostle's image is taken, beth here and in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, from <span class="accented">the festal procession</span> of the Greek divinity, who leads his worshippers along as witnesses of his power and celebrants of his glory. Such a figure fittingly describes the relation and the attitude of the angels to the Divine presence in Christ. Let this suggestion, however, be regarded as precarious or fanciful, the general exposition of the verse is not thereby invalidated. (For further elucidation, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 403-421; 11. p. 78. On "triumph," in 2 Corinthians, see Mr. Waite's <span class="accented">Additional note</span> in 'Speaker's Commentary.') The Revisers omit the marginal "in himself" of the Authorized Version, which correctly, as we think, refers the final <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> to <span class="accented">Christ</span> (ver. 10), though incorrectly implying "Christ" as subject of the verse. It was not only "in the cross" that God unveiled himself, dispensing with angelic theophanies, but in the entire person and work of his Son (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). "Which veil" (for here we may apply the words of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>) "is done away in Christ." So the whole passage (vers. 10-15) ends, as it begins, "in him:" "We are complete in him" - in our conversion from sin to holiness set forth in baptism, and our resurrection from death to life experienced in forgiveness (vers. 11-13); and in the removal at once of the legal bar which forbade our access to God (ver. 14), and of the veil of inferior and partial mediation which obscured his manifestation to us (ver. 15).

The new teachers dictated to the Colossians in these matters from the philosophical, ascetic point of view (see notes on "philosophy," "circumcision," vers. 8, 11), condemning their previous liberty. (For the adverse sense of "judge," comp. <a href="../../par/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4, 10, 13</a>.) The scruples of the "weak brethren" at Rome (<a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>) were partly of an ascetic character, but are not ascribed to any philosophic views. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a> and 10 the question stands on a different footing, being connected with that of the recognition of idolatry (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>). In <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a> it is purely a point of Jewish law. In one form or other it was sure to be raised wherever Jewish and Gentile Christians were in social intercourse. Ver. 17 shows that such restrictions are "not according to Christ" (ver. 8), belonging to the system which he has superseded. "Therefore" bases this warning upon the reasoning of the previous context. Tertullian ('Against Marcion,' 5:19) supplies the link connecting this verse with vers. 10, 15, 18, when he says, "The apostle blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats." The abolishing of angel mediation (ver. 15) robs these restrictions of their supposed authority. The Essenes found in the Nazarite life and the rules for the ministering Jewish priest (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-8.htm">Leviticus 10:8-11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>) their ideal of holiness. Philo also attached a high moral value to abstinence from flesh and wine, and regarded the Levitical distinctions of meats as profoundly symbolic. Or in respect of feast, or new moon, or sabbath (<a href="../../par/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9, 10</a>). The yearly <span class="accented">feast</span>, the monthly <span class="accented">new moon</span>, and the weekly <span class="accented">sabbath</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13, 14</a>) cover the whole round of Jewish sacred seasons. These the Colossian Gentile Christians, disciples of St. Paul through Epaphras, had not hitherto observed (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9, 10</a>). Philosophic Judaists insisted on these institutions, giving them a symbolical and ethical interpretation (see Philo, 'On the Number Seven;' also, 'On the Migration of Abraham,' &sect; 16, where he warns his readers lest, "because the feast is a symbol of the joy of the soul and of thanksgiving towards God," they should imagine they could dispense with it, or "break through any established customs which divine men have instituted").

With St. Paul, they shadow forth prophetically <span class="accented">the concrete facts of the Christian revelation</span>, and therefore are displaced by its advent. The singular verb (literally, <span class="accented">is</span>) quite grammatically combines the particulars of ver. 16 under their common idea of a foreshadowing of the things of Christ; and the present tense affirms here a general truth, not a mere historical fact.

Nothing is said here to discountenance positive Christian institutions, or the observance of the Lord's day in particular, unless enforced in a Judaistic spirit. The apostle is protecting Gentile Christians from the re-imposition of Jewish institutions as such, as impairing their faith in Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-9</a>), and as, in the case of the Colossians, involving a deference to the authority of angels which limited his sovereignty and sufficiency (vers. 8-10, 18, 19).

The errorist condemns the Colossian Christian for his neglect of Jewish observances (ver. 16), and warns him that in his present state he will <span class="accented">miss the heavenly prize</span>, "the hope" he had supposed to be "in store for him in heaven" (ver. 5: comp. notes on Colossians 1:5 and Colossians 3:15; also <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delighting in lowliness of mind and worship of the angels</span> (ver. 23; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17, 18</a>). By these means the false teacher  impressed his disciples. His angel worship commended itself as the mark of a devout and humble mind, reverent towards the unseen powers above us, and made purely <span class="accented">Christian</span> worship seem insufficient. "Delighting in" is the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> given by Bengel, Hofmann, Lightfoot, Klopper, and is preferable to that of Meyer and Ellicott, who, with several Greek interpreters, supply the sense of the previous verb "desiring (to do so) in lowliness etc.; and to that followed in the Revisers' margin,which puts a sort of adverbial sense on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - "of his mere will, by humility," etc. This latter rendering underlies the paraphrastic" voluntary humility" of the A.V., and agrees with the common interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23 (see note). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is, no doubt, a marked Hebraism, and St. Paul's language is "singularly free from Hebraisms" (compare, however, the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">to know</span>, in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; the similar <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is well established, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). This very idiom is frequently used in the LXX, and occurs in the 'Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,' a Christian writing, of the second century. The apostle may surely be allowed occasionally to have used a Hebraistic phrase, especially when so convenient and expressive as this. Westcott and Hort, with scrupulous purism, mark the reading on this account as doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> ("lowliness of mind"), a word, perhaps, compounded by St. Paul himself (see Trench's 'Synonyms'), is almost confined to the Epistles of this group (comp. ver. 23; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; also <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). This quality is ascribed <span class="accented">ironically</span> to the false teacher (compare the "puffed up" of the next clause, and for similar irony see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is "outward worship" or "devotion:" comp. note on ver. 23; elsewhere in New Testament only in <a href="../../par/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> and <a href="../../par/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26, 27</a> (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Worship of the angels" is that <span class="accented">paid to the angels</span>; not "offered by them," as Luther and Hofmann interpret, supposing that the errorists pretended to imitate the worship of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Investigating</span> (or, <span class="accented">dwelling on</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the things which he hath seen'! vainly - being puffed up by 'the reason' of his flesh</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:l, 7; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>). For <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we adopt the sense which it bears in 2 Macc. 2:30; in Philo, 'On the Planting of Noah,' &sect; 19. and in patristic and later Greek generally, viz. "to search into," "examine," "discuss" (see Suicer's 'Thesaurus'). The rendering "proceeding" or "dwelling on," though near the radical sense of the word ("to step on" or "in"), wants lexical support. The same may be said of the rendering "intruding into," which suits the Received reading, "which he hath <span class="accented">not</span> seen." The "not" of the relative clause is wanting in nearly all our eldest and best witnesses, and is cancelled by the Revisers, with Tregelles, Tischendorf, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, etc. Its appearance in two different forms (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>) in the documents that present it, makes it still more certain that it is a copyist's insertion. The common reading gives, after all, an unsatisfactory sense; it is not likely the apostle would blame the errorist simply for entering into things beyond his sight (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Meyer, after Steiger and Huther, gives the best explanation of "which he hath seen," supposing the writer to allude ironically to <span class="accented">pretended visions</span> of angels or of the spiritual world, by which the false teacher sought to impose on the Colossians. This view is suggested by Tertullian in the passage cited under ver. 16. Such visions would be suitable for the purpose of the errorist, and congenial to the Phrygian temperament, with its tendency to mysticism and ecstasy (see Theodoret, quoted under ver. 15, who also says that <span class="accented">angel worship</span> was specially forbidden by the Council of Laodicea, A.n. 364). If the false teacher were accustomed to say with an imposing air, "I have seen, ah! I have seen!" in referring to his revelations, the apostle's allusion would be obvious and telling. The language of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a> (R.V.) suggests a similar reliance on supernatural visions on the part of the apostle's earlier opponents. This pretentious visionary is, however, a "philosopher" and a "reasoner" first of all (vers. 4, 8). Accordingly he <span class="accented">investigates what he has seen</span>; inquires into the import of his visions, rationally develops their principles, and deduces their consequences. So far, the apostle continues in the ironical vein in which the first words of the verse are written, setting forth the pretensions of his opponent in his own terms, his irony "restraining itself till, after the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, the indignation of truth breaks forth from it" (Steiger) in the caustic and decisive "vainly." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span> qualifies the foregoing participle (so Origen, apparently, in Cramer's 'Catena,' vol. 4. p. 69; Steiger, De Wette, Hofmann, Conybeare) more suitably than the following. Thus it signifies "idly," "to no purpose," as everywhere else in St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>); not "without cause," as joined to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("puffed up"), whose 'force it could only weaken. "Vainly" stigmatizes the futility, "puffed up" the conceit, and "by the reason of his flesh" the low and sensuous origin of these vaunted revelations and of the high-flown theosophy which they were used to support. (For the sarcastic force of "puffed up," comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). The "reason" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) is, in Greek philosophy, the philosophical faculty, the power of supersensible intuition; and in Plato and Philo, the organ of the higher, mystical knowledge of Divine things (see Philo, 'Who is Heir of Divine Things?' &sect;&sect; 13, 20, and <span class="accented">passim</span>). The Colossian "philosopher" (ver. 8) would, we may imagine, speak of himself as "borne aloft" in his visions "by heavenly reason," "lifted high in angelical communion," or the like. Hence the apostle's sarcasm, "Exalted are they? say rather, <span class="accented">inflated: lifted high by Divine reason?</span> nay, but <span class="accented">swollen high by the reason of their flesh."</span> Some such allusion to the language of the errorists best accounts for the paradoxical <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Lightfoot); contrast with <a href="../../par/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>, and compare the disparaging reference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">Colossians</span> 1:21 (note). Difficult as this passage is, we hesitate to follow Lightfoot, and Westcott and Herr, who have given their weighty sanction to the perilous remedy of <span class="accented">conjectural emendations</span>; the latter editors for the second Line in this verse, and again in ver. 23. The line of interpretation here adopted is advocated in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 11. pp. 385-398.

In the last verse the errorist was judged "out of his own mouth," and the intrinsic hollowness of his pretensions was exposed. Now" he appears before the judgment seat of Christ," charged with high treason against him, the Lord alike of the kingdoms of nature and of grace. So the apostle falls back once more (comp. ver. 10) on the foundation laid down in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, on which his whole polemic rests. Both in creation and redemption, the philosophic Judaists assigned to the angels a <span class="accented">role</span> inconsistent with the sovereign mediatorship of Christ (see notes on vers. 10 and 15). <span class="cmt_word">From whom all the body, through its joinings and bands being supplied and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). Disloyalty to "the head" works destruction to "the body," which in this case "proceeds from" ("grows out of," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>,) its Head, while it depends upon him. Gnosticism from the beginning tended to disintegrate the Church, by the caste feeling (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>, note; Colossians 3:11) and the sectarian spirit to which it gave birth (ver. 8; <a href="../../par/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). Its vague and subjective doctrines were ready to assume a different form with each new exponent, Here lies the connection between this and the Ephesian letter, the doctrine of the Church following upon and growing out of that of the person of Christ, each being threatened - the latter immediately, the former more remotely  - by the rise of the new Judaeo-Christian mystic rationalism. Colossians asserts the "thou in me" of <a href="../../par/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a>; Ephesians the corresponding "I in them;" and both the consequent "they made perfect in one" (comp., especially, <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a> and Ephesians 4:7-16 with <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a> and Colossians 2:9-15). (On "body," see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> signifies, not "joints "as parts of the bony skeleton, but includes all points of contact and connection in the body; Latin <span class="accented">nexus, junetura</span> (see Lightfoot). Bengel and Meyer, following Chrysostom, interpret it as "senses," or "nerves;" but this does not commend itself either lexically or contextually. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a>) are the "ligaments," the stronger and more distinct connections that give the bodily framework unity and solidity. So, by the organic cooperation of the whole structure, the body of Christ is <span class="accented">furnished with its supplies</span>, enabled to receive and dispense to each member the needed sustenance; and "knit together" (ver. 2), drawn into a close and firm unity. "Supplied" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>) indicates a sustenance both required and due. In <a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a> we read of <span class="accented">the increase of the gospel</span>, in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a> of <span class="accented">the individual believer</span>, and now of <span class="accented">the Church as a body</span>) <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>). "The increase of God" is that which God bestows (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>), as it proceeds "from Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: ver. 10; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>), in whom is "the fulness of the Godhead" (ver. 9: comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a> and Ephesians 3:17  - 19). In <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> the same idea is expressed in almost the same terms. There, however, the growth appears as proper to the body, resulting from its very constitution; here, as a bestowment of God, dependent, therefore, upon Christ, and ceasing if the Church ceases to <span class="accented">hold fast</span> to him.

"Therefore" is struck out by the Revisers on the best authority. It would imply a logical dependence of this verse upon the last, which does not exist. This warning, like those of vers. 16, 18, looks back to the previous section, and especially to vers. 8, 10, 12. It is a new application of St. Paul's fundamental principle of the union of the Christian with Christ in his death and resurrection (see notes, vers. 11, 12). Accepting the death of Christ as supplying the means of his redemption (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14, 22</a>), and the law of his future life (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>), the Christian breaks with and becomes <span class="accented">dead</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> and) <span class="accented">from</span> all other, former religious principles; which appear to him now but childish, tentative gropings after and preparations for what is given him in Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-2.htm">Galatians 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>). On "rudiments," see note, ver. 8. There these "rudiments of the world" appear as general ("philosophical") principles of religion, intrinsically false and empty; here they are moral rules of life, mean and worthless substitutes for "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus." (For the Pauline idiom, "died from (so as to be separate, or free from)," comp. <a href="../../par/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Why, as</span> (men) <span class="cmt_word">living in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">world, are you made subject to decrees</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). To adopt the rules of the new teachers is to return to the worldly, pre-Christian type of religion which the Christian had once for all abandoned (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>). "World" bears the emphasis rather than "living" ("having one's principle of life:" comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>). Standing without the article, it signifies "the world as such," in its natural character and attainments, without Christ (ver. 8; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (the verb only here in the New Testament) is passive rather than middle in voice (Winer, p. 326; see Meyer <span class="accented">in loc.</span>); literally, <span class="accented">why are yon being dogmatized, overridden with decrees?</span> Compare "spell" (ver. 8), "judge" (ver. 16), for the domineering spirit of the false teacher.

The next verse seems to imply that all three verbs relate to matters of diet. Ambrose and other Latin Fathers of ascetic tendencies put these prohibitions into the mouth of St. Patti himself, reversing his meaning.

This is the position which Christ himself takes in regard to Jewish distinctions of meats (<a href="../../par/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-23</a>, R.V.). We note the same style of sarcastic comment on the language of the false teachers as that exhibited in ver. 18. Augustine, Calvin, and some ethers render, "which (decrees) tend to (spiritual) destruction in their use;" but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> never means simply "use," and the antecedent "decrees" is awkwardly supplied. More plausibly, De Wette and some moderns interpret, "things which tend to (spiritual) destruction in their abuse," putting the words in the mouth of the false teacher, as though he said, "Abstain from everything the use of which may be fatal to the soul." But this ascribes to the errorist an argument which fails short of his principles (see note on "hard treatment of the body," ver. 23); and to which, specious as it is, and in harmony with the apostle's own teaching (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-12.htm">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26, 27</a>), he makes no reply. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandments and teachings of men</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, LXX; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-7.htm">Mark 7:7</a>; ver. 8; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-5.htm">1 Corinthians 2:5, 13</a>); the only passage in this Epistle which distinctly alludes to the language of the Old Testament. But the words are, we may suppose, primarily a reminiscence of the language of Christ, who uses them in connection with his announcement of the abolition of the sacred distinctions of meats (comp. <a href="../../par/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>). This clause points out the method after which, and direction in which, the new teachers were leading their disciples, on the line of a man-made instead of a God given religion. "Commandments" (or, "injunctions") include the prescriptions of ver. 21 and all others like them; "teachings" embrace the general principles and doctrines on which these rules were based. So this expression, following "rudiments of the world (ver. 20), leads us back by a rapid generalization from the particulars specified in ver. 21 to the general starting point given in ver. 8 (see note), and prepares us for the brief and energetic summary of the whole Colossian error which we find in - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Such as have</span> (literally, <span class="accented">are</span> (<span class="accented">things</span>) <span class="accented">having</span>) <span class="cmt_word">word indeed of wisdom</span> (vers. 4, 8; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>). The antecedent of "such as" is "command merits and teachings" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott), not "decrees" (ver. 21). For ver. 22 supplies the immediate antecedent, and the wider sense thus given is necessary to support the comprehensive and summary import of ver. 23. The Greek "are having" brings into view the nature and qualities of the subject, in accordance with <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">such as</span>, the <span class="accented">qualitative</span> relative (comp. <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; see Moulton's Winer, pp. 209, 210; also Meyer and Ellicott, on the grammatical point). A certain "word of wisdom" was ascribed to the false teachers in ver. 4 (note the play upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in St. Paul's Greek). They were plausible dealers in words, and had the jargon of philosophy at their tongue's end (ver. 8, compare note on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 18). On this the apostle had first remarked in his criticism of their teaching, and to this he first, adverts in his final <span class="accented">resume.</span> "Word of wisdom" is one of the "gifts of the Spirit" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>; but the disparaging <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">indeed</span>, with the emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> throwing <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> into the shade, in view also of the censures already passed in vers. 4, 8, puts a condemnatory sense upon the phrase: "having <span class="accented">word</span> indeed of wisdom" - "that and nothing more, no inner truth, no pith and substance of wisdom" (so Chrysostom and OEcumenius). "Word and deed," "word and truth," form a standing antithesis (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>, etc.), the second member of which supplies itself to the mind; and the <span class="accented">solitary</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> in such a connection is a well-established classical idiom (see Winer's or A. Buttmann's 'Grammar;' also Meyer). It is superfluous, therefore, as well as confusing to the order of thought, to seek in the sequel for the missing half of the antithesis. Other renderings of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> - "show" (English A.V., Bengel, De Wette), "ground" or "reason" (Vulgate, Klopper), <span class="accented">"reputation"</span> (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot) - are partly doubtful or exceptional in point of usage, and partly overlook the pointed reference of vers. 22, 23 to the language of vers. 4 and 8. And the combination of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> into a single phrase is scarcely justified here in face of the established Pauline association of "word" and "wisdom" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-2:16</a>, as well as 1 Corinthians 12:8). Both in this Epistle and in 1 Corinthians the writer is contending against forms of error which found their account in the Greek love of eloquence and of dexterous word-play. While the first part of the predicate, therefore, explains the <span class="accented">intellectual attractiveness</span> of the Colossian error, the clause next following accounts for its <span class="accented">religious fascination</span>; and the third part of the verse strikes at the root of its <span class="accented">ethical and practical applications.</span> (Shown) <span class="cmt_word">in</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>devotion to</span> (or, <span class="accented">delight in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>worship</span> (or, <span class="accented">voluntary worship</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and lowliness of mind</span> (ver. 18). The preposition "in" brings us into the moral and religious sphere of life in which this would be wisdom of doctrine had its range and found its application. The prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span>  =  - of<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ordinarily connotes" willingness" rather than "wilfulness;" and the "delighting in worship" of ver. 18 (see note) points strongly in this direction. As against Ellicott and Lightfoot on the etymological point, see Hofmann, pp. 102, 103. Only so far as the <span class="accented">worship</span> in question (see note, ver. 18, on "worship") is evil, can the <span class="accented">having a will to worship</span> be evil. The other characteristics of the error marked in this verse seem to be recommendations, and "devotion to worship" is in keeping with them. This disposition, moreover, has an air of "humility," which does not belong to a <span class="accented">self-imposed, arbitrary worship.</span> There is a love of worship for mere worship's sake which is a perversion of the religious instinct, and tends to multiply both the forms and objects of devotion. This spurious religiousness took the form, in the Colossian errorists, of <span class="accented">worship paid to the angels.</span> On this particular worship the apostle passed his judgment in ver. 18, and now points out the tendency from which it springs. In ver. 18 "humility" precedes; here it follows "worship," by way of transition from the religious to the moral aspect of the now teaching. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unsparing treatment of</span> (the) body - <span class="cmt_word">not in any honour</span> (as) <span class="cmt_word">against surfeiting of the flesh</span> (vers. 16, 21, 22; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-23.htm">1 Corinthians 12:23-25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>). The "and" linking this clause to the last under the government of "in," is textually doubtful; Lightfoot cancels it; Westcott and Hort give the omission as a secondary reading. Mr. Hort regards the passage, like ver. 18, as hopelessly corrupt - a verdict which we would fain believe is too despairing. If <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> be struck out, then <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> must be attached, somewhat loosely, to the principal predicate (" are having") as an instrumental dative. On either construction, the sense appears to be that it was its combination of ascetic rigour with religious devotion that gave to the system in question its undoubted charm, and furnished an adequate field for the eloquence and philosophical skill of its advocate. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">unsparingness</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">surfeiting - both</span> found only here in the New Testament - and along with them "body" and "flesh," stand opposed to each other. This clause, therefore, contains a complete sense, and we must not look outside it for an explanation of the included words, "not in any honour." As we have seen, the first clause of the predicate (" having word indeed," etc.) needs no such complement. The clause "not .... flesh" is a comment on the words, "unsparing treatment of the body." On this topic the apostle had not yet expressed his mind sufficiently. He has in vers. 16, 20-22 denounced certain ascetic rules as obsolete, or as trifling and needless; but he has yet to expose the principle and tendency from which they sprang. He is the more bound to be explicit on this subject inasmuch as there were ascetic leanings in his own teaching, and passages in his earlier Epistles such as <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, which the "philosophical" party might net unnaturally wrest to their own purposes. He could not condemn severity to the body absolutely, and in every sense. The Colossian rigorism he does condemn - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as not <span class="accented">in keeping with bodily self-respect</span>, which is the safeguard of Christian purity; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as not in reality <span class="accented">directed against sensual indulgence</span>, the prevention of which is the proper end of rules of abstinence. These two objections are thrown into a single terse, energetic negative clause, obscure, like so much in this chapter, from its brevity and want of connecting particles. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> the phrase, "in honour," occurs in a similar connection: "That each one of you know how to 'gain possession of his own vessel" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to become master of his body:" see Wordsworth and Alford on the passage; also Meyer's reference on <a href="../../par/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>) "in sanctification and <span class="accented">honor"</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a> for the apostle's teaching respecting the dignity of the human body; also <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>). The contempt of Alexandrine theosophists for physical nature was fatal to morality, undermining the basis on which rests the government of the body as the "vessel" and vesture of the spiritual life. Their principles took effect, first, in a morbid and unnatural asceticism; then, by a sure reaction, and with equal consistency, in unrestrained and shocking licence. See, for the latter result, the Epistles to the seven Churches of Asia (<a href="../../par/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. and 3.); in the Pastoral Epistles, the two opposite effects are both signalized. The rendering "value" given by Lightfoot and the Revisers seems to us misleading; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> means "value" only in the sense of "price," as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>, and this surely is not their meaning. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> has been taken in a milder sense by the Greek commentators, Luther, and others: "satisfaction" "(<span class="accented">legitimate</span>) gratification." So the apostle is made to charge the false teachers with "not honouring the body, so as to grant the flesh its due gratification." But this rendering confounds the "body" and the "flesh," here contrasted, and gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> a meaning without lexical warrant (see Meyer and Lightfoot). And the sentiment it expresses errs on the anti-ascetic side, and comes into collision with <a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, in the LXX and in Philo, as in earlier Greek, denotes "physical repletion," and is associated with drunkenness and sensual excess generally. Hence we cannot admit the interpretation of Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, who make the "flesh" here the <span class="accented">sinful principle</span> generally, and understand "surfeiting" figuratively, supposing the apostle to mean, that the ascetic rules in question, while they dishonour the body, tend to gratify the carnal mind." This gives an idea true in itself, and agreeing with the sense of "flesh" in vers. 11, 18, but out of place here, while it strains the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> (see Lightfoot's exhaustive argument). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not help us, meaning "for" or "against," according to its connection. We combine Lightfoot's interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> with Wordsworth's and <span class="accented">Alford's</span> of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>. The saying of <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a> ("whose god is their belly, and their glory in their shame") contains the same opposition of "honour" to "fleshly indulgence" as that supposed here, possibly suggested by the phrase, "surfeiting of dishonor" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), of the LXX in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>. Here, then, the apostle lays hold of the root principle of the false teachers' whole scheme of morality, its <span class="accented">hostility to the body as a material organism.</span> Such a treatment, he declares, dishonours the body, while it fails, and for this very reason, to prevent <span class="accented">that feeding of the flesh</span>, the fostering of sensual appetency and habit, in which lies our real peril and dishonour in regard to this vessel of our earthly life. Here we have a suitable starting-point for the exhortations of the next chapter, where the apostle, in vers. 1-4, shows the true path of deliverance from sensual sin, and in vers. 5-7 sets forth the Christian asceticism - "unsparing treatment" <span class="accented">of the flesh</span> indeed! The line of teaching adopted by the errorists may be illustrated by Philo's doctrine in his third book of the 'Allegories of the Sacred Law,' &sect; 22: "'God saw that Er was wicked;' for he knows that this <span class="accented">leathern burden</span> of ours, the body - for <span class="accented">Er</span>, being interpreted, is <span class="accented">leathern</span>  - is evil and always plotting against the soul; and it is ever under the power of death, indeed actually dead [comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>]. Yet this all do not see, but only God, and those he loves. For when the mind [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> comp. note, ver. 18] becomes engaged in sublime contemplations and is initiated into the mysteries of the Lord [note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>], it judges the body to be evil and hostile;" again ('On the Change of Names,' &sect; 4): "Pale and wasted,  and reduced to skeletons as it were, are the men devoted to instruction, having transferred to the powers of the soul their bodily vigour also, so that they have become, as we might say, dissolved into a single form of being, that of pure soul made bodiless by force of thought [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see <a href="../../par/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, note]. In them the earthly is destroyed and overwhelmed, when reason [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>: ver. 18], pervading them wholly, has see its choice on being well pleasing to God."

THE TRUE CHRISTIAN LIFE. The apostle, having delivered his attack on the system of error inculcated at Colossae, now passes from the controversial to the more practical purport of his letter. There is no break, however, in the current of his thought; for throughout this chapter he urges the pursuit of a practical Christian life in a sense and in a manner silently opposed to the tendencies of Gnosticizing error. How much more congenial was the task to which he now addresses himself we may judge, perhaps, from the ease and simplicity which mark the language of this chapter, as compared with the abrupt and seemingly embarrassed style of the last section. We may analyze the hortatory section of the Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4:6</a>) as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>, urging the Colossians to maintain <span class="accented">a lofty spiritual life</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> vers. 5-8, <span class="accented">to put off</span> their old vices, <span class="accented">impurity, malice, falsehood</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> vers. 9-14, <span class="accented">to put on</span> the new Christian virtues, especially <span class="accented">gentleness, forgivingness, love</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> vers. 15-17, to let <span class="accented">the sovereign influence of Christ</span> sway their whole life - inward, social, secular; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> ver. 18 - <a href="../../par/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>, enjoining the Christian discharge of their relative duties, as <span class="accented">wives and husbands, children and fathers, servants and masters</span>, under the sense of their allegiance to <span class="accented">the Lord Christ</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> <a href="../../par/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2-4</a>, exhorting to <span class="accented">constant prayer</span>, and especially for the apostle himself at the present juncture; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(g)</span> vers. 5, 6, to wise conduct and edifying speech <span class="accented">toward them that are without.</span> It will be seen how much more comprehensive and systematic is the view thus presented of Christian duty than that furnished by earlier Epistles; and how the ideas of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">supremacy of Christ, the unity of the Christian brotherhood</span>, and <span class="accented">the sacredness of the natural constitution of human life</span>, which were threatened by the rise of Gnosticism in Colossae, underlie the apostle's exposition of Christian ethics. Paragraphs (a) to (d) in the above analysis we have grouped together under the title given to this section; (e) demands a separate treatment; and (f) and (g) will finally be bracketed together. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If, therefore, ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at God's right hand; mind the things above, not the things upon the earth</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-13.htm">Luke 12:13-40</a>). The apostle has already shown that when his readers, entering the gate of baptism, became Christians through faith in Christ, they <span class="accented">died with him</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>), <span class="accented">were buried</span>, then <span class="accented">raised and made alive together with him</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>): comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>.

At the same time, they left behind all childish, tentative forms and notions ("rudiments") of religion, whether Jewish or non-Jewish (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 11, 18, 20-23</a>). They became dead both from sin and from human modes of salvation. Both are included in "the things upon the earth," to which belong at once the grosser sensual forms of sin (ver. 5) with its "surfeiting of the flesh" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>), and that vaunted <span class="accented">philosophy</span>, which is after all earth born and earthward tending (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 20</a>), bringing the soul again into bondage to material things. The apostle lifts his readers into a new, heavenly sphere. He bids them make "the things above," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the things of Christ," the one object of their thought and endeavour. So they will master the flesh <span class="accented">by rising above it</span>, instead of fighting it on its own ground by ceremonial rite and ascetic regimen. "The things above" are no abstract, transcendental conception, as in the theology of St. Paul's opponents, for they are "where Christ is." The things "in the heavens" as well as those "upon the earth" were created "in him, through him, unto him" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>); <span class="accented">there</span> he is Lord, even as <span class="accented">here</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).

The former denotes a morbid, inflamed condition of the sensual appetite; the latter, craving for some particular gratification of it (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). Neither of these words is etymologically, or invariably, evil in sense. The degradation of such terms in all languages is a sad evidence of the corruption of our nature. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is both wider and more intense in meaning than our "covetousness."

Hence it applies to sins of impurity, greediness for sensual pleasure (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>); but by the emphatic use of the article ("the covetousness"), and by the words that follow, it is marked out as a distinct type of sin; so in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>, where "uncleanness" and "greed" are stigmatized as <span class="accented">vile</span> forms of sin. This word, often used by St. Paul, is peculiar to him in the New Testament. "The which" (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: setup. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>) gives a reason while it states a fact ("inasmuch as it is idolatry"). For the thought, setup. <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, also <a href="../../par/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; it is a commonplace of religion, and appears in Philo and Jewish rabbis (see Lightfoot). Lightfoot places a colon after "upon the earth," and supposes "fornication," etc., to be "proleptic accusatives," looking forward to some verb unexpressed, such as "put off" (ver. 8). But this is needless (see Winer, p. 666), and the command, "make dead your members," requires this qualifying explanation. The grammatical awkwardness of the apposition is not without rhetorical effect.

"The anger of God is coming" is a sentence complete in itself (setup. <a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). God's "anger" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>) is his settled punitive indignation against sin, of which his "wrath" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is the terrible outflaming (<a href="../../par/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>); see Trench's 'Synonyms.'

The enmity between Greek and Jew being removed, the malice and falsehood that grew out of it will disappear (vers. 8, 9: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>). In <a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> "Jew" stands first, and the distinction of <span class="accented">sex</span> is added. The distinctions here enumerated appear as looked at from the Greek side. Only here in the New Testament does "Greek" precede "Jew" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>, etc.). "Barbarian" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>) and "Scythian" (only here in the New Testament) are together opposed to "Greek," and imply want of culture rather than alien nationality, the Scythian being the rudest of barbarians (see Lightfoot's full note). Such terms of contempt would, in Asia Minor, be commonly applied by Greeks to the native population. The party who affected philosophic culture (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 23</a>) may, perhaps, have applied them to simple, uneducated Christians (see note on Colossians 1:28). (On "circumcision," see <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; and for the connection with ver. 9, comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>.)

"Christ" stands at the end of the sentence, with accumulated emphasis. The Church regards and values each man in his relation to Christ, and bids every other consideration bow to this. He is "all things" - our common centre, our standard of reference, and fount of honour, the stun of all we acknowledge and desire; and he is "in all" - the common life and soul of his people, the substance of all we experience and possess as Christians. The second "all" is masculine (so most commentators, from Chrysostom downwards), referring more specially to the classes just enumerated. Similarly, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>.

Just as in the spiritual sphere, and in the relations between God and man, Christ is shown to be <span class="accented">all</span>, so that "principalities and powers" are comparatively insignificant (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10, 15</a>); so in the moral sphere, and in the relations between man and man.

To address the Colossian Christians as <span class="accented">elect</span> is to remind them of all that they owe to God's grace. "Elect" as chosen by God, they are "holy" as devoted to God. By the latter title they were first addressed (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>); holiness is the essence of Christian character. That they should gain this character and appear in it at the last judgment was the purpose of Christ's atoning death (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 22</a>), as it was the purpose of God's eternal election of believers (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). "And" is marked as doubtful by Lightfoot, Westcott and Heft; "it is impossible not to feel how much the sentence gains in form by its omission" (Lightfoot). "Beloved" (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is the perfect participle passive; it describes the position of those who, carrying out by their present holiness the purpose of their past election, are the objects of God's abiding love (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). This love dictated their election and set at work the means by which it should be secured (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9, 10</a>).

Christ is "the beloved One" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.), and those who are "in him" in their measure share the same title (<a href="../../par/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23-26</a>).

The objects of "pity" are the suffering and miserable; of "kindness," the needy and dependent. The "lowliness of mind" of <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18, 23</a> was something specious and to be guarded against; here it is the central and essential element of the true Christian temper (<a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>), its self-regarding element (<a href="../../par/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>).

"Pity" and "kindness," preceding "humility," relate to the claims of others upon us; "meekness" and "long suffering," to our bearing towards them. "Meekness," the opposite of rudeness and self assertion (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>), is a delicate consideration for the rights and feelings of others, especially necessary in administering rebuke or discipline (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>), and conspicuous in Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>). St. Peter marks it as a womanly virtue (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). "Long suffering" is called forth by the conduct of "the evil and unthankful" (see <a href="../../par/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>, and note). St. Paul claims this quality for himself (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>).

"Forgive" is literally "to grant grace," used of Divine forgiveness m <a href="../../par/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a> (see note).

This argument is latent in the appeal to the "elect" and "beloved" of ver. 12. The evidence for the alternative readings, "Lord" and "Christ," is nearly equal in weight. In any case, the "Lord" is "Christ" in this passage (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17, 24</a>): and that <span class="accented">he</span> forgave (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, note) is quite consistent with the assertion that <span class="accented">God</span> forgave (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>), for God forgave "in Christ" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). So "God in Christ reconciled" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>); and yet "Christ reconciled us" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>). "Forgiving," supplied in thought from previous context, completes the sense of "so also ye" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott). To suppose an ellipsis of the imperative, with Light foot and the English Version ("do ye"), is needlessly to break the structure of the sentence. Ver. 14 shows that the leading imperative, "put on," of ver. 12 is still in the writer's mind.

Love is <span class="accented">the bond</span> in the active sense, as that <span class="accented">wherewith</span> the constituents of a Christian character or the members of a Church are bound together: peace, in a passive sense, as that <span class="accented">wherein</span> the union consists (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>). "Love" (compare "covetousness," ver. 5) is made conspicuous by the Greek definite article - being <span class="accented">that eminent, essential</span> grace of Christian love (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>, etc.). "Perfectness" is genitive of object, not of quality: love unifies the elements of Christian goodness and gives them in itself their "perfectness" (<a href="../../par/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>). (For "perfectness," see note on "perfect," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; and comp. 4:12.) Against Galatian teachers of circumcision, and Corinthian exalters of knowledge, the apostle had magnified the supremacy of love (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>); and so against the Colossian mysticism and asceticism he sets it forth as the crown of spiritual perfection, the goal of human excellence (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>).

Here is the source of inner tranquillity and health of soul (see note on "peace," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); and of the outward union and harmony of the Church, the body of Christ (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15-19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>). In <a href="../../par/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Christ's peace</span>, his "legacy," is that which he possessed and exemplified - an idea foreign to this context. This "peace" is to "act as umpire" in the Christian's heart.

The Greek commentators seem, therefore, to be right, as against most moderns (but see Klopper on the other side), in retaining the primary sense of the verb instead of generalizing it into "rule" or the like. It stands in precise antithesis, both of sense and sound, to <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>: "Let not the deceivers decide against you, but let the peace of Christ decide in your hearts" (Cramer's 'Catena'). "The peace of Christ" dwelling within the heart is to be the security of the Colossian believer against the threats of false teachers: "They seek to rob you of your prize; let this assure you of it." Present, conscious peace with God is a warrant of the Christian's hope of everlasting life (<a href="../../par/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31-39</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>). This assurance is identical with "the witness of the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). The apostle argued in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 5</a> from the present faith and love of his readers to "the hope laid up for them in heaven;" here he bids them find in the peace which Christ has brought to their souls the earnest of their future bliss. It is but a generalizing of the same idea when he speaks in <a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a> of "the peace of God" as "garrisoning the heart and thoughts" against fear and doubt. <span class="cmt_word">Unto which also ye were called, in one body</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-18, 1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-17.htm">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>). So this "peace" is to be at once their inward safeguard, and the ground of their outward union. They are to stand together in its defence (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>). Error, which blights the Church's <span class="accented">hope</span>, destroys her unity. So the maintenance of that "one hope of our calling," assured by a Divine peace within the soul, unites all Christian hearts in a common cause (compare the connection of vers. 18 and 19 in <a href="../../par/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>.). With St. Paul, the peace of God's children with him and with each other is so essentially one that he speaks almost indistinguishably of both (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He adds, and be ye thankful</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>); viz. "for this assurance of your future blessedness afforded by the peace of Christ within your hearts, with its outward evidence in your Christian unity." The apostle gave thanks for them on like grounds (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5</a>: comp. 1:12-14). The command <span class="accented">to give thanks</span> prevails in this Epistle, as that <span class="accented">to rejoice</span> in Philippians. "Be" is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("become"); so in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1, 17</a>. It implies "striving after an aim as not yet realized" (Meyer: comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>) - rather, therefore, "to be in act," "to prove" or "show one's self thankful" (see Grimm's 'Lexicon;' and comp. <a href="../../par/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-36.htm">Luke 10:36</a>).

The "word of Christ" is the Christian doctrine, <span class="accented">the gospel</span> in the widest sense of the term (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>), as proceeding from Christ (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>). This precise phrase occurs <span class="accented">only</span> here, where the name of <span class="accented">Christ</span> is emphasized in so many ways (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>). The apostle, it may be, alludes primarily to the personal teaching of Christ himself (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>). "You" is understood collectively by Meyer and others ("amongst you"); but the verb "dwell in" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5, 14</a>) requires the stronger sense, suggested also by the "in your hearts" of ver. 15 (comp. note on "in you," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). As "the word" is rich in the Divine wealth stored in it (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-6.htm">Titus 3:6</a>), so it is to dwell "richly" in those who possess it. "In all wisdom" God's grace abounded (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-8.htm">Ephesians 1:8</a>), and St. Paul himself taught (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>); so with the <span class="accented">richly indwelling word</span> in the minds of the Colossians, especially as they were beset by intellectual forms of error (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-4, 8, 23</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15</a>). In this connection of thought, the phrase appears to belong to the previous sentence; so English Version and Lightfoot. Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and Ellicott, however, attach it to the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Teaching and admonishing each other</span> [or, <span class="accented">yourselves:</span> comp. ver. 13, note] (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>). (For this absolute participial nominative, so marked a feature of St. Paul's style, comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>; Winer, p. 716.) What he is doing in his own ministry and by writing this letter, he bids the Colossians do for each other. "Teaching" precedes, being suggested by "wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">With psalms, hymns, spiritual songs</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>). These are to be a chief means of mutual edification. The repeated "and," also the singular "heart," and "Lord" in place of "God" in the sequel of the verse, are borrowed by the Received Text from <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>. The Greeks, the Asiatic Greeks in particular, were devoted to the arts of music. Song and jest, stimulated by the wine cup, were the entertainment of their social hours (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4, 18, 19</a>). Their Christian intercourse is still to be enlivened by the varied use of song, and by the play of wholesome wit (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>); but both song and speech are to be "in grace," stamped with a spiritual character and governed by a serious Christian purpose. A "psalm" (from <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to play</span> an instrument) is "a song set to music;" but this name was already in the LXX appropriated to its present use. Whether its application here is restricted to the psalms of the Old Testament is doubtful (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15, 26</a>). "Hymn" (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) denotes a solemn, religions composition, or song of Divine praise. The word "song" (<span class="accented">ode</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1fa0;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>) is wider in sense; hence is qualified by "spiritual," equivalent to "with [or, 'in'] the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>) - "songs of a spiritual nature, inspired by the Holy Ghost" (comp. "spiritual wisdom," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>). Such songs would echo the varied sentiments and experiences of the Christian life. In <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11-13</a>, very possibly, we have fragments of early Christian song. St. Paul's own language, in more exalted moods, tends to assume a rhythmic and lyrical strain (see introductory note on Colossians 1:15-20). <span class="cmt_word">In grace singing, in your hearts, to God</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2, 15, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-19.htm">1 John 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>).

The tendency to omit the article in prepositional phrases should be taken into account in its favour here. And the article helps the sense by giving "grace" a definite Christian meaning (so "the love," ver. 14). Otherwise, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> may mean no more than "gracefully," "pleasantly;" comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>. "The (Divine) grace" is the pervasive element and subject matter of Christian song. Its constant refrain will be, "to the praise of the glory of his grace!" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6, 12, 14</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5, 6</a>). "In your hearts" (ver. 15) - the inner region of the soul - there is the counterpart, audible "to God," of the song that vibrates on the lips. In <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a> we read, "with your hearts" - the instrument (here the region) of the song.

We note that in each of the three family relations here dealt with, the subordinate party is first addressed, and the duty of submission is primarily insisted upon (vers. 18, 20, 22: comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>). So in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3, 5-8</a>. There may have been some special reason for this in the state of the Asiatic Churches or of Greek society in that region. But other indications show (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-24.htm">1 Corinthians 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5, 9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>) that the apostle perceived and sought to check the danger of unsettlement in the natural order of family and social life which often attends great spiritual revolutions, especially when they are in the direction of religious liberty. As in the case of Luther, the apostle's later teaching is largely directed against the antinomianism which resulted, by way of perversion and abuse, from the preaching of salvation by grace and of the sanctity of the individual believer (comp. introductory note to this chapter). Observe how <span class="accented">the Lord</span> and his authority are made to furnish a higher sanction for each of these natural duties. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fit in the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11-15</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). On this duty the apostle dilates in the Ephesian letter, in illustration of its teaching respecting "Christ and the Church" (comp. the very different treatment of it in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-7</a>), The use of the <span class="accented">article</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) in the nominative of address is frequent in New Testament, though not in classical Greek. Lightfoot thinks it Hebraistic. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> stands in the imperfect tense (literally, <span class="accented">it was</span> fit), denoting a normal propriety (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4</a>, Westcott and Hort; and for the general expression, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-13.htm">1 Corinthians 11:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-8.htm">Philemon 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>). Like all men of a sound moral nature, St Paul has a strong sense of natural propriety. The adjunct "in the Lord" belongs to "was fit," not "be subject" (comp. ver. 20). The constitution of nature, as we have learnt in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>, is grounded "in the Lord." In <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a> St. Paul shows that this inherent propriety has a deep spiritual significance; and he makes the subjection of the Church to her heavenly Lord a new reason for wifely submission.

"Love" is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, the word which expresses the highest spiritual affection - "even as Christ loved the Church" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>). Here, first and most of all, the "new commandment" of <a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> applies. St. Paul only uses the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> ("to make bitter") here, but he has the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("bitterness") in a wider application in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>. It denotes "exasperation," prompting to hasty severity. Bengel defines it as "odium amori mixtum" - hatred infused into love.

But here, where "Christ is all and in all" (ver. 11), it is "in the Lord" (Revised Text) that the child's obedience is declared to be "well pleasing." There is something especially pleasing in the behaviour of a lovingly obedient child, that wins "favour" both "with God and man" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>). The law of filial obedience has its creative ground "in him" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>), and is an essential part of the Christian order of life, which is the natural order restored and perfected. "Well pleasing" is a favourite word of St. Paul's (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-10.htm">Ephesians 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-9.htm">Titus 2:9</a>, etc.; used also in Hebrews).

It implies a use of parental authority which, by continual exactions and complaints, teaches the child to look on the father as his enemy rather than his friend.

And they were undoubtedly numerous in the early Church. The gospel has always been welcome to the poor and oppressed. The attitude of St. Paul and of Christianity towards slavery claims consideration under the Epistle to Philemon; on this point see Lightfoot's 'Introduction.' Here and in <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a> (comp. vers. 7, 8) the apostle calls the master <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("lord") in reference to "the Lord Christ" (vers. 22 b, 24); elsewhere in the New Testament, as in common Greek, the opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>, etc.), "According to flesh," that is, "in outward, earthly relationship" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/4-1.htm">Romans 4:1</a>): Christ is <span class="accented">the Lord</span> in the absolute and abiding sense of the word (similarly, "in the flesh" and "in the Lord," <a href="../../par/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not with acts of eye service</span> (literally, <span class="accented">not</span> <span class="accented">in eye services</span>)<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> as man pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-34.htm">Luke 11:34</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/123-2.htm">Psalm 123:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>).

The servant whose aim it is to please his earthly master in what will catch his eye, plays a <span class="accented">double</span> part, acting in one way when observed, in another when left to himself; with this duplicity is contrasted "singleness of heart" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a> and 1 Cor 9:11, 13 has a different application). "Fearing the Lord" more than the eye of his earthly lord, the Christian servant will always act in "singleness of heart;" for "the eyes of the Lord are in every place." In the same manner the apostle ("bondman of Christ Jesus," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>) speaks of his own relations to men and to the Lord Christ respectively (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4-6</a>, etc.: comp. <a href="../../par/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37-44</a>). The reading "God" of Received Text is a copyist's emendation, a sample of a large class of corruptions of the text, where a word more familiar in any given connection is, more or less unconsciously, substituted for the original word.

"In Christ," Onesimus is "no longer as a slave, but a brother beloved" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>), and if a brother, then a joint heir with his master Philemon in the heavenly inheritance (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye serve the Lord Christ</span> (vers. 22, 25; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>); that is, <span class="accented">Christ is the Lord whose bondmen ye are.</span> "For" is probably a correct gloss, though a corrupt reading. Its insertion indicates that the sentence was read indicatively (Lightfoot, and R.V.); not imperatively ("serve the Lord Christ"), as Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, with the Vulgate, construe it. The verse amounts to this: "Work as for the Lord: he will repay you; you are his servants."

"For" is replaced by "but" in the same inferior copies which insert it in the last sentence. Here we have the ether side of the recompense promised in ver. 24 <span class="accented">a</span>, to which the explanatory "for" points back. The impartial justice which avenges every wrong guarantees the reward of the faithful servant of Christ. So the Old Testament saints rightly argued (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7-10</a>) that the punishment of the evil doer affords hope to the righteous man. This warning is quite general in its terms, and applies alike to the unfaithful servant and to the unjust master (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>). At the judgment seat of Christ there will be no favouritism: all ranks and orders of men will stand on precisely the same footing (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, twice employed here, denotes a legal wrong or injury (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7, 8</a>); <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the conduct of Onesimus towards Philemon (ver. 18).

The apostle turns from the slave to address his master. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ch. 4:1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye lords, show just dealing and fairness to your servants</span> [<span class="accented">bondmen</span>] (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23-35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>). The verb "show" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">afford, render</span>) is middle in voice, and, as in <a href="../../par/luke/7-4.htm">Luke 7:4</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>, implies spontaneity - "show on your part," "of yourselves." <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("the just"), a concrete expression, denotes the justice of the master's <span class="accented">dealing</span> (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>, "the kind dealing of God"). <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> gives the principle by which he is to be guided, that of <span class="accented">equity, fairness</span> (so Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot). "Equity is the mother of Justice" (Philo, 'On the Creation of Magistrates,' &sect; 14; see other illustrations in Lightfoot). Meyer contends for the stricter sense, "equality" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-13.htm">2 Corinthians 8:13, 14</a>) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Church status and brotherhood (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). But the context suggests no such special reference; it deals with the family and social relationship of master and servant "Equity" is a well-established sense of the Greek word. The law of equity bearing on all human relations Christ has laid down in <a href="../../par/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>. Here is the germinal principle of the abolition of slavery. Moral equity, as realized by the Christian consciousness, was sure in course of time to bring about legal equality. Knowing that ye also have a Lord in heaven (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). (On "knowing," see ver. 24 a.) "Ye also," for Christ is "both their Lord and yours" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>, Revised Text). The lordship of Christ dominates the whole Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 10, 19</a>, etc.). The assertion that the proud master who deemed his fellow man his chattel is himself a mere <span class="accented">slave</span> of Christ, sets Christ's authority in a vivid and striking light. This consideration makes the Christian master apprehensive as to his treatment of his dependents. <span class="accented">He</span> is "in heaven" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>;

"Grace," here without the article, is not, as in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>, where the article should probably be read, "the (Divine) grace," but a property of speech itself, "gracefulness" the kindly, winning pleasantness which makes the talk of a good and thoughtful man attractive: comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a> (44:3, LXX); <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:12</a> (LXX); Sir. 21:16. "Salt" is the "wholesome point and pertinency" (Ellicott) <span class="accented">seasoning</span> conversation, while grace <span class="accented">sweetens</span> it.

In <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a> the connection is different, and the application more general (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49, 50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That you may know how you ought to answer each one</span> (ver. 4; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>).

They were, like St. Paul, "set for the defence of the gospel," placed in the van of the conflict against heresy. They needed, therefore, "to have all their wits about them," so as to be able, as occasion required, to make answer to each of their opponents and questioners, that they might "contend" wisely as well as "earnestly for the faith." <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a> is a commentary on this verse: the parallelism is the closer because that Epistle was addressed to Churches in Asia Minor, where the debates out of which Gnosticism arose were beginning to be rife; and because, likewise, "the hope that was in them" was a chief object of the attack made on the Colossian believers (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 23, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>). With this exhortation the Christian teaching of the Epistle is concluded. In its third and practical part (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4:6</a>) the apostle has built up, on the foundation of the doctrine laid down in the first chapter, and in place of the attractive but false and pernicious system denounced in the second, a lofty and complete ideal of the Christian life. He has led us from the contemplation of its "life of life" in the innermost mystery of union with Christ and of its glorious destiny in him (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>), through the soul's interior death-struggle with its old corruptions (vers. 5-11) and its investment with the graces of its new life (vers. 12-15), to the expression and outward acting of that life in the mutual edification of the Church (vers. 16, 17), in the obedience and devotion of the family circle (ver. 18 - <a href="../../par/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>), in constant prayerfulness and sympathy with the ministers and suffering witnesses of Christ (vers. 2-4), and, lastly, in such converse with men of the world, and in the midst of the distracting debate by which faith is assailed, as shall fittingly commend the Christian cause.

PERSONAL MESSAGES AND GREETINGS. St. Paul concludes his letter, first, by introducing to the Colossians its bearer, Tychicus, along with whom he commends to them their own Onesimus, returning to his master (vers. 7-9); then, according to his custom, he conveys greetings from his various friends and helpers present with him at the time, in particular from Mark, who was likely to visit them, and from Epaphras their own devoted minister (vers. 10-14); thirdly, he sends greeting to the neighbouring and important Church of Laodicea, specially mentioning Nympha, with directions to exchange letters with the Laodiceans, and with a pointed warning to Archippus, probably a Colossian, having some charge over that Church (vers. 15-17). Finally, he appends, with his own hand, his apostolic greeting and benediction (ver. 18). The personal references of this section, though slight and cursory, are of peculiar value, bearing themselves the strongest marks of genuineness, and decisively attesting the Pauline authorship of the Epistle. At the same time, we gather from them several independent facts throwing light on St. Paul's position during his imprisonment, and on his relations to other leading personages of the Church. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that relates to me</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the things concerning me</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant</span> (<span class="accented">bondman</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>will make known to you</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; 1:8; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>). Tychicus appears first in <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, where he is called an "Asian" (of the Roman province of Asia, of which Ephesus was capital), along with Trophimus, who, in <a href="../../par/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>, is styled "the Ephesian." He accompanied the apostle on his voyage to Jerusalem (A.D. 58), with a number of others representing different Churches, and deputed, as Lightfoot thinks, in conformity with the directions of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3, 4</a>, to convey the contributions raised for "the poor saints at Jerusalem." Trophimus was with St. Paul in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>), and so, probably, his colleague (the words, "as far as Asia," in <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, are of very doubtful authority), he is now with the apostle in his imprisonment at Rome, about to be sent home with these two letters (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>), and in charge of Onesimus, on whose account the apostle sends a private letter to Philemon. In the interval between the first (present) and second imprisonment (2 Timothy), the apostle revisited the Asiatic Churches (so we infer from <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>), and Tychicus rejoined him; for we find St. Paul proposing to send him to Titus in Crete (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), and finally sending him from Rome once more to Ephesus (2 Timothy 6:12). These facts sustain the high terms in which he is here spoken cf. "In the Lord" belongs both to "minister" and "fellow servant." This language is almost identical with that used of Epaphras in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see notes). Tychicus is "minister" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), not to Paul himself (<a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), nor in the official sense of <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, but "of Christ," "of the gospel," or "the Church" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), as St. Paul himself (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23, 25</a>). He is "a beloved brother" to his fellow believers, "a faithful minister" of the Lord Christ, and "a fellow servant" with the apostle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>).

The Received Text reads, by a slight confusion of similar Greek letters, <span class="accented">that he may know the things about you</span> (see Lightfoot's 'Notes on some Various Readings'). This is the only clause exactly identical in Colossians and Ephesians. There would be great anxiety on St. Paul's account amongst the Gentile Christians everywhere, and especially in the Asiatic Churches, after the ominous words of his address to the Ephesian elders (<a href="../../par/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-25</a>: comp. vers. 37, 38). The Colossians had sent through Epaphras messages of love to him (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>). To know that he was of good courage, and even in hope of a speedy release (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>), would "comfort their hearts."

And Onesimus even shares with the honoured Tychicus in the privilege of being the apostle's messenger! <span class="cmt_word">All things that are happening here they will make known to you</span> (ver. 7; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>). There is, therefore, no need for any detailed account of the writer's circumstances. The solicitude which he assumes that these stranger Colossians (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>) feel on his behalf shows how commanding his ascendancy over the Gentile Churches had become.

Aristarchus, as a Thessalonian, accompanied the apostle to Jerusalem, along with Tychicus the Asian (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), and was his companion at least during the first part of his voyage to Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>).

The supposition that these men were permitted as friends to share St. Paul's captivity in turn, is conjectural (see Meyer). Possibly the incident recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> was attended by some temporary joint imprisonment of St. Paul and Aristarchus. As "a soldier of Christ Jesus," the apostle was himself now "a prisoner of war" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3-6</a>); and therefore those who shared his sufferings were his "fellow prisoners," as they were his" fellow soldiers" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a>) and his "fellow servants" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, about whom you received commandments - if he should come to you, welcome him</span> (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>). It is pleasant to find John Mark, who deserted the apostle in his first missionary journey (<a href="../../par/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>), and on whose account he separated from Barnabas (<a href="../../par/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-40</a>) ten years before, now taken again into his confidence and friendship (comp. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). And indeed it is evident that there was no permanent estrangement between the two great Gentile missionaries; for Mark is called "cousin of Barnabas" by way of recommendation (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 9, 13</a>). Mary, the mother of John Mark, was a person of some consideration in the Church at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>), and through her he may have been related to Barnabas, who, though a Cypriot Jew, had property near Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36, 37</a>), and was also highly honoured by the mother Church (<a href="../../par/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25, 26</a>). Mark is, moreover, a link between the Apostles Paul and Peter. It is to the house of his mother that the latter betakes himself on his escape from Herod's prison (<a href="../../par/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>). In <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a> he appears, along with Silvanus (Silos), St. Paul's old comrade, in St. Peter's company, who calls him "my son." St. Peter was then at Babylon, where Mark may have arrived at the end of the journey eastwards which St. Paul here contemplates his undertaking. The striking correspondence of language and thought between St. Peter's First Epistle (addressed, moreover, to Churches of Asia Minor) and those of St. Paul to the Ephesians and Colossians (and, in an equal degree, that to the Romans) suggests the existence of some special connection at this time between the two writers, such as may well have been afforded by Mark, if, leaving Rome soon after the despatch of these letters, he travelled in their track by way of Asia Minor to join St. Peter at Babylon. At the time of St. Paul's second imprisonment, about four years later, Mark is again in Asia Minor in the neighbourhood of Timothy, and the apostle desires his services at Rome (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). When or how the Colossians had received already directions concerning Mark, we have no means of knowing. His journey appears to have been postponed. The apostle must before this have communicated with the Colossians. The visit of Epaphras to Rome may have been due to some communication from him. "If he should come to you, give him a welcome," is the request the apostle now makes.

"Justus" ("just," "righteous") was frequently adopted by individual Jews, or conferred on them, as a Gentile (Latin) surname (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-7.htm">Acts 18:7</a>); it implied devotion to the Law, and was the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Zadok</span> (see Lightfoot).

Aristarchus, therefore, was a Jew, as well as Mark and Jesus Justus. "These only," etc., must be read as in close apposition to the previous clause. This statement accords with the apostle's complaint in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-24</a>; but the still stronger language of the latter passages seems to point to a later time when he was yet more solitary, having lost Tychicus and Mark, and perhaps Aristarchus also, and when he had a more definite prospect of release. The title "fellow worker" he frequently confers on his associates (see references). In <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> it is applied, to Luke and Demas also.

It indicates the deep anxiety of Epaphras for this beloved and endangered Church. There is nothing here to point to "outward toil" (Lightfoot), any more than in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>. The apostle loves to commend his fellow labourers (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20-22, 25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis</span> (vers. 15-17; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>).

Whether Epaphras were the official head of these Churches or not, he could not but be deeply concerned in their welfare. Ver. 17 indicates the existence of a personal link between the Churches of Colossus and of Laodicea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Luke the physician, the beloved, saluteth you</span> (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). This reference to Luke's profession is extremely interesting. We gather from the use of the first person plural in <a href="../../par/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10-17</a>, and again from Acts 20:5 to the end of the narrative, that he joined St. Paul on his first voyage to Europe and was left behind at Philippi; and rejoined him six years after on the journey to Jerusalem which completed his third missionary circuit, continuing with him during his voyage to Rome and his imprisonment. This faithful friend attended him in his second captivity, and solaced his last hours; "Only Luke is with me" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). His being called "the physician" suggests that he ministered to the apostle in this capacity, especially as "his first appearance in St. Paul's company synchronizes with an attack of St. Paul's constitutional malady" (Lightfoot: comp. <a href="../../par/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-15</a>; the illness referred to in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</a> and 2 Cor 4:7-5:8 may partly have led to Luke's rejoining St. Paul in Macedonia). St Luke's writings testify both to his medical knowledge and to his Pauline sympathies. His companionship probably gave a special colouring to the phraseology and cast of thought of St. Paul's later Epistles. (On the relations of St. Luke and St. Paul, see a valuable Paper by Dean Plumptre in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 4. pp. 134-156.) "The beloved" is a distinct appellation, due partly to Luke's services to the apostle, but chiefly, one would suppose, to the amiable and gentle disposition of the writer of the third Gospel. It is not unlikely that he is "the brother" referred to in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-18.htm">2 Corinthians 8:18, 19</a>. <span class="accented">Lucas</span> is a contraction for <span class="accented">Lucanus</span>; so that he was not the "Lucius" of <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, nor, certainly, the "Lucius my kinsman" of <a href="../../par/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>, who was a Jew. He was probably, like many physicians of that period, a freedman; and, since freedmen took the name of the house to which they had belonged, may have been, as Plumptre conjectures, connected with the family of the Roman philosopher Seneca and the poet Lucan. <span class="cmt_word">And Demas</span> (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>), who alone receives no word of commendation - a fact significant in view of the melancholy sentence pronounced upon him in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>. His name is probably short for <span class="accented">Demetrius.</span>

Perhaps the brethren in Hierapolis (ver. 13) were not formed into a distinct Church as yet (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). The Church in Laodicea early became a flourishing and wealthy community (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Nympha</span> (or, <span class="accented">Nymphas</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and the Church</span> (literally, <span class="accented">assembly</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>at her</span> (or, <span class="accented">their</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>house.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> may be either masculine or feminine accusative. The reading "her" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) is adopted by Westcott and Hort without alternative, and seems on the whole the most probable. The Revised Text follows Tischendorf, Tregelles, Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, who read "their" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). "His" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) is evidently a later correction. Lightfoot says, indeed, that "a Doric form of the Greek name (<span class="accented">sc.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) seems in the highest degree improbable;" but he allows, on the other hand, that <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> as a contracted masculine form (for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) "is very rare." This person was apparently a leading member of the Laodicean Church, at whose house Church meetings were held (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). "The Church at her house" can scarcely have been an assembly distinct "from the brethren that are in Laodicea." Both expressions may relate to the same body of persons, referred first individually, then collectively as a meeting gathered at this place. Others suppose a more private gathering to be meant, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Colossians living at Laodicea (Meyer). Many older interpreters identified this Church with <span class="accented">the household</span> of Nymphas. If "their" be the true reading, the expression must include <span class="accented">Nympha and her family.</span> Nympha (or Nymphas), like Philemon and his family, St. Paul had doubtless met in Ephesus.

The leaven of the Colossian error was doubtless beginning to work in Laodicea also. The words addressed to Laodicea in the Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>) bear reference apparently to the language of this Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 41, etc. The phrase, "Church of Laodiceans," corresponds to that used in the salutation of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, but is not found elsewhere in St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">And that ye also read the letter from Laodicea.</span> What was this letter? Clearly <span class="accented">a letter from St. Paul</span> which would be received at Laodicea, and which the Colossians were to obtain from there. The connection of this sentence with the foregoing, and the absence of any other definition of the words, "the letter (from Laodicea)," make this evident. Nothing further can be affirmed with certainty. But several considerations point to the probability that this missing Epistle is none other than our (so-called) Epistle to the Ephesians.

On the other hand, the main arguments of the Colossian letter are, as it seems, assumed and presupposed in the Ephesian (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10, 20</a> <span class="accented">b-</span>23, 2:20 <span class="accented">b</span>, 3:8 <span class="accented">b-</span>11, 19 <span class="accented">b</span>, 4:13 <span class="accented">b</span> with <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20, 2</a>:9, 10; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> with <a href="../../par/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8, 16-23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x1ff3;</span> in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a> are of doubtful authenticity; and there is much in the internal character of that Epistle to favour the hypothesis, proposed by Archbishop Usher, that it was <span class="accented">a circular letter</span>, destined for a number of Churches in Asia Minor, of which Ephesus may have been the first and Laodicea the last (compare the <span class="accented">order</span> of <a href="../../par/revelation/2-3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>.). In that case a copy of the Ephesian Epistle would be left at Laodicea by Tychicus on his way to Colossae. (See Introduction, &sect; 6; compare that to Ephesians.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Marcion, in the middle of the second century (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:11, 17), entitled the Epistle to the Ephesians, "To the Laodiceans." It does not appear that his heretical views could have been furthered by this change. Probably his statement contains a fragment of ancient tradition, identifying the Epistle in question with that referred to by St. Paul in this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The expression, "the letter <span class="accented">from Laodicea</span>," would scarcely be used of a letter addressed simply <span class="accented">to the Laodiceans</span> and belonging properly to them; but would be quite appropriate to a more general Epistle transmitted from one place to another. There is extant in Latin a spurious epistle 'Ad Laodicenses,' which is traced back to the fourth century, and was widely accepted in the Middle Ages; but it is "a mere cento of Pauline phrases, strung together without any definite connection or any clear object" (Lightfoot). (On this curious forgery, and on the whole subject of "the Epistle from Laodicea," see Lightfoot's masterly discussion, pp. 274  - 300; also p. 37.) Meyer, on the other hand, in his 'Introduction to Ephesians,' pronounces strongly against "the circular hypothesis." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou receivedst in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Lord, that thou fulfil it</span> (<a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6, 11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13, 14, 20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>). From the connection of this verse with the two preceding, it seems likely that "the ministry" of Archippus related to the Laodicean Church. Hence he is not addressed directly. If he was, as we gather from <a href="../../par/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 1, 2</a>, the son of Philemon, whose house formed a centre for the Colossian Church (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>), the warning would be suitably conveyed through this channel. In the letter to Philemon, the apostle calls him his" fellow soldier" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29, 30</a>). Both from this fact, and from the emphasis of the words before us, it would appear that his office was an important one, probably that of chief pastor. This warning addressed so early to the minister of the Laodicean Church is premonitory of the lapsed condition in which it is afterwards found (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 42, 43. (For "ministry" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>, etc. For "received," comp. note, <a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>.)

"Fulfil" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>). This admonition resembles those addressed to Timothy in the Pastoral Epistles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen. </div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The salutation with mine own hand - of Paul</span> (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-21.htm">1 Corinthians 16:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11-18</a>). So the apostle appends his authenticating signature to the letter, written, as usual, by his amanuensis, himself inscribing these last words (see parallel passages). The Epistle to Philemon he appears to have penned himself throughout (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Remember my bonds</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>). This pathetic postscript is thoroughly characteristic (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/6-17.htm">Galatians 6:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace be with you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the grace</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>). The apostle's final benediction in all his Epistles; here in its briefest form, as in 1 and 2 Timothy. In the Ephesian benediction "grace" is also used absolutely. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a> gives the formula in its full liturgical amplitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../colossians/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Colossians 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Colossians 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_thessalonians/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Thessalonians 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Thessalonians 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
