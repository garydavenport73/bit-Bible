It is noteworthy that he keeps entirely out of sight his natural relationship to our Lord, and styles himself simply "a bond-servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ." That, and that alone, gave him a right to speak and a claim to be heard. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is similarly used by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a> by St. Peter in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; and by St. Jude ver. 1. It is clearly an <span class="accented">official</span> designation, implying that his office is one "in which, not his own will, not the will of other men, but only of God and of Christ, is to be performed" (Huther). <span class="cmt_word">To the twelve tribes</span>, etc. Compare the salutation in <a href="../../par/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>, which was also probably written by St. James: "The apostles and the elder brethren unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is common to both, and not found elsewhere in apostolic greet-tugs. (It is used by Ignatius in the opening of all his epistles except that to the Philadelphians.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The letter in the Acts is addressed to <span class="accented">Gentile</span> communities in <span class="accented">definite</span> regions; St. James's Epistle, to <span class="accented">Jews of the dispersion.</span> So also his contemporary Gamaliel wrote "to the sons of the dispersion in Babylonia, and to our brethren in Media, and to all the dispersion of Israel" (Frankel, 'Monatsschrift,' 1853, p. 413). <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>; Clem., 'Rom,' l, &sect; 55; 'Prefer. Jacob.,' c.i.). Such expressions are important as tending to show that the Jews were regarded as representing, not simply the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, but the whole nation, including those so often spoken of as "the lost tribes" (cf. 1 Esdr. 7:8). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span>. The abstract put for the concrete. It is the word used by the LXX. for the "dispersion" (2 Macc. 1:27; Jud. 5:19; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, etc.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jews "so scattered among the nations as to become the seed of a future harvest" (Westcott on St. <a href="../../par/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a>). (On the importance of the dispersion as preparing the way for Christianity, see the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 44:1.) It was divided into three great sections: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">Babylonian</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the original dispersion; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Syrian</span>, dating from the Greek conquests in Asia, Seleucus Nicator having transplanted largo bodies of Jews from Babylonia to the capitals of his Western provinces; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="accented">Egyptian</span>, the Jewish settlements in Alexandria, established by Alexander and Ptolemy I., and thence spreading along the north coast of Africa. To these we should, perhaps, add a fourth - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="accented">Roman</span>, consequent upon the occupation of Jerusalem by Pompey,  <span class="date">B.C. 63</span>. All these four divisions were represented in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-8.htm">Acts 2:8-11</a>) - a fact which will help to account for St. James's letter. The whole expression, "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad," makes it perfectly clear that St. James is writing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Jews, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to those beyond the borders of Palestine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-18.</span> - THE SUBJECT OF TEMPTATION.

A favorite expression with St. James, occurring no less than fifteen times in the compass of this short Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Count it all joy</span>, etc.; cf. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a>, "Wherein ye greatly <span class="accented">rejoice</span>, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief <span class="accented">in manifold temptations</span>, that the <span class="accented">proof of your faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)...  might be found unto praise," etc. The coincidence is too close to be accidental, although the shade of meaning given to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is slightly different, if indeed it has any right in the text in St. Peter (see Herr, vol. it. p. 102). Here it has its proper force, and signifies <span class="accented">that by which the faith is tried</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the instrument of trial rather than the process of trial. Thus the passage in ver. 3 becomes parallel to <a href="../../par/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>, "tribulation worketh patience." With regard to the sentiments of ver. 2, "Count it all joy," etc., contrast <a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>. Experience, however, shows that the two are compatible. It is quite possible to shrink beforehand from temptation, and pray with intense earnestness, "Lead us not into temptation," and yet, when the temptation comes, to meet it joyfully, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The use of this word implies that the temptations of which St. James is thinking are <span class="accented">external</span> (see <a href="../../par/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30</a>, where the same word is used of the man <span class="accented">who fell among</span> thieves). <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32, 33</a> will show the trials to which believing Jews were subject. But the epithet "manifold" would indicate that we should not confine the word here to trials such as those.

The whole passage before us (vers. 2-6) affords a most remarkable instance of the figure called by grammarians anadiplosis, the repetition of a marked word at the close of one clause and beginning of another. "The trial of your faith worketh <span class="accented">patience</span>; but let <span class="accented">patience</span> have her <span class="accented">perfect</span> work, that ye may be <span class="accented">perfect</span> and entire, <span class="accented">lacking</span> in nothing.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all <i>men</i> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> <span class="accented">- Digression suggested by the thought of perfection.</span> There can be no true perfection without wisdom, which is the gift of God, and must be sought from him. It is possible that the thought and connection of the passage is due to a reminiscence of Wisd. 9:6, "For though a man be never so perfect (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded." But whether this be so or not, the teaching is manifestly founded on our Lord's words with regard to prayer, <a href="../../par/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, "Ask, and it shall be given you;" and <a href="../../par/mark/11-23.htm">Mark 11:23</a>, "Have faith in God.

The image is taken from the wave sheaf, the firstfruits of the harvest, the earnest of the crop to follow. St. Paul (according to a very possible reading) has the same figure in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, "God chose you as firstfruits (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>);" see R.V. margin. Elsewhere he applies it to Christ, "the Firstfruits of them that are asleep" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). "His creatures (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." It does not appear to be absolutely necessary to extend the use of this word so as to include the irrational creation as well as mankind. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> is frequently used in rabbinical writings for <span class="accented">the Gentile world</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> may be given the same meaning here, and perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>.

Similar maxims were not infrequent among the Jews.

In the rabbinical work, 'Pirqe Aboth,' 1. 12, we have the following saying of Rabbi Simeon, the son of Gamaliel (who must, therefore, have been a contemporary of St. James): "All my days I have grown up amongst the wise, and have not found ought good for a man but silence; not learning but doing is the groundwork; and whoso multiplies words occasions sin."

The figurative meaning occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>. Properly it signifies to "peep into." See its use in the LXX., <a href="../../par/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6</a>; Ecclus. 21:23. When used figuratively, it conveys the idea of looking into, but scarcely with that <span class="accented">intensive</span> force which is often given to it and for which <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> would be required (see Dr. Field's 'Otium Norvicense,' p. 147). Its use in St. Peter, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, is easy enough to explain. Angels desire even a glimpse of the mysteries. But what are we to say of its use hero?

The substantive is anarthrous, yet the attributive has the article. This construction serves to give greater prominence to the attributive, and requires the rendering given above (see Winer, &sect; 20:4).

Bishop Lightfoot has pointed out ('Galatians,' p. 108) that, in the Old Testament, the expression is a neutral one, not necessarily involving any idea of partiality, and more often used in a good than in a bad sense. "When it becomes an independent Greek phrase, however, the bad sense attaches to <span class="accented">it</span>, owing to the secondary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as a mask,' so that  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> signifies 'to regard the external circumstances of a man' - his rank, wealth, etc. - as opposed to his real intrinsic character. Thus in the New Testament it has always a bad sense." It is exactly this <span class="accented">regard to external circumstances</span> against which St. James is warning his readers; and the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ had himself been known, when on earth, as no respecter of persons (<a href="../../par/luke/20-21.htm">Luke 20:21</a>), would give point to his warning. The plural (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is perhaps used to include the different kinds of manifestations of the sin.

Hence this rendering is to be preferred. So Huther, Plumptre, and Farrar, the latter of whom explains the passage as follows: "It shows <span class="accented">doubt to</span> act as though Christ had never promised his kingdom to the poor, rich in faith; and <span class="accented">wicked reasonings</span> to argue mentally that the poor <span class="accented">must</span> be less worthy of honor than the rich."

St. James's use here is somewhat similar (see on James 1:9, etc.). "Christiani multi ex pauperibus erant: pauci ex divitibus" (Bengel). The "rich men" here alluded to are evidently such as was the Apostle Paul before his conversion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They dragged the poor Christians before the judgment-seat (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). So Saul, "haling (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) men and women, committed them to prison" (<a href="../../par/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They blasphemed the honorable Name by which Christians were called.

No difficulty need be felt about the presence of these rich men in the synagogues of the Christians (see Introduction, p. 8.). It will be noticed that St. James <span class="accented">never</span> calls them "<span class="accented">brethren."</span> Further, it must be remembered that, at this early date, the Church had not yet learnt by bitter experience the need for that secrecy with which in later days she shrouded her worship. At this time the Christian assemblies were open to any who chose to find their way in. All were welcome, as we see from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-23.htm">1 Corinthians 14:23</a>, etc., where the chance entry of "<span class="accented">men</span> unlearned or unbelieving" is contemplated as likely to happen. Hence there is no sort of difficulty in the presence of the "rich man" here, who might be eagerly welcomed, and repay his welcome by dragging them to the judgment-seat. <span class="cmt_word">Draw you before the judgment-seats.</span> The account given by Josephus of the death of St, James himself affords a good illustration of the manner in which Christians were liable to this (see Introduction, p. 6.). But the tribunals need not be confined to Jewish ones. Other instances of similar treatment, illustrating the thoughts and language of the passage before us, may be found in <a href="../../par/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>.

[The tendency of the Jews to rely on their claim as "Abraham's children" is rebuked by the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>) and by our Lord (<a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>).

With St. Paul' it is the negation of law: "Ye are not under Law, but under grace" (<a href="../../par/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>). With St. James it is the perfection of Law. But, as Bishop Lightfoot has pointed out, "<span class="accented">the</span> ideas underlying these contradictory forms of expression need not be essentially different." The mere ritual has no value for St. James. Apart from anything higher it is sternly denounced by him (<a href="../../par/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>, etc.). The gospel is in his view a <span class="accented">Law</span>, but it is no mere system of rules, "Touch not, taste not, handle not;" it is no hard bondage, for it is a law of <span class="accented">liberty</span>, which is in exact accordance with the teaching of St. Paul, that "<span class="accented">where</span> the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <span class="accented">liberty"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>). But: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The question now arises. Granting that St. James does not contradict the doctrine of St. Paul, is he not opposing Antinomian perversions of it, and writing with conscious reference to the teaching of the apostle of the Gentiles, and the misuse which some had made of it? To this question different answers have been returned. "So long as our range of view is confined to the apostolic writings, it seems scarcely possible to resist the impression that St. James is attacking the teaching, if not of St. Paul himself, at least of those who exaggerated and perverted it. But when we realize the fact that the passage in Genesis was a common thesis in the schools of the day, that the meaning of faith was variously explained by the disputants, that diverse lessons were drawn from it - then the case is altered. The Gentile apostle and the Pharisaic rabbi might both maintain the supremacy of faith as the means of salvation; but faith with St. Paul was a very different thing kern faith with Maimonides, for instance. With the one its prominent idea is a <span class="accented">spiritual life</span>, with the other an <span class="accented">orthodox creed</span>; with the one the guiding principle is the individual conscience, with the other an external rule of ordinances; with the one faith is allied to liberty, with the other to bondage. Thus it becomes a question whether St. James's protest against reliance on faith alone has any reference direct or indirect to St. Paul's language and teaching. Whether, in fact, it is not aimed against an entirely different type of religious feeling, against the Pharisaic spirit which rested satisfied with a barren orthodoxy fruitless in works of charity" (Lightfoot on 'Galatians,' p. 164; the whole essay should be carefully studied). In favor of this view of the entire independence of the two writers, to which he inclines, Bishop Lightfoot urges: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> That the object of the much-vaunted faith of those against whom St. James writes is "<span class="accented">the</span> fundamental maxim of the Law," "Thou believest that God is one" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>); not "the fundamental fact of the gospel," "Thou believest that God raised Christ from the dead" (<a href="../../par/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> That the whole tone of the Epistle recalls our Lord's denunciations of the scribes and Pharisees, and seems directed against a kindred spirit. To these we may add: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> That the teaching of St. Paul and St. James is combined by St. Clement of Rome ('Ep. ad Corinthians,' c. 12.) in a manner which is conclusive as to the fact that he was unaware of any divergence of view between them, whether real or apparent. We conclude, then, that the teaching of St. James has no direct relation to that of St. Paul, and may well have been anterior in time to his Epistles to the Romans and Galatians.

The reading, and by consequence the translation, must be considered somewhat doubtful, as scarcely any two uncials read the words in precisely the same order. The illustration is taken from the central command of the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), indicating that the case of Jews is under consideration. The following quotations from the Talmud will show the importance attached by the Jews to this command (Farrar, 'Early Days,' etc., p. 83). It is said ('Berachoth,' fol. 13, 6) that whoever in repeating it "<span class="accented">prolongs</span> the utterance of the word '<span class="accented">One</span>,' shall have his days and years prolonged to him." Again we are told that when Rabbi Akibah was martyred he died uttering this word "One;" and then came a Bath Kol, which said, "<span class="accented">Blessed</span> art thou, Rabbi Akibah, for thy soul and the word 'One' left thy body together."

(cf. 15:13); the "matter" of a book in 2 Macc. 2:24; the "matter" of a fire in Ecclus. 28:10 (the whole passage, vers. 8-12, is wroth comparing with the one before us); and for "forest" in <a href="../../par/job/38-40.htm">Job 38:40</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>. It is most natural to take it in this sense here (so Syriac and Vulgate, <span class="accented">silva</span>). "The literal meaning is certainly to be preferred to the philosophical" (Lightfoot on Revision, p. 140). Forest fires are frequently referred to by the ancients. Virgil's description of one ('Georgies,' 2:303) is well known; so also Homer's ('Iliad,' 11:155).

(76.) 19 may be appealed to. But more natural is the interpretation of Dean Plumptre, who takes it as "a figure for the whole of life from birth, the wheel which then begins to roll on its course and continues rolling until death." So Huther and Dean Scott in the ' Speaker's Commentary.' This view has the support of the Syriac Version: "The course of our generations which run as a wheel;" and is implied in the (false) reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (compare the Vulgate). It should also be noticed that life is compared to a wheel in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And is set on fire.</span> The tongue has already been called a fire. It is now shown how that fire is kindled - kern beneath, kern Gehenna. A similar expression is found in the Targum on <a href="../../par/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a>, "Lingua dolosa ... cum carbonibus juniperi, qui incensi sunt in Gehenna interne." Gehenna, here personified, is mentioned also in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-9.htm">Matthew 18:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43, 45, 47</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-5.htm">Luke 12:5</a>.

This valley, from its associations, became a type of hell; and hence its name was taken by the Jews to denote the place of torment.

"An unusual sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, hardly distinguishable from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in fact taken up by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (Alford). With the expression, "that war in your members," comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, "<span class="accented">Abstain</span> from fleshly lusts which war against the soul." Ver. <span class="cmt_sub_title">2 gives us an insight into the terrible difficulties with which the apostles</span> had to contend. Those to whom St. James was writing were guilty of lust, which actually led to murder. So the charge in <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-15.htm">1 Peter 4:15</a> evidently presupposes the possibility of a professing Christian suffering as a murderer or thief. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill</span>. The marginal rendering "<span class="accented">envy"</span> supplies a remarkable instance of a false reading once widely adopted, although resting simply on conjecture. There is no variation in the manuscripts or ancient versions. All alike have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But, owing to the startling character of the expression in an address to Christians, Erasmus suggested that perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye envy," was the original reading, and actually inserted it in the second edition of his Greek Testament (1519). In his third edition (1522) he wisely returned to the true reading, although, strangely enough, he retained the false one, "<span class="accented">invidetis</span>," in his Latin version, whence it passed into that of Beza and others. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> appears, however, in a few later editions, e.g. three editions published at Basle, 1524 (Bebelius), 1546 (Herwagius), and 1553 (Beyling), in that of Henry Stephens, 1576; and even so late as 1705 is found in an edition of Oritius. In England the reading obtained a wide currency, being actually adopted in all the versions in general use previous to that of 1611, viz. those of Tyndale, Coverdale, Taverner, the Bishops Bible, and the Geneva Version. The Authorized Version relegated it to the margin, from which it has been happily excluded by the Revisers, and thus, it is to be hoped, it has finally disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill, and desire to have.</span> The combination is certainly strange. Dean Scott sees in the terms a possible allusion to "the well-known politico-religious party of the zealots," and <span class="accented">suggests</span> the rendering, "<span class="accented">ye</span> play the murderers and zealots." It is, perhaps, more probable that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> simply refers to covetousness; cf. the use of the word (although with a better meaning) in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>.

The same word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) is used as a feminine adjective by our Lord in the expression, "<span class="accented">an</span> evil and adulterous generation" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>); and in this possibly lies the explanation of St. James's use of the term. More probably, however, it should be accounted for as a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-45.htm">Ezekiel 23:45</a>, where we read of Samaria and Jerusalem under the titles of Aholah and Aholibah: "The righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; <span class="accented">because they are adulteresses</span>, and blood is in their <span class="accented">hands."</span> It is remarkable too that in <a href="../../par/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a> the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, although the Hebrew has the masculine, and <span class="accented">men</span> are evidently referred to. If, then, in the Old Testament the Jewish communities were personified as adulteresses, it is not unnatural for St. James to transfer the epithet to those Judaeo-Christian communities to which he was writing; and the word should probably be taken, just as in the Old Testament, of spiritual fornication, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apostasy from God, shown in this case, not by actual idolatry, but by that "<span class="accented">friendship</span> of the world" which is "enmity with God," and by "<span class="accented">covetous</span>ness which is idolatry." <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.

True that <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a> teaches us that God is a "<span class="accented">jealous God</span>," but there the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span> by the far nobler word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>: cf.

The quotation is from <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. St. James's version agrees with this exactly, except that it has <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the Hebrew has simply "he," ran). The passage is also quoted in precisely the same form by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>), and with <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> by St. Clement of Rome. In St. Peter the quotation is followed by the injunction, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God .... Your adversary <span class="accented">the devil</span>, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: <span class="accented">whom withstand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) steadfast in the faith." There is clearly a connection between this passage and the one before us in St. James, which proceeds, "Be subject therefore unto God; but <span class="accented">resist the devil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>), and he will flee from you." This passage, it will be felt, is the simpler, and therefore, probably, the earlier of the two (cf. <a href="../../par/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a>).

The whole form of expression also reminds us of St. Paul's "treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>), to which it is exactly parallel, the "wrath in the day of wrath" there answering to the "fire in the last days" here.

If the words are connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> as suggested above, there is no difficulty in them. If the punctuation of the A.V. be retained, we must suppose that the writer is speaking from the point of view of the last day of all. "When the end came it found them heaping up treasures which they could never use" (Dean Scott). But the other view, though not so generally adopted, seems fat' preferable.

Let us condemn him with a shameful death." It is probable, then, that passages such as these were in St. James's mind, and suggested the words, and thus that there is no direct allusion to the Crucifixion (which, indeed, could scarcely be laid to the charge of his readers), but that the singular <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used to denote the class collectively (cf. <a href="../../par/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>).

He, like his Master, "lays down rules and maxims and principles without specifying the limitations and exceptions." The sermon on the mount, as interpreted by our Lord's own actions, is a clear witness that this formed <span class="accented">Ms</span> method of teaching. If, then, his words do not touch the case of oaths solemnly tendered to men in a court of justice (and his own acceptance of an adjuration on his trial shows that they do <span class="accented">not</span>), no more do St. James's. Both our Lord and his apostle had probably in view "only those profane adjurations with which men who have no deep-seated fear of God garnish their common talk" (see Sadler's 'Commentary on St. Matthew,' p. 66). The special oaths mentioned were those in vogue among the Jews, and just the very ones which our Lord himself had specified (comp. Lightfoot's 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 2. p. 127, edit. Gandell). On the need of such teaching as this, see Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 190: "This people are fearfully profane. Everybody curses and swears when in a passion. No people that I have ever known can compare with these Orientals for profaneness in the use of the names and attributes of God. The evil habit seems inveterate and universal. When Peter, therefore, 'began to curse and to swear' on that dismal night of temptation, we are not to suppose that it was something foreign to his former habits. He merely relapsed, under high excitement, into what, as a sailor and a fisherman, he had been accustomed to all his life. The people now use the very same sort of oaths that are mentioned and condemned by our Lord. They swear by the head, by their life, by heaven, by the temple, or what is in its place, the church. The forms of cursing and swearing, however, are almost infinite, and fall on the pained ear all day long." So, too, Aben Ezra speaks of the practice of swearing as almost universal in his day, so that he says, "men swear daily countless times, and then swear that they have not sworn!" With regard to the translation of the verse, two renderings are possible: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of the A.V. and of the R.V. (text), "Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of the R.V. margin, "Let yours be the yea, yea, and the nay, nay;" viz. those enjoined by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>), "Let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." On behalf of this latter rendering, may be pleaded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the clearness of the reference to our Lord's teaching; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the fact that this is the interpretation given to the clause in the two leading versions of antiquity, the Syriac and the Vulgate, both of which have exactly the same words here and in St. Matthew.

(From the manner in which this last clause is introduced, it may fairly be inferred that the sins in question are presumed to have had some connection with the sickness, and to have been its cause. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et si in peccatis sit dimittentur</span> cf.) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Anointing him with oil in the Name of the Lord</span>.

A similar use is also found in the Epistles of Ignatius. The Vatican Manuscript, however, appears to stand quite alone in this reading here. If the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, be admitted, they must be taken as referring to the Lord Jesus (contrast ver. 10, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). So also in ver. 15 the Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) who shall raise him up is clearly the Lord Jesus. Had God the Father been alluded to we should probably have had the anarthrous <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> after the manner of the LXX. (see note on James 4:10). Unction is mentioned in connection with the sick also in <a href="../../par/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>. The apostles "anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them;" and compare the parable of the good Samaritan (<a href="../../par/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>), "<span class="accented">pouring</span> in wine and oil." "<span class="accented">Josephus</span> mentions that among the remedies employed in the case of Herod, he was put into a sort of oil bath.... The medicinal use of oil is also mentioned in the Mishna, which thus exhibits the Jewish practice of that day" ('Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. it. p. 595; see Mishna, 'Shabbath,' 13:4; and compare Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. it. p. 415). According to Tertullian, "<span class="accented">the</span> Christian Proculus, surnamed Torpacion, the steward of Euhodus," cured with oil Severus, the father of Antonino (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Caracalla), who "<span class="accented">in</span> gratitude kept him in his palace till the day of his death." Tertullian, 'Ad Scapulam,' c. 4. (see Oehler's notes on the passage). But in the case before us if, as in these other instances, the oil was used as an actual remedy, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> why was it to be administered by the elders? and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> why is the healing immediately afterwards attributed to "the prayer of faith"? These questions would seem to suggest that oil was enjoined by St. James rather as an outward symbol than as an actual remedy. A further question remains to which a few lines must be devoted. Is the apostle prescribing a rite for all times? On the one hand, we are told that the use of oil was connected with the miraculous powers of healing, and therefore ceased "when those powers ceased" (cf. Bishop Browne on the Articles, p. 589). On the other hand, the passage is appealed to as warranting the Roman Catholic sacrament of extreme unction. With regard to the practice of the early Church, there is a constant stream of testimony to the use of oil <span class="accented">for purposes of healing</span>; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the case in Tertullian already quoted, and many others in the fourth and fifth centuries (see 'Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' pp. 1455, 2004, 2053). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as originally practiced it was administered by laymen and even by women. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> After the <span class="accented">blessing</span> of the oil was restricted to bishops it was still regarded as immaterial by whom the unction was performed. So Psalm-Innocent, 'Ep. ad Decent.,' &sect; 8, "Being made by the bishop, it is lawful not for priests only, but for all Christians, to use it in anointing in their own need or in that of their friends." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Not till the middle of the ninth century do we meet with any express injunction to the priest to perform the unction himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "The restraint of the unction to the priest had momentous consequences. The original intention of it in relation to healing of the body was practically forgotten, and the rite came to be regarded as part of a Christian's immediate preparation for death. Hence in the twelfth century it acquired the name of 'the last unction,' <span class="accented">unctio extrema</span> (Peter Lombard, ' Sent.,' 4:23), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Catechism of Trent asserts ('De Extr. Unct.,' 3), the last of those which a man received from the Church. In the thirteenth it was placed by the schoolmen among the seven rites to which they limited the application of the term sacrament" ('Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' p. 2004). In the sixteenth century it was definitely laid down at the Council of Trent, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is a sacrament instituted by our Lord; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that by it grace is conferred, sin remitted, and the sick comforted, "sometimes also" the recovery of health is obtained; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it should be given to those in danger of death, but if they recover they may receive it again (Session 14. c. 9.). Further, the Catechism of the Council condemns as a grievous error the practice of waiting to anoint the sick "until all hope of recovery being now lost, life begins to ebb, and the sick person to sink into lifeless insensibility." In spite of this, however, the common practice in the Roman Catholic Church at the present day appears to be to administer the rite only to persons <span class="accented">in extremis.</span> Turning now to the Eastern Church, we notice that a rite of unction has been continued there up till the present time. The service, which is a somewhat lengthy one, may be seen in Daniel's 'Codex Liturgicus,' bk. 4. c.v.; and cf. Neale's 'Holy Eastern Church,' Introd., vol. it. p. 1035, where it is noted that it differs from the Western use in three points: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the oil is not previously consecrated by the bishop, but at the time by seven priests; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the unction is not conferred only <span class="accented">in extremis</span>, but in slighter illness, and if possible in the church; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is not usually considered valid unless at least three priests are present to officiate. It has been thought well to give this slight historical sketch, as affording the best answer to the claims of Romanists by showing how they have gradually departed from the primitive custom and changed the character of the rite. But the sketch will also have shown that it is scarcely accurate to imply that unction ceased when the miraculous powers ceased. At the Reformation, when the English Church wisely rejected the mediaeval service for extreme unction, she yet retained in the first English Prayer-book a simple form of unction, to be used "if the sick person desire it," consisting of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> anointing, "upon the forehead or breast only," with the sign of the cross; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> prayer for the inward anointing of the soul with the Holy Ghost, and for restoration of bodily health and strength. Thus the service was entirely primitive in character, and it is hard to see what valid objection could be raised to it. It was, however, omitted from the second English Prayer-book of 1552, and has never been restored. The justification, I suppose, of this disuse of unction must be sought in the entire absence of evidence that the primitive Church understood the passage before us as instituting a religious rite to be permanently continued.

It is difficult to know exactly what to make of this injunction to confess "one to another," which is stated in the form of an inference from the preceding. The form of the expression, "one to another," and the perfectly general term, "a righteous man," forbid us to see in it a direct injunction to confess to the clergy, and to the clergy only. But on the other hand, it is unfair to lose sight of the fact that it is directly connected with the charge to send for the elders of the Church. Marshall, in his' Penitential Discipline,' is perfectly justified in saying that St. James "hath plainly supposed the presence of the elders of the Church, and their intercession to God for the sick penitent, and then recommended the confession of his faults in that presence, where two or three assembled together in the Name of Christ might constitute a Church for that purpose" ('Penit. Discipline,' p. 80). We may, perhaps, be content with saying, with Bishop Jeremy Taylor, "When St. James exhorts all Christians to confess their sins one to another, certainly it is more agreeable to all spiritual ends that this be done rather to the curate of souls than to the ordinary brethren" ('Dissuasive from Popery,' II. 1:11; cf. Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 6. 4:5, 7). <span class="cmt_word">The effectual fervent prayer</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">the petition of a righteous man availeth much in its working.</span> On the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> the narrower, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> the wider word, see Trench on ' Synonyms,' p. 179.

Winer, p. 584). For the incident alluded to by St. James, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>; but note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that we are never told that the famine was in consequence of Elijah's prayer; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> nothing is said of the duration of time (three years and a half) during which it rained not upon the earth. All we read is that "after many days the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year;" but there is no clear indication from what period this "third year" is dated. With regard to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, it may have been St. James's own inference from the narrative, or may have been due to tradition.

And as the same period is said to be given in the Yalkut Shimeoni on <a href="../../par/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16</a>, it was probably the time handed down by tradition, being taken by the Jews as a symbol of times of tribulation (cf. <a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>).

Probably the one was consciously or unconsciously influenced by the other. The striking position which the words occupy <span class="accented">here</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> those with which the Epistle closes, would make them linger in the memory; and there is nothing to militate against the conclusion, which appeared probable on the occasion of previous coincidences between the two writers, that St. James is the earlier of the two (comp. on James 4:6). The expression used by the apostle leaves it undetermined <span class="accented">whose</span> sins are thus "covered," whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> those of the man who is "<span class="accented">converted</span> from the error of his way," or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those of the man who wins him back, and through this good action obtains, by the grace of God, pardon for his own "multitude of sins." It has been well noticed that "<span class="accented">there</span> is a studied generality in the form of the teaching which seems to emphasize the wide blessedness of love. In the very act of seeking to convert one for whom we care we must turn to God ourselves, and in covering the past sins of another our own also are covered. In such an act love reaches its highest point, and that love includes the faith in God which is the condition of forgiveness" (Plumptre). The Epistle ends abruptly, with no salutation and no doxology. In this it stands almost by itself in the New Testament; the First Epistle of St. John alone approaching it in the abruptness of its conclusion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../james/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="James 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="James 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_peter/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Peter 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Peter 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
