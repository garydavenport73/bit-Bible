The word of the Lord is heavy and full of threats, but, as St. Jerome notes, it is also consolatory, because it is not "against" but to Israel. By this name the whole covenanted nation is designated, here, perhaps, with some idea of reminding the people of Jacob's faith and patience, and stimulating them to imitate their great ancestor. <span class="cmt_word">By Malachi;</span> literally, <span class="accented">by the hand of Malachi</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>). That Malachi is the proper name of the prophet, and not a mere official designation, see the proof in the Introduction, &sect; II. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "by the hand of his angel," or" messenger," and some curious theories have been founded on this translation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that an angel was the real author of the book, or came and explained it to the people. A similar legend once obtained concerning Haggai, called" The Lord's Messenger" (<a href="../../par/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>). At the end of the verse the LXX. adds, "fix it in your hearts," which Jerome supposes to have been imported hither from <a href="../../par/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">I have loved you, saith the LORD.

God had shown his love for Israel by electing them to be his people, and by his treatment of them during the whole course of their history. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein hast thou loved us!</span> This was the inward feeling of the people at this time. They doubted God's love and faithfulness. Events had not turned out as they expected. They had, indeed, returned from captivity, and the temple was rebuilt; but none of the splendid things announced by the prophets had come to pass. They were not great and victorious; Messiah had not appeared. Therefore they repined and murmured: they were ungrateful for past favours, and questioned God's power and providence. <span class="cmt_word">Was not Esau Jacob's brother?</span> God refutes their unjust charge by referring them to a palpable fact, viz. the different fate of the descendants of the twin brothers, Esau and Jacob. How miserable the destiny of the Edomites! how comparatively fortunate the condition of the Israelites! <span class="cmt_word">Yet I loved Jacob.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I hated Esau.</span> St. Paul quotes these words (<a href="../../par/romans/9-13.htm">Romans 9:13</a>) in order to illustrate his position, "that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth." Even before his birth Jacob was the chosen one, and Esau, the elder, was to serve the younger. This mystery of Divine election has seemed to some to be stated so harshly that they have thought that the words of the text need to be softened, or to be modified by their explanation. Thus they give the glosses, "I have preferred Jacob to Esau;" "I have loved Esau less than Jacob;" or they have limited the terms "love" end "hatred" to the bestowing or withholding of temporal blessings; or they have affirmed that Esau was hated because God foresaw his unworthiness, and Jacob was beloved owing to his foreseen piety and faithfulness. The whole question is discussed by Augustine, 'De Div. Quint. ad Simplic.,' 1:18 (11:433). He ends by saying, "Deus odit impietatem: in aliis etiam punit  per damnationem, in aliis adimit per justificationem." But Malachi is not speaking of the predestination of the one brother and the reprobation of the other; he is contrasting the histories of the two peoples represented by them; as Jerome puts it, "In Jacob vos dilexi, in Esau Idumaeos odio habui." Both nations sinned; both are punished; but Israel by God's free mercy was forgiven and restored, while Edom was left in the misery which it had brought upon itself by its own iniquity. Thus is proved God's love for the Israelites (Knabenbauer). That it is of the two nations that the prophet speaks, rather than of the two brothers, is seen by what follows. <span class="cmt_word">Laid his mountains...  waste.</span> While the Israelites were repeopling and cultivating their land, and their cities were rising from their ruins, and the temple and the capital were rebuilt, Edom, which had suffered at the hand of the same enemies, had never recovered from the blow, and still lay a scene of desolation and ruin. It seems that Nebuchadnezzar attacked and conquered Edom some few years after he had taken Jerusalem. This event happened during one of his expeditions against Egypt, one of which took place in the thirty-seventh year of his reign, as we learn from a record lately deciphered (see 'Transact. of Soc. of Bibl. Archaeology,' 7:210, etc.).

The prophet commences with a general principle which every one allows, and argues from that what was the attitude which they ought to assume towards God. <span class="cmt_word">A father.</span> God was the Father of Israel by creation, election, preservation, watchful guardianship (see <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">My fear.</span> The fear, respect, reverence, due to me. <span class="cmt_word">O priests.</span> He addresses his reproof to the priests, as the representatives of the people, and bound to lead them to obedience and holiness, and to be a pattern to the flock. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein have we despised thy Name?</span> The priests have grown so callous, and have so obscured true religion by Pharisaical externalism, that they profess to be utterly unconscious how they have shown contempt of God.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD <i>is</i> contemptible.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye offer polluted bread</span> (<span class="accented">food</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>upon mine altar.</span> The prophet answers the priests simply by detailing some of their practices. The "bread" (<span class="accented">lechem</span>) is not the shewbread, which was not offered on the altar, but the flesh of the offered victims (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-25.htm">Leviticus 22:25</a>). This was "polluted" in that it was not offered in due accordance with the ceremonial Law, as is further explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein have we polluted thee?</span> They did not acknowledge the truth that (as St. Jerome says) "when the sacraments are violated, he himself, whose sacraments they are, is violated" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The table of the Lord is contemptible.</span> This was the thought of their heart, if they did not give open expression to it in words. The "table of the Lord" (ver. 12) is the altar, on which were laid the sacrifices,  regarded as the food. of God, and to be eaten by the fire (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>). They showed that they despised the altar by fancying that anything was good enough for offering thereon, as the next verse explains. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, <i>is it</i> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, <i>is it</i> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye offer the blind.</span> The Law ordered that the victims should be perfect and without blemish (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19-25</a>). Is it not evil! It is more forcible to read this without the interrogation, "It is no evil!" and to regard it as the priests' thought or word, here introduced by the prophet in bitter irony. Their conscience had grown so dull, and they had become so familiarized with constant dereliction of duty, that they saw no wrong in these violations of the Law, and never recalled the people to their duty in these matters. <span class="cmt_word">Offer it now unto thy governor.</span> The word for "governor" is <span class="accented">pechah</span>, as in <a href="../../par/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> (where see note). It denotes a ruler set over a province by a Persian king. As Nehemiah had refused to be burdensome to the people (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14-18</a>), it is thought that Malachi must have written this when some other person was acting as governor. But Nehemiah's generosity was exhibited in his earlier administration, and he may have thought it right to take the dues under a more prosperous state of affairs. The prophet may be putting the ease generally - Would you dare offer such things to your governor? At any rate, the question is not about provisions and dues supplied to the governor and liable to be exacted by him in his official capacity, but about voluntary offerings and presents, without which no inferior would presume to appear before his prince (see Introduction, &sect; II.). To offer to such a one what was mean and defective would be nothing less than an insult; and yet they thought this was good enough for God. <span class="cmt_word">Accept thy person.</span> Regard thee with favour (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-10.htm">Job 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>).

Others interpret, "The thing depends on you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether God shows favour or not. <span class="cmt_word">Will he regard your persons?</span> Will he show favour to any one because ye intercede for him?

I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The prophet continues his severe reprobation of the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for naught,</span> etc.? Thus rendered, the passage rebukes the mercenary spirit of the priests, who would not even shut the temple door nor kindle the altar fire unless they were paid for it; or else it means that, though all the officers of the temple were remunerated for their most trivial services, yet they were remiss in attending to their duties, and neglected the law of sacrifices. The Latin Version omits the negative in the last clause, <span class="accented">Quis est in vobis qui claudat ostia, et incendat altare meum gratuito?</span> The LXX., with some little variation in the reading, renders, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "Wherefore also among you the doors shall be shut, and my altar shall not be kindled for nothing," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God threatens that the temple services shall wholly cease. But it is best to consider the passage as continuing the sarcastic strain of the preceding verse, and saying in effect that it would be better to have no pretence of worship at all than to have it thus profaned. Translate as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain!</span> The doors are those of the inner court of the temple, where the great altar stood; and the polluted sectaries is offered "in vain," because it offends God rather than propitiates him. <span class="cmt_word">An offering</span> (<span class="accented">minchah</span>). Here not sacrifice in general, as many commentators suppose, because it would be unnatural to take the word in one sense in this verse, and in a different sense in the following, where it is confessedly used in its restricted signification. The term is applied technically to the offering of fine flour combined with off and frankincense, burnt on the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, etc.); though it is also occasionally used even of bloody sacrifices; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Abel's (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-17.htm">1 Samuel 2:17</a>). As liturgically employed, it denotes the unbloody offering. So in this verse we may note a kind of climax. God would not accept the victims sacrificed, no, nor even the meat offering, which was naturally pure and unpolluted, 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <i>shall be</i> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <i>shall be</i> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <i>shall be</i> great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My Name shall be great.</span> The course of thought is this: God does not need the worship of the Jews and their impious priests; he needs not their maimed sacrifices; his majesty shall be recognized throughout the wide world, and pure worship shall be offered to him from every nation under heaven. How, then, shall he not punish those who, being his elect, ought to have been an example of holiness, and  prepaid the way for his universal reception? The LXX. treats this circumstance as already occurring at this time, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "My Name hath been and is glorified." This could only be said if it was allowed that the heathen in some sense, however blindly and imperfectly, did worship the true God. But the notion cannot be upheld for a moment; and there is a general consensus of commentators in referring the time to the Messianic future, when God's power is acknowledged and worship offered to him, not in Jerusalem alone, but in every place. The participles in this verse may be rendered by presents or futures, but there can be little doubt that a prophecy is intended, and not a statement of a fact - which, indeed, could not be truthfully maintained. When such a future is in stere, is this a time for Jewish priests to dishonour Jehovah? <span class="cmt_word">Incense shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering</span> (<span class="accented">minchah</span>). The universal worship is expressed in the terms of the Jewish ritual (see note on Zephaniah 3:10). The Hebrew is more forcibly rendered, <span class="accented">In every place incense is burned, oblation made unto my Name, and indeed a pure oblation.</span> Incense is to our minds a type of prayer (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>, etc.); the pure oblation is the symbol of the Christian sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; and the prophet, rising superior to Jewish prejudices, announces that this prayer and sacrifice shall no longer be confined to one place or one specially favoured country, but be universal, worldwide. The Fathers and mediaeval writers, and many modern commentators, see in this verse a prophecy of the Holy Eucharist, the "pure offering" commemorative of Christ's sacrifice, which is found in every nation under heaven where the Name of Christ is adored.

The threat or announcement is called a commandment, because God ordains it and imposes its execution on certain instruments. (For the expression, camp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-21.htm">Leviticus 25:21</a>.) The threat is contained in vers. 2, 3.

These God would not ratify, but would turn them into curses, and thus punish the people who connived at and imitated the iniquities of the priests. Or the expression may refer to the material benefits promised by God to the Israelites on their obedience. But as the announcement is made specially to the priests, this explanation seems less probable. <span class="cmt_word">I have cursed them already.</span> The curse has already begun to work. Dr. S. Cox ('Bible Educator,' 3:67, etc.) points out here an allusion to <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1, 2</a>, wherein it is recorded that they reed from the Book of Moses how that the Moabites "hired Balsam against them that he should curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing." Malachi, who, as he thinks, was present on this occasion, may have been deeply impressed by these words; and it is probable that we hear an echo of them in the threat of ver. 2. "That of old God had turned a curse into a blessing, may have suggested the menace that he would now turn a blessing into a curse."

God would mar the promise of their crops; but, as the priests did not concern themselves with agriculture, such a threat would have had no particular application to them. It is best, therefore, to take the pointing of some of the versions, and to translate, <span class="accented">I will rebuke your arm</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will take from you the power of performing, or, I will neutralize your official duties, the arm being the instrument of labour, offering, and blessing. Others consider the threat  to be that they should be deprived of their allotted portion of the sacrifice - the breast and shoulder (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31, 32</a>), or the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the maw (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>).

The covenant with Levi was the election of that tribe to be the ministers of the sanctuary. There is here a special allusion to the blessing pronounced on Phinehas for his conduct in the matter of Zimri (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-12.htm">Numbers 25:12, 13</a>). This election is called "a covenant," because, while conferring certain privileges, it involved certain duties. The difficulty in this interpretation is that the verb used here (<span class="accented">hayah</span>) does not mean "to remain," "to continue," but only "to be, to exist." Hence many critics take "the commandment" as the subject, translating. "That it (my purpose) may be my covenant with Levi, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that as God observed the covenant made with the tribe of Levi in old time, so for the future this commandment and threat will be as vigorously observed and take the place of the old covenant. This explanation is too involved and refined to be acceptable. It is easiest to translate, with Henderson and Reinke, "Because my covenant was with Levi," and to understand God as implying that he warned and punished the priests, because he willed that the covenant with Levi should hold good, and he thus desired to have a body of priests who would keep their vows and maintain the true priestly character. What that character is he procoeds to unfold. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him <i>for</i> the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">In contrast with these evil ministers, the character of the true priest is sketched, and thus the faults of the former are shown in darker colours.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My covenant was with him of life and peace;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with him was life and peace.</span> This is one side of the covenant, that which God gave - the blessing of life, abundance, prosperity, and secure and undisturbed enjoyment of these, in the everlasting priesthood, in agreement with the promise to Phinehas (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-12.htm">Numbers 25:12</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I gave them to him for the fear</span>, etc. I gave him life and peace. The pronominal suffix "them" is not expressed in the Greek and Latin Versions, and is absent from many Hebrew manuscripts, which read, "I gave him fear." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dedi eis timorem et timuit me</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, "I gave him the fear of me." This expresses man's part in the covenant: God gave him certain blessings on condition that he feared, reverenced, worshipped, and obeyed the Lord. The last part of the verse as now read is more simply explained, "and (my covenant with him was, or, I gave him) fear, and he did fear me." God's gifts were life and peace. Levi's part was fear of God: this he performed. The ideal priest observed all the duties of piety and reverence, and therefore in his case the covenant stood firm and was duly carried out.

He starts with a general principle, here assuming an interrogative form, and on it builds his rebuke. The priests were guilty, if not of profane marriages, at any rate of sinful neglect in not warning the people against them. Many take the "one father" to be Abraham (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>), and it is no objection to this view that he was also the progenitor of Ishmaelites, Edomites, etc., because there was at this time no question about marriage with these nations, but with Canaanites, Moabites, Egyptians, and so on. But the parallelism with the following clause shows that by the Father is meant Almighty God (comp. <a href="../../par/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath not one God created us?</span> Hath not God taken us as his peculiar people, so as to call us his sons and his firstborn (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>)? Of course, God created all men; but the Jews alone recognized him as Creator. The prophet's proposition is that all Israelites were spiritual brothers and sisters, equally loved and chosen by God. From this he argues that in sinning against one another, they offended their common Father, and broke the family compact. <span class="cmt_word">Deal treacherously.</span> Act faithlessly against one another. He does not yet say in what this treachery consists, but adds, <span class="cmt_word">by profaning the covenant of our fathers</span>. He unites himself with them, because he suffered in their sin. They violated the covenant by which God chose them to be his peculiar people and placed himself in mysterious relation to them, on condition that they should keep themselves aloof from the evil nations around them, and avoid all connection with them and their practices. By intermarriages with the heathen, they profaned this covenant. This evil was one which Ezra had done his best to eradicate, using most stringent measures for its suppression (<a href="../../par/ezra/9.htm">Ezra 9, 10</a>.); Nehemiah, too, contended against those who had contracted these marriages, when he found on his return to Jerusalem many such transgressors (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23-28</a>); and now the prophet lifts up his voice in the cause of purity and obedience. The warning against throe mixed unions is found in <a href="../../par/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a>, 18.

But some critics would here cancel the word "Israel," as being a clerical error (see note, <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a>).

Many consider that by the "sanctuary" is meant the temple, into which these heathen wives had penetrated,  either led by curiosity or introduced by their profane husbands. But we have no knowledge that this was the case. It is better to take "the sanctuary," or that which is holy unto the Lord, to be the chosen nation itself, the community beloved by God, which was holy by election and profession, even as Christians are commonly called saints in the Epistles.

In this case the term "cut off" must be taken in some milder sense than "exterminate." The present text, however, seems to be a kind of alliterative proverbial saying to express totality, everybody; though whence it arose, and what is its exact signification, are matters of great uncertainty. Some take the phrase to mean," every waking and speaking person," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every living soul. The English and Latin Versions proceed on the assumption (which Pusey denies) that the first verb can be taken actively, "he that awakeneth," the teacher being so called as stimulating the scholar, who is named "the answerer." The Targum and Syriac explain it by "son and son's son." Of the various suggestions offered, the most probable is that it is a military phrase derived from the challenge of the sentinels and the answer thereto, which in time came to de. note the whole inhabitants of a camp or city. <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacles</span>. The dwellings. Or the word, as Dr. Cox supposes, may belong to the original saying, and have come down from the remote period when the Israelites lived in tents. <span class="cmt_word">And him that offereth an offering</span> (<span class="accented">michchah</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord of hosts.</span> The same punishment shall fall on one who offers even an oblation of meal for men who are guilty of this sin. This sin would appertain specially to the priests. Or we may take the clause in a general sense. God will cut off every such transgressor, even if he try to propitiate the Lord by making an offering before trim (Ecclus. 35. [32] 12), "Do not think to corrupt with gifts; for such he will not receive: and trust not to unrighteous sacrifices; for the Lord is Judge, and with him is no respect of persons."

The prophet replies, <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord hath been witness,</span> etc. The sin is now disclosed. Their marriages had been made before God; he who first instituted matrimony (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>) was a witness of the contract and gave it his sanction (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/31-50.htm">Genesis 31:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The wife of thy youth.</span> Whom thou didst marry when thine affections were pure and fresh, and for whom thy love was strong and simple (<a href="../../par/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Against whom thou hast dealt treacherously;</span> Septuagint, "whom thou hast deserted." This wife of thine thou hast betrayed, breaking faith with her by repudiating her. The wife of thy covenant. With whom thou didst make a solemn vow and covenant, to violate which is a monstrous crime. We have very little information respecting the religious ceremonies connected with a Jewish wedding. The previous espousal was a formal proceeding, conducted by friends  and parents, and confirmed by oaths. The actual marriage seems to have been accompanied by certain solemn promises and blessings (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/24-60.htm">Genesis 24:60</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11, 12</a>; Tobit 7:13; Smith, 'Dict. of Bible'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one?

Yet had he the residue of the spirit.</span> The passage has always been a <span class="accented">crux</span>, and has received many interpretations. The Anglican rendering (which, however, is probably not correct) is thus explained: God made at first one man and one woman, to show the oneness of marriage, and God gave man the breath of life and the residue to the woman; he made them both equally living souls; therefore divorce was never contemplated in the first institution of marriage. Others take "one" to mean Abraham, and explain: Abraham did not do so, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> did not repudiate his legitimate wife, though barren; and he had a share of the spirit of right, or he had excellence of spirit. But these are very forced interpretations, and do not occur naturally from a consideration of the words. The Hebrew may be translated more satisfactorily, Not any one has done so who has a remnant of the spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>)." No one acts as you have done who has in him any of that Divine life which God at first breathed into man; in other words, no man of conscience and virtue has ever thus divorced his wife. The reading of the Septuagint varies here, the Vatican manuscript giving, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>; "Did he not well?" and the Alexandrian, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: but both seem to imply an interpretation such as we have just given. <span class="cmt_word">And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed.</span> Why did one act in this way? was it that he might have godly children? Surely not. No one would divorce his lawful Hebrew wife, and marry an idolatress, who wished to leave a holy posterity behind him. Many commentators, thinking that Abraham is here meant, and that the prophet is meeting an objection which might be founded upon his action with regard to Hagar, translate, "And what did the one? He was seeking a godly seed." Abraham at Sarah's request took Hagar to wife, in order to have the promised seed; he dismissed her in order to carry out the purpose of God in confining the promise to Isaac. Therefore his conduct is no support for those who repudiate their own wives and marry strange women, not to raise up children for God, but to satisfy their carnal lusts. It is difficult, however, to see how the prophet's hearers could have understood the allusion without further explanation. As Ribera pithily observes (quoted by Knabenbauer), "Neque ita clare ex re allata designatur (Abraham), ut non potius divinatione quam explicatione opus sit ad eum eruendum." It may also be remarked that the reference to the patriarch would not have been altogether successful, if the auditors remembered the Keturahites, who, though sprung from Abraham, were not "a godly seed." The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; "And ye said, What else than seed doth God seek?" as if the increase of population, from whatever source, was the only object required. This may have been one thought of the people, but it can hardly be got out of the present Hebrew text. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed to your spirit.</span> Beware lest ye lose the spirit which God has given you. By acting thus contrary to conscience and the light vouchsafed to them, they ran the risk of being deprived altogether of this heavenly guide, and losing all distinction between right and wrong. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for <i>one</i> covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hateth putting away.</span> This is another reason against divorce: God hates it. It is contrary to his original institution, and was only allowed for the hardness of men's hearts (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3-9</a>). Septuagint, "If thou hate her and dismiss her," etc.; Vulgate, "If thou hate her, put her away," which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned. Hence Jerome considers these words to be spoken by the Jews, quoting in their defence Moses' precept. Others think that they are ironical - Put her away, if you please; but you must bear the consequences. <span class="cmt_word">For one covereth violence with his garment.</span> He who thus divorces his wife shows himself openly to all beholders as an iniquitous man. So the clause is better rendered, <span class="accented">And one</span> (<span class="accented">who does so</span>) <span class="accented">covereth his garment with violence</span>, or, <span class="accented">violence</span> <span class="accented">covereth his garment.</span> Iniquity attaches itself to him plainly, encircling and enfolding him; the clothing of iniquity is the mark of the foul soul within. The notion of "garment" being here used figuratively for wife (as Hitzig supposes) is without proof. Such a metaphor is certainly unknown to Hebrew literature, though there is something like it in Arabic, "Wives are your attire, and ye are theirs" (Koran). Bishop Wordsworth considers that the phrase in the text refers to the custom of the bridegroom in espousals casting the skirt of his garment over her who was betrothed to him (see <a href="../../par/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>). So the idea would be, "Ye cast your skirt over iniquity, and betroth violence to yourselves for a bride." But this seems somewhat forced. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed...  treacherously.</span> A repetition of the warning in ver. 15.

Are they ready to meet him and to bear his sentence? Who this "messenger" is is disputed. That no angel or heavenly visitant is meant is clear from historical considerations, as no such event took place immediately before the Lord came to his temple. Nor can Malachi himself be intended, as his message was delivered nearly four, hundred years before Messiah came. The announcement is doubtless founded upon <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, and refers to the same person as the older prophet mentions, who is generally allowed to be John the Baptist, the herald of Christ's advent (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-10.htm">Matthew 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prepare the way before me.</span> The expression is borrowed from Isaiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span> (comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>).

The purifying consists not only in exterminating the evil, but also in correcting and improving all who are not wholly incorrigible.

When the impious made the above infidel remarks, the pious spake often, conversed together.

But it is difficult to conceive such words coming from the mouth of those who fear God; unless they are so called ironically.

The same opinion is found in the Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3, 6</a>), where one of the witnesses is very commonly supposed to be Elijah. It is argued by Keil, Reinke, and others, that, as the promise of King David in such passages as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, etc., cannot imply the resurrection of David and his return to earth, so we cannot think of an actual reappearance of Elijah himself, but only of the coming of some prophet with his spirit and power. But, as Knabenbauer points out, for the attribution of the name David to Messiah, long and careful preparation had been made; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> by his being called "the rod of Jesse," the occupant of David's throne, etc.; and all who heard the expression would at once understand the symbolical application, especially as David was known to have died and been buried. But when they found Malachi speaking of the reappearance of "Elijah <span class="accented">the prophet</span>," who, as they were well aware, had never died, of whose connection with the coming Messenger they had never heard, they could not avoid the conclusion to which they came, viz. that before the great day of judgment Elias should again visit the earth in person. This prophecy concerns the very last days, and intimates that before the final consummation, when iniquity shall abound, God will send this great and faithful preacher of repentance, whose mission shall have such effects that the purpose of God for the  salvation of Israel shall be accomplished. We may therefore assume that in the gospel the appellation "Elias" stands both for John and for Elijah himself; for the messenger who prepared the way for Christ's first advent, and for the prophet who was to convert the Israelites before the judgment day; for him who came in spirit and power, and him who shall come in bodily presence. <span class="cmt_word">The great and dreadful day.</span> The day of final judgment. No other crisis could be named in such terms (see <a href="../../par/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, whence the words are taken). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. <<THE END OF THE PROPHETS.>></div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall turn,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, taking the preposition, rendered "to," in the sense of "with," he shall convert one and all, fathers and children, young and old, unto the Lord. Or, in agreement with the versions, he shall bring back the Jews then living to the faith of their ancestors, who rejoiced to see the day of Christ (<a href="../../par/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>); and then the patriarchs, who for their unbelief had disowned them, shall recognize them as true Israelites, true children of Abraham. Others explain - He shall unite the Jews who are our fathers in the faith to us Christians who are their children (see <a href="../../par/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>, where the angel Gabriel quotes part of the passage, and applies it to John the Baptist). <span class="cmt_word">The heart.</span> Here not the seat of the intellectual powers, but of love and confidence, which lead to union and concord. <span class="cmt_word">Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse;</span> or, <span class="accented">smite the land with the ban.</span> This is an allusion to the ban threatened in the Law, which involved extermination (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-16.htm">Deuteronomy 13:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16, 17</a>). So Elijah shall come and preach repentance, as the Baptist did at Christ's first coming; and unless the Jews listen to him and turn to Christ, they shall be destroyed, shall share in that eternal anathema which shall fall on the ungodly at the day of judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../malachi/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Malachi 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Malachi 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
