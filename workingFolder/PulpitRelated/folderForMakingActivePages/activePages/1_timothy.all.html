Timothy was St. Paul's own son, because he had begotten him in the gospel (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>) - his spiritual son. This is best expressed as in the A.V. by "in the faith" (comp. <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>, where the same idea is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace, mercy, and peace.</span> This varies from the blessing at the beginning of the Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians, by the addition of the word "mercy," as in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a> in the T.R., and also in 2 John 3 and <a href="../../par/jude/1-2.htm">Jude 1:2</a>. It seems in St. Paul to connect itself with that deeper sense of the need and of the enjoyment of mercy which went with his deepening sense of sin as he drew towards his end, and harmonizes beautifully with what he says in vers. 12-16. The analogy of the other forms of blessing quoted above strongly favors the sense <span class="cmt_word">our Father</span> rather than <span class="accented">the Father</span>. Whether we read <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> with the T.R. or omit it with the R.T., the idea of <span class="accented">Father</span> is contrasted, not with that of <span class="accented">Son</span>, but with that of <span class="accented">Lord</span>; the two words express the relation of the Persons of the Godhead, not to each other, but to the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Exhorted</span> for <span class="accented">besought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tarry</span> for <span class="accented">abide still</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was going</span> for <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">certain men</span> for <span class="accented">some</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">not to teach a different</span> for <span class="accented">that they teach no other</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Exhorted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). In about sixty places this word has the sense of "beseech," "entreat," "desire," "pray," which is more suitable to this passage than the R.V. <span class="accented">exhort</span>. It is a strong expression, and seems to imply that Timothy had been anxious to go with St. Paul to Macedonia, to share his labors and wait upon him; but that St. Paul, with that noble disinterestedness which characterized his whole life, had, not without difficulty, persuaded him to abide at Ephesus. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry</span>. Here again the R.V. is unfortunate. The exact sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is "to stay on," or, as in the A.V., "to abide still." The word tells us that Timothy was already at Ephesus when he received the request from St. Paul to stay on there instead of going to Macedonia. There is nothing in the phrase that implies that St. Paul was at Ephesus himself when he made the request to Timothy. It may have been made by message or by letter. <span class="cmt_word">When I was going.</span> Some commentators have endeavored to explain <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as applying to Timothy, or as if the order were <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>; but the Greek will not admit of it. <span class="cmt_word">Charge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>); a word implying authority, almost invariably rendered "command" or "charge." It is taken up in ver. 18 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), "This charge," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Teach a different doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is one of the many words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles. It only occurs here and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>. It is formed from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a teacher of other than right doctrine, and means "to play the part of a teacher of other than right doctrine," just as in ecclesiastical language <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "one who holds opinions contrary to that which is orthodox," and such as do so are said <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. The classical sense is a little different, "one who holds a different opinion" - "to be of a different opinion." The introduction of the word into the vocabulary of Scripture is a sign of the somewhat later age to which this Epistle belongs, when heresies were growing and multiplying. Other similar compounds are <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).

If the spirit which gave birth to the fables of the Talmud was already at work among the Jews, we have a ready explanation of the phrase. And that they were Jewish fables (not later Gnostic delusions) is proved by the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>, "Not giving heed to Jewish fables." The prevalence of sorcery among the Jews at this time is a further instance of their inclination to fable (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Endless genealogies.</span> What was the particular abuse of genealogies which St. Paul here condemns we have not sufficient historical knowledge to enable us to decide. But that they were Jewish forms of "vain talking," and not Gnostic, and related to human pedigrees, not to "emanations of eons," may be concluded from the connection in which they are mentioned in <a href="../../par/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>, and from the invariable meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> itself. It is true that Irenaeus ('Contr. Haer.,' lib. 1.) applies this passage to the Valentinians and their succession of eons (Bythus, Nous, Logos, Anthropus, etc. - in all thirty, male and female); and so does Tertullian, who speaks of the seeds of the Gnostic heresies as already budding in St. Paul's days ('Advers Valentin.,' cap 3. and elsewhere), and Grotius supports thin explanation ('Comment.,' <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>). But it was very natural that Irenaeus and Tertullian, living when the heresies of Valentinus, Marcion, and others were at their height, should so accommodate St. Paul's words - which is all that Irenaeus does. On the other band, neither Irenaeus nor Tertullian shows that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was a word applied to the emanations of the eons in the Gnostic vocabulary. The genealogies, then, were Jewish pedigrees, either used <span class="accented">literally</span> to exalt individuals as being of priestly or Davidic origin (as the pedigrees of the Desposyni, or later of the princes of the Captivity), or used <span class="accented">cabbalistically</span>, so as to draw fanciful doctrines from the names composing a genealogy, or in some other way which we do not know of (see the writers 'Genealogies of Christ,' <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a>. &sect; 2:1; and note C at the end of the volume). <span class="accented">Endless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); found only here in the New Testament and so one of the words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles, but used in the LXX. for "infinite," "immeasurable." It means either "endless," "<span class="accented">interminable</span>," or, "having no useful end or purpose;" <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Chrysostom).

Taking the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, the phrase, "a dispensation of God which is in faith," must mean the gospel as delivered by revelation and received by faith. These fables and genealogies address themselves, the apostle says, to the disputatious, itching curiosity of men's minds, not to their faith. The substance of them is matter of doubtful disputation, not revealed truth. "<span class="accented">The</span> dispensation" <span class="accented">is</span> better English than "<span class="accented">a</span> dispensation." <span class="cmt_word">So do I now</span>; or, as the A.V., <span class="accented">so do</span>, is the conjectural filling up of the unfinished sentence which began "<span class="accented">as I</span> exhorted thee." But it is much more natural and simple to take ver. 18 as the apodosis, and the intermediate verses as a digression caused by St. Paul's desire to show how exactly the charge was in agreement with the true spirit of the Law of God.

In the case of Hymenaeus and Alexander (as in that of the incestuous person at Corinth), the punishment incident on this delivery to Satan would appear to have been short or' death, but in the case of the two first not to have had the effect of bringing them to a true repentance. <span class="cmt_word">Might be taught</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); viz. by correction and punishment, as children are taught (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-8</a>).

Sic., 16:55 it seems to mean "a request preferred in a personal interview," which is an extension of its common meaning in classical Greek of "access," "an interview," "social intercourse," or the like. But when we turn to the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> in the New Testament, we seem to get the idea of "intercession."  <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is to go to someone to ask him to take action <span class="accented">against</span> or <span class="accented">in favor of</span> some third party (see <a href="../../par/acts/25-24.htm">Acts 25:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27, 28, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>); and so Chrysostom (quoted in Steph., 'Thesaur.') explains <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to be the action of one who applies to God to avenge him of those who have done him wrong. So that perhaps "intercessions" is, on the whole, the best rendering here, though an imperfect one; and would comprise the prayers for the emperor, for the Church, for the sick, travelers, slaves, captives, etc., for the bishops, clergy, and laity, etc., and such prayers as "Turn away from us every plot (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) of wicked men" (Liturgy of St. Mark).

The transition from the personal <span class="accented">Eve</span> to the generic <span class="accented">woman</span> is further marked by the transition from the singular to the plural, "if they continue," etc. The natural and simple explanation of the passage is that the special temporal punishment pronounced against the woman, immediately after her sin, "In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children" (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>) - (to which St. Paul here evidently alludes) - and endured by all women ever since, was a set-off, so to speak, to the special guilt of Eve in yielding to the guile of the serpent; so that now the woman might attain salvation as well as the man (although she was not suffered to teach)if she continued in faith and charity. <span class="cmt_word">The child-bearing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); here only; but the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, which occurs in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>, is found (though very rarely) in classical Greek.

In spite of such <span class="accented">consensus</span>, it appears in the highest degree improbable that St. Paul should have laid down such a condition for the priesthood. There is nothing in his writings when treating expressly of second marriages (<a href="../../par/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-8.htm">1 Corinthians 7:8, 39</a>) to suggest the notion of there being anything disreputable in a second marriage, and it would obviously cast a great slur upon second marriages if it were laid down as a principle that no one who had married twice was fit to be an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. But if we consider the general laxity in regard to marriage, and the facility of divorce, which prevailed among Jews and Romans at this time, it must have been a common thing for a man to have more than one woman living who had been his wife. And this, as a distinct breach of the primeval law (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), would properly be a bar to any one being called to the "office of a bishop." The same case is supposed in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10-13</a>. But it is utterly unsupported by any single passage in Scripture that a second marriage should disqualify a man for the sacred ministry. As regards the opinion of the early Church, it was not at all uniform, and amongst those who held that this passage absolutely prohibits second marriages in the case of an <span class="accented">episcopus</span>, it was merely a part of the asceticism of the day. As a matter of course, such writers as Origen and Tertullian held it. The very early opinion that Joseph, the husband of Mary, had children by a former wife, which finds place in the Protevangelium of James (9.), is hardly consistent with the theory of the disreputableness of second marriages. In like manner, the phrase in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-9.htm">1 Timothy 5:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, is best explained in accordance with the apostle's doctrine about the lawfulness of a woman's second marriage, as meaning that she was the husband of one man only, as long as her husband lived. (For the chief patristic opinions on the subject, see Bishop Wordsworth's note, and Bingham's 'Christian Antiquities,' bk. 4. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5.htm">1 Timothy 5</a>.)

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to be sober" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).

"The faith" is equivalent to "the gospel," or "the kingdom of heaven," or the "godliness" of ver. 16 (where see note); and "the mystery of the faith" might be paraphrased by "the revealed truth of Christianity". What is added, "in a pure conscience," teaches us that orthodoxy without personal holiness is little worth. Holding "the truth in unrighteousness" is severely condemned by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). He says of himself (<a href="../../par/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>), "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5, 19</a>, etc.). It is much to be observed how St. Paul, the great teacher of the doctrine of g-race, lays constant stress upon the functions of the conscience, and the necessity of having a pure conscience.

It must he remembered that the office of the early deacon was in a great measure secular, so that there is nothing strange in that of the deaconess being coupled with it. The retrain in ver. 12 to the male deacon is in favor of understanding "the women" of the deaconesses, as showing that the subject of the diaconate was not done with.

It does not follow that St. Paul had in his mind their advancement from the "<span class="accented">inferior</span> office" to "<span class="accented">the</span> higher ministries in the Church" (Ordination Service); he may merely have meant to say that the discharge of the duties of a deacon in an efficient and exemplary manner raised a man to high estimation in the Church, and so gave him confidence in confessing the faith of Jesus Christ both by word and deed. <span class="accented">Gain to themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); acquire by purchase or otherwise. Frequent in the LXX.; but only elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Boldness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); very common in the New Testament (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 29, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>, etc.), where it is especially applied to boldness in preaching the gospel of Christ. This seems to imply that St. Paul contemplated <span class="accented">preaching</span> as a part of the deacon's work. We know that Philip the deacon and Stephen the deacon were both preachers.

It is literally "to go up and down" a given place, "backwards and forwards," hence "to dwell in it." The substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, in the thirteen places where it occurs in the New Testament, is always rendered "conversation" in the A.V.; in the R.V., "manner of life," "life," "issue of life," "<span class="accented">manner</span> of living," "<span class="accented">behaviour</span>," "living." It is a favorite word in the two Epistles of St. Peter, where it occurs eight times. <span class="cmt_word">The house of God.</span> This phrase here denotes, as it is explained in the following words, the Church on earth. So <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>, "<span class="accented">Christ</span> as a Son over his house; whose house are we," where the reference is to <a href="../../par/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, "<span class="accented">My</span> servant Moses... is faithful in all mine house." <span class="cmt_word">The Church of the living God.</span> Here is again a somewhat remarkable resemblance to the phraseology of the Epistle to the Hebrews, "Ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God.... to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22, 23</a>). However, the phraseology is not peculiar to the Epistle to the Hebrews. Thus we read in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, "<span class="accented">Ye</span> are the temple of the living God." The phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> living <span class="accented">God</span>," occurs seven times in St. Paul's Epistles, and four times in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It occurs three times in the Gospels, once in the Acts of the Apostles, and once in the Revelation. Here it is used by St. Paul to enhance the obligation to a holy and blameless walk in those who have the oversight of his Church. <span class="cmt_word">The pillar and ground of the truth</span>. Some apply these words to Timothy himself (Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, and others cited by Alford), after the analogy of <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>, where James, Cephas, and John are said to be "pillars" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, where it is said of him that over-cometh, "I will make him a pillar (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the house of my God." And so, in Venantius Fortunatus, St. Paul is called "stilus ille." But the metaphors of "a pillar" and "a foundation" do not all suit the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; and it is well argued that the absence of the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is unfavorable to the application of "the pillar and ground of the truth" to the subject of the first clause. It is therefore better to understand this clause as descriptive of the Church of God. The Church is the pillar of the truth. It supports it; holds it together - binds together its different parts. And it is the ground of the truth. By it the truth is made fast, firm, and fixed. <span class="cmt_word">The ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). This word only occurs here at all; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, common both in the New Testament, the LXX., and in classical Greek, means "fixed," "firm," or" fast." In the A.V. of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a> and 1 Cor 15:58, "steadfast;" <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (where it is coupled with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), "settled." Thence <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> in late Greek, "to make firm or fast," and <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the "establishment" or "grounding" of the truth; that in and by which the truth is placed on a sure and fixed basis.

It is always mysteries (or mystery) of the kingdom of God, of Christ, of God, of the gospel, and the like. In the following passages the objective sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is either necessary or by far the most natural: <a href="../../par/acts/3-7.htm">Acts 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-13.htm">Titus 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>. Having thus exalted the "mystery of godliness," St. Paul goes on to expound it. <span class="cmt_word">He who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>). This is generally adopted now as the true reading, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a3;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3a3;</span>). Bishop Ellicott satisfied himself, by most careful personal examination, that the original reading of the Cod. Alex. was <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a3;</span>, and that it had been altered by a later hand to <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3a3;</span>. The Cod. Sinait certainly has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>, and to this all the older versions agree. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">quod</span>, agreeing with <span class="accented">sacramentum</span> and representing the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> Accepting this, then, as the true reading, we proceed to explain it. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;</span>, who, is a relative, and must, therefore, have an antecedent. But there is no expressed antecedent of the masculine gender for it to agree with. The antecedent, therefore, must be understood, and gathered from the preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. It can only be Christ. The mystery of the whole Old Testament, that which was wrapped in types and hidden under veils, was Christ (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). Moses spake of him, the Psalms speak of him, the prophets speak of him; but all of them spake darkly. But in the gospel "the mystery of Christ" (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>)is revealed. Christ is the Mystery of Christianity. It is, therefore, no difficult step to pass from "the mystery" to "Christ," and to supply the word "Christ" as the antecedent to "who." <span class="cmt_word">Was manifested</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); a word frequently applied to Christ (<a href="../../par/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>, etc.). The idea is the same in <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Justified in the spirit.</span> This is rather an obscure expression. But it seems to describe our Lord's spotless righteousness, perhaps with special reference to the declaration of it at his baptism, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." We have the same contrast between the flesh and the Spirit of Christ in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>. And between the flesh and the spirit of a Christian man in <a href="../../par/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, "The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." To this clause apparently the remark of Chrysostom applies, "God became man, and man became God." "The spirit" seems to mean the moral nature - the inner man. <span class="cmt_word">Seen of angels.</span> Perhaps the multitude of the heavenly host who welcomed the birth of Christ were permitted to see the new-born Babe, as he seems to have done who described him to the shepherds as "wrapped in swaddling clothes" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-12.htm">Luke 2:12-14</a>). Angels ministered unto him after the temptation (<a href="../../par/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>), and in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>, where the word <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is used), and at his resurrection (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). The special interest of angels in the "<span class="accented">great mystery"</span> is referred to in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Preached among the nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). It would have been better to keep the rendering "Gentiles" here, to mark the identity of thought with <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6, 8</a>, where, in the apostle's view, the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, that they might be fellow-heirs with the Jews of the promises of God, is one main feature of the mystery (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believed on in the world.</span> The next step in this ascending scale is the acceptance of Christ in the world as the Savior thereof. The language here is not stronger than that of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 6</a>, "The word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world, and beareth fruit." And in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, "The gospel which was preached in all creation under heaven" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). The statement in <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-20</a> might almost have been in St. Paul's mind. Note the use there of the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Received up in glory.</span> The change of "into" (A.V.) into "in" is of very doubtful propriety. In New Testament Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, frequently follows verbs of motion, and means the same as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. Our Lord is net said to have ascended <span class="accented">in glory</span> (as he appeared at the Transfiguration), but, as St. Mark has it, "He was received up into heaven, and [there] sat down at the right hand of God," fulfilling <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. This grand burst of dogmatic teaching is somewhat like that in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-7</a>. There is no adequate evidence of its being, as many commentators have thought, a portion of a hymn or creed used in the Church. It rather implies the same tension in the apostle's mind which is apparent in other parts of the Epistle (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a> and following verses). <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_timothy/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Timothy 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Timothy 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_timothy/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Timothy 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Timothy 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm"><title>1 Timothy 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/1_timothy/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/1_timothy/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/1_timothy/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../1_timothy/3.htm" title="1 Timothy 3">&#9668;</a> 1 Timothy 4 <a href="../1_timothy/5.htm" title="1 Timothy 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">But</span> for <span class="accented">now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">saith</span> for <span class="accented">speaketh</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">later</span> for <span class="accented">the latter</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fall away</span> for <span class="accented">depart</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit saith expressly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and very rare in classical Greek.

The adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is only found here in the New Testament. But in the LXX.

The idea is "causing to wander," or "go astray." St. John warns his people against such deceiving spirits (<a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-6</a>).

But then the clause, "having their conscience seared with a hot iron," does not suit "devils." It is therefore, perhaps, best to translate the clause as the R.V. does, and to explain, with Bishop Ellicott, that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, which precedes <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, defines the <span class="accented">instrument</span> by which they were led to give heed to seducing spirits, viz. the hypocritical preterites of the men who spake lies, and whose consciences were seared.

The application of the image is somewhat uncertain. If the idea is that of "a brand," a mark burnt in upon the forehead of a slave or criminal, then the meaning is that these men have their own infamy stamped upon their own consciences. It is not patent only to others, but to themselves also. But if the metaphor is from the cauterizing a wound, as the A.V. takes it, then the idea is that these men's consciences are become as insensible to the touch as the skin that has been cauterized is. The metaphor, in this case, is somewhat similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, etc.). The latter interpretation seems to suit the general context best, and the medical use of the term, which St. Paul might have learnt from Luke. The emphasis of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "their own conscience," implies that they were not merely deceivers of others, but were self-deceived.

His meal consisted of a piece of bread, and a single mess of vegetables" ('Introd.,' p. 86). Professor Burton (in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "<span class="accented">to</span> give anything freely," gratuitously, of mere good will, without any payment or return (<a href="../../par/luke/7-42.htm">Luke 7:42</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, etc.). Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> came to be especially applied to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are preeminently "free gifts" (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20</a>). It is so applied in <a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4, 9, 28, 30, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>. Here, then, as in the similar passage, <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, the "<span class="accented">gift"</span> spoken of is the special grace given by the Holy Ghost to those who are separated for "<span class="accented">the</span> office and work of a priest in the Church of God by the imposition of hands" (Ordering of Priests). This gift St. Paul bids him <span class="cmt_word">not neglect</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The word contains the idea of contemptuous neglect - neglect as of an unimportant thing. In <a href="../../par/matthew/22-5.htm">Matthew 22:5</a> the persons invited to the feast made light of it, and went away to other things which they cared mere about. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and Hebrews 8:9, imply a contemptuous disregard. So here Timothy is reminded that in his ordination he received a great <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that he must value it duly, and use it diligently. It must not be let lie slumbering and smoldering, but must be stirred up into a flame. The lesson here and in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a> seems to be that we must look back to our ordination, and to the spiritual grace given in it, as things not exhausted. The grace is there, but it must not be lightly thought cf. <span class="cmt_word">Which was given thee by prophecy.</span> This seems to be explained by <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>, where Barnabas and Saul were separated for their work by the laying on of the hands apparently of the prophets and teachers, at the express command of the Holy Ghost, speaking doubtless by the mouth of one of the prophets. Timothy, it appears, was designated for his work by a like command of the Holy Ghost, speaking by one of the Church prophets, and received his commission by a like "<span class="accented">laying</span> on of hands" by the elders of the Church. If St. Paul refers, as he appears to do, to the same occasion in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, then it appears that he laid his hands on Timothy, together with the presbyters, as is done by the bishop in the ordination of priests. <span class="cmt_word">The presbytery</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The word is borrowed from the Jewish nomenclature (see <a href="../../par/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>; <span class="accented">Acts</span> 22:5). In a slightly different sense for "the office of a presbyter," Sus., 5:50 (Cod. Alex.).

A kindred use in classical Greek is "to practice" or "exercise" an art, as rhetoric, dancing, shooting with a bow, and the like. It is very common in the LXX., in the sense of "meditating," practicing in the thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">Give thyself wholly to them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">be in these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be wholly and always occupied with them.

The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> in the comment on the fourth commandment in <a href="../../par/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4-6</a>, where the withholding of the honor due consists in saying, "It is corban, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me," and so withholding the honor due, shows clearly that in the notion of <span class="accented">honoring is</span> included that material support which their condition as widows required. So again in ver. 17 of this chapter, the "<span class="accented">double</span> honor" due to elders who labor in the Word and doctrine is clearly shown by ver. 18 to include payment for their maintenance. This is also borne out by the frequent use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> in the sense of  "price" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-6.htm">Matthew 27:6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>, etc.). The passage might, therefore, be paraphrased, "Pay due regard to the wants of those widows who are widows indeed." The "honor" here prescribed would be exactly the opposite to the "neglect" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) complained of by the Grecian Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a>).

We learn from this passage that the care of widows by the whole Church, which began at Jerusalem in the very infancy of the Church, was continued in the Churches planted by St. Paul. We find the same institution though somewhat different in character, in subsequent ages of the Church. Widowhood, as well as virginity, became a religious profession, and widows were admitted with certain ceremonies, including the placing on their heads a veil consecrated by the bishop. Deaconesses were very frequently chosen from the ranks of the widows (Bingham, 'Antiq.,' bk. 7. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4.htm">1 Timothy 4</a>.).

Locke's phrase, "a nephew by a brother," seems to show the transition to the modern use of "nephew."

The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> had nourished and cared for them in their childhood; they must requite that care by honoring and supporting them in their old age. <span class="cmt_word">This is acceptable</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament or LXX., and rarely if ever in classical Greek.

A widow with children or grandchildren able to support her is not altogether desolate. As regards the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, rendered "now" both in the A.V. and the R.V., Bishop Ellicott rightly renders it "but." The apostle is contrasting the condition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, who has only God to look to for help, and who passes her time in prayer, with that of the widow with children and grandchildren. The second "but" in ver. 6 is no real objection; the widow who "giveth herself to pleasure ' is contrasted in her turn with the devout prayerful widow whose conduct has just been described. The inference intended to be drawn, as Ellicott justly remarks, is that the one is eminently fit, and the other eminently unfit, to be supported at the common charge of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Hath her hope set on God</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Supplications and prayers</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Night and day.</span> Perhaps <span class="accented">by night and by day</span> would express the genitive better (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-14.htm">Matthew 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>), as indicating time <span class="accented">when</span>, rather than time <span class="accented">how long</span>.

As regards the order of the words, "day and night," or "night and day," there seems to be no rule. St. Mark always has "night and day" (<a href="../../par/mark/4-7.htm">Mark 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a>); St. Luke uses both (<a href="../../par/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>).

We do not know enough of the Church institutions of the apostolic age to enable us to say positively what their status or their functions were, but doubtless they were the germ from which the later development (of which see Bingham, bk. 7. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4.htm">1 Timothy 4</a>.) took its rise. We may gather, however, from the passage before us that their lives were specially consecrated to the service of God and the Church; that they were expected to be instant and con-slant in prayer, and to devote themselves to works of charity; that the apostle did not approve of their marrying again after their having embraced this life of widowhood, and therefore would have none enrolled under sixty years of age; and generally that, once on the roll, they would continue there for their life. <span class="cmt_word">Enrolled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>); only here in the New Testament or (in this sense) in the LXX.; but it is the regular classical word for enrolling, enlisting, soldiers, etc. Hence our word "catalogue." In like manner, in the times of the Empress Helena, the virgins of the Church are described as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> (Socr., 1:17), "registered in the Church's register," or list of virgins. <span class="cmt_word">Under three score years old.</span> A similar rule was laid down in several early canons, which forbade the veiling of virgins before the age of <span class="accented">forty</span>. This care to prevent women from being entangled by vows or engagements which they had not well considered, or of which they did not know the full force, is in striking contrast with the system which allows young girls to make irrevocable vows. The participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, "being," belongs to this clause (not as in the A.V. to the following one), as Alford clearly shows, and as the R.V. also indicates, by putting <span class="accented">having been</span> in italics; though it does not translate <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in this clause, unless possibly the word "old" is considered as representing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>. It should <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">Let none be enrolled as widows</span>, <span class="accented">being under sixty years of age</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The wife of one man</span>; see above, <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, the similar phrase, "the husband of one wife" (which likewise stands without any participle), and the note there. To which may be added that it is hardly conceivable that St. Paul should within the compass of a few verses (see ver. 14) recommend the marriage of young widows, and yet make the fact of a second marriage an absolute bar to a woman being enrolled among the Church widows.

This is generally understood of some widows who had already given occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully, by turning aside from the path of Christian virtue which they had begun to walk in, and following Satan who had beguiled them into the path of vice and folly. But the words are capable of another meaning, equally arising kern the preceding verse, viz. that some have already followed the example of Satan, "the accuser of the brethren," and have begun to revile Christianity, taking occasion from the conduct of some who were called Christians. These revilers might be not unbelieving Jews or heathen, but apostate or heretical Jews like those of whom the same verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is used in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>.

It seems that they did not necessarily teach and preach, but those who did so, laboring in the Word and teaching, were especially worthy of honor. <span class="cmt_word">Double honor</span> (see note on ver. 3) means simply increased honor, not exactly twice as much as some one else, or with arithmetical exactness. So the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="../../par/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>; and by the LXX. in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>; and elsewhere also in classical Greek. And so we say, "twice as good," "twice as much," with the same indefinite meaning. <span class="cmt_word">The Word and teaching.</span> The "Word" means generally "the Word of God," as we have "preach the Word," "hear the Word," "the ministry of the Word," "doers of the Word," etc. And although there is no article before <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> here yet, considering the presence of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, and St. Paul's less careful use of the article in his later Epistles, this absence is not sufficient to counterbalance the weight of those considerations which lead to the conclusion that "laboring in the Word" refers to the Word of God.

But in <a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> the words are identical with those here used, even to the omission (in the R.T.) of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The conclusion is inevitable that the writer of this Epistle was acquainted with and quoted from St. Luke's Gospel; and further, that he deemed it, or at least the saying of the Lord Jesus recorded, in it, to be of equal authority with "<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>," the Scripture. If this Epistle was written by St. Paul after his first imprisonment at Rome, we may feel tolerably certain that he was acquainted with the Gospel or St. Luke, so that there is no improbability in his quoting from it. His reference to another saying of the Lord Jesus in <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a> gives additional probability to it. The passage in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> seems also to be a direct reference to the Lord's Prayer, as contained in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. St. Paul does not directly call the words <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, only treats them as of equal authority, which, if they were the words of Christ, of course they were.

He was not to encourage <span class="accented">delatores</span>, secret accusers and defamers, but if any one had a charge to make against a ruler, it was to be done <span class="accented">in the presence</span> of witnesses (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with a genitive). A doubt arises whether" the witnesses" here spoken of were to be witnesses able to support the accusation, or merely witnesses in whose presence the accusation must be made. The juxtaposition of the legal terms <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> favors the strict meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, witnesses able to support the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. And, therefore, the direction to Timothy is, "Suffer no man to accuse a presbyter unless he is accompanied by two or three witnesses who are ready to back up the accusation." The italic <span class="accented">the mouth of</span>, in the R.V., is not necessary or indeed justified.

Possibly the mention of Satan in ver. 15, or some of the rising Gnostic opinions about angels (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), may have suggested the epithet. The reason for the unusual addition of "the angels" is more difficult to adduce with certainty. But perhaps <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a> gives us the clue, where the apostle shows that in appealing to Jesus Christ he has a special eye to the great and final judgment. Now, in the descriptions of the lust judgment, the angels are constantly spoken of as accompanying our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8.htm">Mark 8</a>:48; <a href="../../par/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, etc.). If St. Paul, therefore, had in his mind the great judgment-day when he thus invoked the names of God and of Christ, he would very naturally also make mention of the elect angels. And so Bishop Bull, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' <span class="cmt_word">Without prejudice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. or classical Greek, though the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in both. Although the English word "prejudice" seems at first sight an apt rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, it does not really give the sense so accurately as "preference." We commonly mean by "prejudice" a judgment formed prior to examination, which prevents our judging rightly or fairly when we come to the examination, which, however, is not the meaning of the Latin <span class="accented">praejudicium</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> means rather "to prefer" a person, or thing, to others. And therefore <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> means "preference," or "partiality," or, as the A.V. has it, "preferring one before another." The two meanings may be thus expressed. "Prejudice," in the English use of the word, is when a person who has to judge a cause upon evidence prejudges it without evidence, and so does not give its proper weight to the evidence. "Prefer-once" is when he gives different measure to different persons, according as He is swayed by partiality, or interest, or favor. St. Paul charges Timothy to measure out exactly equal justice to all persons alike. <span class="cmt_word">By partiality</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). This also is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as far as the New Testament is concerned, and is not found in the LXX., but is found, as well as the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, in classical Greek. It means literally the "inclination" of the scales to one side or the other, and hence a "bias" of the mind to one party or the other. The balance of justice in the hands of Timothy was to be equal. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">Hastily</span> for <span class="accented">suddenly</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Lay hands</span>, etc. Surely if we are guided by St. Paul's own use of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, in the only two places in his writings where it occurs (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>), we must abide by the ancient interpretation of these words, that they mean the laying on of hands in ordination. So also in <a href="../../par/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a> and Acts 13:3, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is "to ordain." And the context here requires the same sense. The solemn injunction in the <span class="accented">pre</span>ceding verse, to deal impartially in judging even the most influential eider, naturally suggests the caution not to be hasty in ordaining any one to be an elder. Great care and previous inquiry were necessary before admitting any man, whatever might be his pretensions or position, to a holy office. A bishop who, on the spur of the moment, with improper haste, should ordain cue who afterwards required reproof as <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, sinning (ver. 20), would have a partnership in the man's sin, and in the evil consequences that flowed from it. And then it follows, <span class="cmt_word">Keep thyself pure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> clear and guiltless (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>), which he would not be if he was involved in the sin of the guilty elder. Observe that the stress is upon "thyself."

It is found in some codices of the LXX. in <a href="../../par/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12</a>, and also in classical Greek. We learn from hence the interesting fact that Timothy was, in modern parlance, a total abstainer; and we also learn that, in St. Paul's judgment, total abstinence was not to be adhered to if injurious to the health. The epithet, "a little," should not be overlooked. Was Luke, the beloved physician, with St. Paul when he wrote this prescription (see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>)? It is also interesting to have this passing allusion to Timothy's bad health, and this instance of St. Paul's thoughtful consideration for him. <span class="cmt_word">Infirmities</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); in the sense of <span class="accented">sicknesses</span>, attacks of illness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-24.htm">1 Timothy 5:24</a></div><div class="verse">Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some <i>men</i> they follow after.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Evident</span> for <span class="accented">open beforehand</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">men also</span> for <span class="accented">men</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Some men's sins</span>, etc. St. Paul is evidently here recurring to the topic which he had been dealing with ever since ver. 17, viz. Timothy's duty as a bishop, to whom was entrusted the selection of persons for the office of elder, or presbyter, and also the maintaining of discipline among his clergy. Alford sees the connection of the precept about drinking a little wine with what went before, and with this twenty-fourth verse, in the supposed circumstance that Timothy's weak health had somewhat weakened the vigor of his rule; and that the recommendation to leave off water-drinking was given more with a view to the firmer discharge of those duties than merely for his bodily comfort. This may be so. But there is nothing unlike St. Paul's manner in the supposition that he had done with the subject in hand at the end of the twenty-second verse, and passed on to the friendly hint with regard to Timothy's health, but then subjoined the fresh remarks in vers. 24 and 25, which were an afterthought. <span class="cmt_word">Evident</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only found in the New Testament, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a> besides these two verses, and in the apocryphal books of the Old Testament. It is common, with the kindred forms, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in classical Greek. It is doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in this compound verb has the force of "beforehand," as in the A.V., and not rather that of "before the eyes of all," and therefore only intensifies the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>. But the natural force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in composition certainly is "before" in point of time; and hence in a compound like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> would mean" evident before it is examined," which of course is equivalent to "very evident." St. Paul's meaning, therefore, would be: Some men's sins are notorious, requiring no careful inquisition in order to find them out; nay, they of themselves go before - before the sinner himself - unto judgment. But there are also some whose sins follow after them. It is not till after close inquiry that they are found out. They go up to the judgment-seat apparently innocent, but after a while their sins come trooping up to their condemnation. This enforces the caution, "Lay hands hastily on no man."

But now he adds a caution with regard to the Christian slave of a Christian master. There was a danger lest the feeling that slaves and masters are brothers in Christ should unduly interfere with the respect which he owed him as his master. And so St. Paul addresses a word of special advice to such. <span class="cmt_word">Let them not despise them.</span> Let not their spiritual equality with their masters lead them to underrate the worldly difference that separates them; or to think slightly of the authority of a master relatively to his slaves (comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved.</span> There is a good deal of obscurity in this sentence, but it may be observed first that the grammatical rendering of the R.V. is clearly right, and that of the A.V. clearly wrong. "They that partake of the benefit" is beyond all doubt the subject, and not the predicate. Then the construction of the two sentences (this and the preceding one) makes it certain that the subject in this sentence (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are the same persons as the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the preceding sentence, because it is predicated of them both that they are <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, and of both that they are, in convertible terms, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. And this leads us, with nearly certainty, to the further conclusion that the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the <span class="accented">beneficium</span>, or "benefit," spoken of is that especial <span class="accented">service</span> - that service of love and good will running ahead of necessary duty, which the Christian slave gives to the Christian master; a sense which the very remarkable passage quoted by Alford from Seneca strikingly confirms. The only remaining difficulty, then, is the meaning "partake of" ascribed to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> But this is scarcely a difficulty. It is true that in the only two other passages in the New Testament where this verb occurs, and in its frequent use in the LXX., it has the sense of "helping" (<a href="../../par/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>); but there is nothing strange in this. The verb in the middle voice means to "lay hold of," You may <span class="accented">lay hold of</span> for the purpose of helping, supporting, clinging to, laying claim to, holding in check, etc. (see Liddell and Scott). Here the masters <span class="accented">lay hold</span> of the benefit for the purpose of enjoying it. There is possibly an indication in the word that the masters actively and willingly accept it - they stretch out their hand to take it.

The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;</span> in Polybius means "provocation," "collision," "friction," and the like.

The difference between the A.V. "destitute" and the R.V.

For he wants nothing in this world but what God has given him, and has acquired riches which, unlike the riches of this world, he can take away with him (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>). The enumeration of his acquired treasures follows, after a parenthetical depreciation of those of the covetous man, in ver. 11.

But it seems to be as follows: "<span class="accented">But</span> godliness is, in one sense, a source of great gain, and moreover brings contentment with it - contentment, I <span class="accented">say</span>, for since we brought nothing into the world, and can carry nothing out, we have good reason to be content with the necessaries of life, food and raiment.

Alford also quotes a striking passage from Diog.

It has been justly remarked that the phrase is slightly inaccurate. What some reach after is not "the love of money," but the money itself. To avoid this, Hofmann (quoted by Luther) makes <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span> the antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;</span>, and the metaphor to be of a person turning out of his path to grasp a plant which turns out to he not desirable, but a root of bitterness.

But the simple verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, to "pierce through," "transfix," applied 'especially to "spitting" meat, is very common in Homer, who also applies it metaphorically exactly as St. Paul does here, to grief or pain. <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "pierced with pain" ('Il.,' 5:399).

It indicates that the money-lovers just spoken of were not and could not be "men of God," whatever they might profess; and it leads with singular strength to the opposite direction in which Timothy's aspirations should point. The treasures which he must covet as "a man of God" were "righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience meekness." For the phrase, "man of God," see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a> and <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>.

The meaning of "keep," like that of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, is <span class="accented">to guard</span>, <span class="accented">keep watch over</span>, and, by so doing, <span class="accented">to preserve</span> safe and uninjured. This meaning is well brought out in the familiar words of <a href="../../par/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121</a>, "He that keepeth thee will not slumber.... He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord himself is thy Keeper" (so too <a href="../../par/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>, etc.). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12, 14</a>, where the apostle uses it (in ver. 12) of his own soul, which he has committed to the safe and faithful keeping of the Lord Jesus Christ; but in ver. 14 in the same sense as here. "That good thing which was committed unto thee guard ['keep,' A.V.]." There does not seem to be any difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, which both mean "a deposit," and are used indifferently in classical Greek, though the latter is the more common. The precept to Timothy here is to keep diligent and watchful guard over the faith committed to his trust; to preserve it unaltered and uncorrupt, so as to hand it down to his successors exactly the same as he had received it. Oh that the successors of the apostles had always kept this precept (see Ordination of Priests)! <span class="cmt_word">Turning away from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the middle voice, "turning from," "avoiding," with a transitive sense. In the passive voice it means "to turn out of the path," as in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-15.htm">1 Timothy 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The profane babblings</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; only here and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>, "the utterance of empty words," "words of the lips" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Oppositions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament. It is a term used in logic and in rhetoric by Plato, Aristotle, etc., for "oppositions" and "antitheses," laying one doctrine by the side of another for comparison, or contrast, or refutation. It seems to allude to the particular method used by the heretics to establish their tenets, in opposition to the statements of the Church on particular points - such as the Law, the Resurrection, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge which is falsely so called.</span> There is a very similar intimation of the growth of an empty philosophy, whose teaching was antagonistic to the teaching of Christ in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, and with which St. Paul contrasts the true <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 3. This was clearly the germ (called by Bishop Lightfoot "Gnostic Judaism") of what was later more fully developed as the <span class="accented">Gnostic</span> heresy, which, of course, derived its name from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, knowledge or science, to which they laid claim (see Bishop Lightfoot's able 'Introduction to the Epistle to Colossians,' specially p. 100; and his notes on <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.).
