Most of the seventy wore probably his grandsons (see ver. 3); some may have been great-grandsons. They lived in Samaria; since Samaria was the principal residence of the court, Jezreel being simply a country palace - the "Versailles," as it has been called, or "Windsor" of the Israelite kings. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel.</span> "Jezreel" is almost certainly a corrupt reading. The "rulers of Jezreel" would be at Jezreel; and, if Jehu wished to communicate with them, he would not need to "write." Had any chance taken them to Samaria - a very improbable circumstance  - they would have had no authority there, and to address them would have been useless. John's letters were, no doubt, addressed <span class="accented">to the rulers of Samaria</span>; and so the LXX. expressly state (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but the reading "Jezreel" can scarcely have arisen out of "Samaria" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> out of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), since the difference of the two words is so great. Most probably the original word was "Israel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>), which is easily corrupted into "Jezreel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>).

There is no public post. Kings and private individuals must equally find persons who will undertake to carry and deliver their despatches. Even the post organized by Darius Hystaspis was not one that went daily, but only one kept ready for the king to use when he had occasion for it. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing your master's sons are with you.</span> "Your master's sons" must mean Joram's sons; by which we learn that, unlike his brother Ahaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>), Joram had male offspring who survived him, and were now with the rest of Ahab's descendants, at Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the chariots</span>, <span class="accented">and the horses</span>, <span class="accented">a fenced city also</span>, <span class="accented">and the armor</span>. The main chariot force of the country, and the chief arsenal, containing both armor and arms, were naturally at Samaria, the capital, and might thus be regarded as at the disposition of the Samaritan municipality. Jehu scornfully challenges them to make use of their resources against him. He is quite ready for a contest. Let them do their worst. The LXX. have "fenced cities" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) instead of "a fenced city;" but the existing Hebrew text is probably right Samaria was the only fortified town in their possession. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-3.htm">2 Kings 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set <i>him</i> on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look even out the belt and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne.</span> "Choose," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "among the sons of Joram the strongest, the boldest, and the ablest, and make him king in his father's zoom; take him for your leader against me; do not hesitate and beat about the bush; but at once make up your minds, and let me know what I have to expect." <span class="cmt_word">And fight for your master's house.</span> There had been a civil war before the dynasty of Omri succeeded in settling itself on the throne (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-21.htm">1 Kings 16:21, 22</a>). Jehu believes, or affects to believe, that there will now be another. He does not deprecate it, but invites it. Probably he felt tolerably confident that the garrison of Samaria, even if called upon by the municipality, would not venture to take up arms against the army of Ramoth-Gilead, which had declared itself in his favor. Still, supposing that it did, he was not fearful of the result. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-4.htm">2 Kings 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But they wore exceedingly afraid.</span> They were men of peace, not men of war - accustomed to discharge the duties of judges and magistrates, not of commandants and generals. They could not count on the obedience even of the troops in Samaria, much less on that of any others who might be in garrison elsewhere. They would naturally have been afraid of taking up arms under almost any circumstances. What, however, caused them now such excessive fear was probably the tone which Jehu had adopted - his "scornful challenge," as it has been called. He evidently entertained no fear himself. He dared them to do that which he pretended to recommend them to do. They must have felt that he was laughing at them in his sleeve. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</span> The kings intended are Joram and Ahaziah, who had confronted Jehu, and had met their deaths. What were they that they should succeed where "two kings" had failed? The argument was fallacious, and a mere cloak for cowardice. The two kings had been taken by surprise, and treacherously murdered. Their fate could prove nothing concerning the probable issue of a civil war, had the "princes" ventured to commence it. It must be admitted, however, that the chance of success was but slight.

The "governor" of a town was assisted by a council of elders. <span class="cmt_word">And the bringers up of the children</span> (see the comment on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do sit that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king.</span> Jehu's letter had the effect which he intended, of making the authorities of Samaria declare themselves. They might, perhaps, have temporized, have sent an ambiguous answer, or have sent no answer at all, and have let their action be guided by the course of events. But, taken aback by Jehu's directness and plainness of speech, it did not occur to them to be diplomatic; they felt driven into a corner, and compelled to make their choice at once. Either they must resist Jehu in arms or they must submit to him. If they submitted, they had best (they thought) do it with a good grace. Accordingly, his letter produced a reply, more favorable than he can possibly have expected - "They were his servants," or "his slaves," ready to do all his pleasure; they would not set up a king, or in any way dispute his succession; they submitted themselves wholly to his will. <span class="cmt_word">Do thou</span> [they said] that which is <span class="cmt_word">good in thine eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "take what steps thou pleasest to confirm thyself in the kingdom."

The reply of the Samaritan authorities gave Jehu an opportunity, of which he was not slow to take advantage. They might have been contented with their negative response, "We will not make any man king;" but they had gone beyond it - they had departed from the line of neutrality, and had placed themselves unreservedly on Jehu's side. "We are thy servants," they had said, "and will do all that thou shalt bid us." It is always rash to promise absolute obedience to a human being. To volunteer such a promise, when it is not even asked, is the height of folly. <span class="cmt_word">If ye be mine</span> - as they had said they were, when they called themselves his "slaves" - <span class="cmt_word">and if ye will hearken unto my voice</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, obey me, do as I require - <span class="cmt_word">take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel.</span> The Samaritan authorities were ordered to bring the heads with them, that they might be seen and counted. In the East generally, the heads of rebels and pretenders, by whatever death they may have died, are cut off, brought to the sovereign, and then exposed in some public place, in order that the public at large may be certified that the men are really dead (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By tomorrow this time.</span> As Jezreel was not more than about twenty miles from Samaria, the order could be executed by that time. It necessitated, however, very prompt measures, and gave the authorities but little time for consideration. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up (comp. ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-7.htm">2 Kings 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him <i>them</i> to Jezreel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons.</span> Having committed themselves by their answer to Jehu's first letter, the Samaritan great men seemed to themselves to have no choice, on receiving his second, but to allow themselves to become the tools and agents of his policy. They accordingly put the seventy princes to death without any hesitation, though they can scarcely have done so without reluctance. <span class="cmt_word">And put their heads in baskets.</span> Thus concealing their bloody deed as long as they could. In the Assyrian sculptures, those who slay the king's enemies carry the heads openly in their hands, as though glorying in what they have done. <span class="cmt_word">And sent him them to Jezreel.</span> Jehu had bidden them to bring the heads to him; but this was a degradation to which they did not feel bound to submit.

"The gate" was also a general place of assembly for the gossips of the town and others, who would soon spread the news, and bring together a crowd of persons, curious to see so unusual a sight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-9.htm">2 Kings 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye <i>be</i> righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous.</span> Not an ironical reproach to those who had brought the heads - "Ye consider yourselves righteous, yet this bloodshed rests upon you;" much less a serious declaration (Gerlach) that now at last the sins of idolatrous Israel were atoned for; but an argument ad captandum, addressed to the crowd of spectators whom the unwonted spectacle had brought together, "Ye are just persons, and capable of pronouncing a just judgment; judge, then, if I am the wicked person which men generally consider me." <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</span> I confess to one murder; but here are seventy murders. And who is guilty of them? Not I, or my party, but the trusted adherents of the Ahabite dynasty, the rulers placed by them over the capital, and the governors to whom they had entrusted the royal children. Does not this show that all parties are weary of the Ahabites and of their system? Does it not clear me of any private or selfish motive, and indicate the desire of the whole nation for a change, civil and religions - a change which shall entirely subvert the new religion introduced by Jezebel, and fall back upon the lines of that maintained by Elijah and Elisha?

The whole house of Ahab would perish - it would be made like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>), and its adherents would share its fate. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "has requited Ahab in the portion of Jezreel; has caused dogs to eat the flesh of Jezebel; and has begun the destruction of his house.

Encouraged by his past success, having killed Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Jezebel, having secured the adhesion of the chief men in Samaria, and effected the destruction of all those who might naturally have claimed the succession and involved him in civil war, Jehu proceeded to greater lengths. He "slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel" - the princesses probably, as well as the princes - and further put to death all the leading partisans of the dethroned dynasty, the "great men," perhaps even those who had worked his bloody will at Samaria, and the intimate friends and supporters of the house - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, as they are here called - not relatives, but "intimate acquaintances." <span class="cmt_word">And his priests.</span> This expression causes a difficulty, since the destruction of the Baal-priests is related subsequently (vers. 19-25).

But this signification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is scarcely an ascertained one.

Jehonadab is mentioned only here and in the passage of Jeremiah just quoted; but it is evident that he was an important personage. His tribe, the Kenites, was probably of Arab origin, and certainly of Arab habits. It attached itself to the Israelites during their wanderings in the Sinaitic desert, and was given a settlement in "the wilderness of Judah," on the conquest of Palestine (<a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>). Jehonadab seems to have been of an ascetic turn, and to have laid down for his tribe a rule of life stricter and more severe than any known previously. He required them not merely to dwell in tents, and, unless under the compulsion of war, never to enter cities, but also to abstain wholly from the use of wine, and to have neither house, nor field, nor vineyard (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Jeremiah 35:8-10</a>). Gautama, between three and four centuries later, enjoined a somewhat similar rule upon his disciples. It is indicative of much strength of character in either case, that so strict a rule was accepted, adopted, and acted upon for centuries. On the present occasion, Jehu, it would seem, desired the sanction of Jehonadab to the proceedings upon which he was about to enter, as calculated to legitimate them in the eyes of some who might otherwise have regarded them with disapproval. Jehonadab had, no doubt, the influence which is always wielded by an ascetic in Oriental countries. <span class="cmt_word">Coming to meet him.</span> This expression tells us nothing of Jehonadab's intent. The meeting may have been merely a chance one. <span class="cmt_word">And he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</span> literally, <span class="accented">he blessed him</span>; but the word used (<span class="accented">barak</span>) has frequently the sense of "to salute" (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-10.htm">1 Samuel 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>, etc.). Jehu's inquiry was made to assure himself of Jehonadab's sympathy, on which no doubt he counted, but whereof he was glad to receive a positive promise. Jehonadab must have been known as a zealous servant of Jehovah, and might therefore be assumed to be hostile to the house of Ahab. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehonadab answered, It is.</span> Unhesitatingly, without a moment's pause, without the shadow of a doubt, the Kenite chief cast in his lot with the revolutionist. Heart and soul he would join him in an anti-Ahab policy. <span class="cmt_word">If it he, Give me thine hand.</span> The Hebrews did not clench agreements, like the Greeks and Romans, by grasping each other's hands. Jehu merely means to say, "If this is so, if thou art heart and. soul with me in the matter, put out thy hand, and I will take thee into my chariot." Jehu intended at once to do honor to the Kenite chief, and to strengthen his own position by being seen to be so familiar with him. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehonadab - <span class="cmt_word">gave him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehu - <span class="cmt_word">his hand</span>; <span class="cmt_word">and he took him up to him into the chariot.</span> There was always room in a chariot for at least three or four persons - the charioteer and the owner of the chariot in front, and one or two guards behind.

Probably, as yet, no suspicion had touched the public mind that Jehu would be a less zealous worshipper of Baal than his predecessor. The outburst against Jezebel's "whoredoms" and "witchcrafts" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>) would be known to few, and might not have been understood as a condemnation of the entire Baalistic system. The "zeal for Jehovah" whispered in the ear of Jehonadab (ver. 16) had been hitherto kept secret. Thus there was nothing to prevent the multitude from giving implicit credence to the proclamation now made, and looking to see the new reign inaugurated by a magnificent and prolonged festival in honor of the two great Phoenician deities, Baal the sun-god, and Ashtoreth or Astarte the famous "Dea Syra" Such festivals were frequently held in Phoenicia and the rest of Syria, often lasting over many days, and constituting a time of excitement, feasting, and profligate enjoyment, which possessed immense attraction for the great mass of Asiatics.

The Egyptians called the priest <span class="accented">ab</span>, the prophet <span class="accented">neter hen</span>, literally, "servant of <span class="accented">God</span>." They held the priest in the greater honor. In Phoenicia, on the contrary, judging from the scanty notices that we possess, prophets appear to have taken precedence of priests, and to have had the more important functions assigned to them (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let none be wanting</span> - literally, <span class="accented">let not a man fail - <span class="cmt_word"></span>for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal.</span> Like the other gods of the heathen, Baal and Ashtoreth were worshipped chiefly by sacrifice.

In the greater festivals several hundreds of victims were offered; and their flesh was served up at the banquets by which the festivals were accompanied. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.</span> His absence would be regarded as an act of contumacy verging on rebellion, and so as deserving of capital punishment. <span class="cmt_word">But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</span> "Subtilty" was characteristic of John, who always preferred to gain his ends by cunning rather than in a straightforward way. Idolaters were by the Law liable to death, and Jehu would have had a perfect right to crush the Baal-worship throughout the land, by sending his emissaries everywhere, with orders to slay all whom they found engaged in it. But to draw some thousands of his subjects by false pretences into a trap, and then to kill them in it for doing what he had himself invited them to do, was an act that was wholly unjustifiable, and that savored, not of the wisdom which is from above, but of that bastard wisdom which is "earthly, sensual, devilish" (<a href="../../par/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>). Jehu's religious reformation did not succeed, and it was conducted in such a way that it did not deserve to succeed. A little more honest boldness, and a little less frequent resort to subterfuge and craft, might have had a different result, and have been better both for himself and for his people.

That he should have thought such a thing possible or even probable indicates the general laxity of the time, and the want of any sharp line of demarcation between the adherents of the two religions. He cleverly masked his desire for the safety of his own religionists under a show of keen anxiety that the coming ceremonies should not be profaned by the presence of scoffers or indifferent persons.

With whatever intent the worship had been set up by its author, the curse of God had been pronounced against it by the chief prophet of the time (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), and his word had been attired as from heaven by two miracles (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4, 5</a>). Jehu ought to have known that the calf-worship, if not as hateful to God as the Baal-worship, at any rate was hateful, was a standing act of rebellion against Jehovah, and laid the nation under his displeasure. But, while his own interests were entirely detached from the one, they were, or at least would seem to him to be, bound up with the other. The calf-worship was thought to be essential to the matureance of the divided kingdom. Abolish it, and all Israel would "return to the house of David" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-30</a>). Jehu was not prepared to risk this result. His "zeal for Jehovah" did not reach so far. Thus his "reformation of religion" was but a half-reformation, a partial turning to Jehovah, which brought no permanent blessing upon the nation. To wit, <span class="cmt_word">the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</span> The erection of the calves (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>) was the initial sin, their worship the persistent one.

He is exactly one of those men whom we are compelled to recognize, not for what is good or great in themselves, but as instruments for destroying evil, and preparing the way for good; such as Augustus Caesar at Rome, Sultan Mahmoud II. in Turkey, or one closer at hand in the revolutions of our own time and neighborhood. A destiny, long kept in view by himself or ethers - inscrutable secrecy and reserve in carrying out his plans - a union of cold, remorseless tenacity with occasional bursts of furious, wayward, almost fanatical zeal;  - this is Jehu, as he is set before us in the historical narrative, the worst type of a son of Jacob - the 'supplanter'...without the noble and princely qualities of Israel; the most unlovely and the most coldly commended of all the heroes of his country" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 289). The estimate is lower than that formed by most other writers; but it is not far from the truth. <span class="cmt_word">For he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. ver. 29).

The "theocracy" under the kings was carried on mainly, as the writer of Chronicles clearly saw, by the bestowal of worldly prosperity and military success on good kings, and the accumulation of misfortunes and military disasters on bad ones (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2-15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2-15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-5</a>. etc.). By "cutting Israel short" - literally, "cutting off in Israel" - is probably meant the conquest of certain portions of the territory. Hazael resumed the war which Benhadad had so long waged, and gained numerous successes. <span class="cmt_word">And Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel</span>; or, <span class="accented">along their whole frontier</span> (Bahr).

We find him, on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II., mentioned as a stubborn adversary of the Assyrian arms. In the seventeenth campaign of Shalmaneser, a great battle was fought between the two monarchs. Hazael brought into the field more than twelve hundred chariots, but was defeated, and obliged to retreat, his camp falling into the hands of the enemy ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 84). Four years later Shalmaneser invaded Hazael's territory, and took, according to his own account (ibid., p. 35), four cities or fortresses belonging to him. He does not claim, however, to have made him a tributary; and By his later annals it is evident that he avoided further contest, preferring to turn his arms in other directions.

She inherited much of her mother Jezebel's character, obtained an unlimited ascendancy over her husband, Jehoram, and kept her son Ahaziah in leading-strings. It was unquestionably through her influence that Jehoram was prevailed upon to introduce the Baal-worship into Judah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-5.htm">2 Chronicles 2:5, 11</a>), and Ahaziah prevailed upon to maintain it (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-27.htm">2 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3</a>, "He also Talked in the ways of the house of Ahab: <span class="accented">for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly"</span>). On the death of Ahaziah, she found her position seriously imperiled. The crown would have passed naturally to one of her grandchildren, the eldest of the sons of Ahaziah. She would have lost her position of <span class="accented">gebirah</span>, or queen mother, which would have passed to the widow of Ahaziah, the mother of the new sovereign. If she did not at once lose all influence, at any rate a counter-influence to hers would have been established; and this might well have been that of the high priest, who was closely connected by marriage with the royal family. Under these circumstances, she took the bold resolution described in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">She arose and destroyed the seed royal.</span> She issued her orders, and had all the members of the house of David on whom she could lay her hands put to death. The royal house had already been greatly depleted by Jehoram's murder of his brothers (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>), by Arab marauders (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>), and by Jehu's murder of the "brethren of Ahaziah" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-14.htm">2 Kings 10:14</a>); but it is clear that Ahaziah had left several sons behind him, and some of his "brethren" had also, in all probability, left issue. There may also have been many other descendants of David in Judah, belonging to other branches of the house than that of Rehoboam.

We must suppose that, after a few days' concealment in the "chamber of mattresses," Jehosheba found an opportunity of transferring him, with his nurse, to a chamber in the temple, where he was thenceforward nourished and brought up.

It cannot mean less than that for six years Baalism was triumphant in Judah  - the temple was allowed to fall into decay (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>) - a temple to Baal was erected in Jerusalem itself, to supersede the temple of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), and a high priest appointed to be a rival to the successor of Aaron. Whether persecution was indulged in, as under Jehoram (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>), is uncertain; but the servants of Jehovah were at any rate under a cloud, slighted, contemned, held as of small account. Perhaps we may conclude, from the position occupied by Jehoiada, and from the powers which he was able to exercise when he determined on revolt (ver. 4; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1, 2</a>), that Athaliah, during her six years' reign, was to some extent held in check by a Jehovistic party, which she knew to exist, and which she did not dare openly to defy. Thus she left Jehoiada (apparently) in possession of the temple, of its treasures and its armory (ver. 10); she allowed the temple service to continue (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>); she permitted the priests and the Levites to serve in their regular "courses" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>); she let the fortress of the eastern city - for the temple was always a fortress  - remain in her enemies' hands. Still, the time was evidently one "of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy" the oppressed worshippers of Jehovah were greatly discontented; and the nation generally was ripe for a counter-revolution, so soon as the signal was given by an authority whom they could trust. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Conspiracy of Jehoiada</span>. After waiting, impatiently we may be sure, for six long years, and seeing the young prince grow from an infant to a boy of seven years of age, Jehoiada deemed that the time was come to venture on an effort. It was necessary for him to make his arrangements beforehand with great care. His first step was to sound the captains of the royal guard. To these men, five in number (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), he sent secretly, and in-wired them to confer with him in the temple on important business. Finding them well disposed to adopt his views, he revealed to them the fact that Joash had escaped the massacre of Ahaziah's sons, and was still living, even allowing them to see him. The result of the interview was that they put themselves at Jehoiada's disposal, and agreed to take their orders from him (ver. 4). Jehoiada then proceeded to his second step. Either distrusting the body-guard which the captains commanded, or regarding it as insufficient in numbers, he gave them orders to visit the various cities of Judea, and collect from them a strong force of Levites and other trusty persons, and bring them to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), where he would give them their orders. This was done successfully, and, as it would seem, without in any way rousing the suspicions of Athaliah. A day was fixed for proclaiming Joash king; the guard and the Levites were skillfully disposed about the temple and the palace; the king was brought up, crowned, anointed, and saluted as monarch, with noisy acclamations (ver. 12). The noise was heard in the palace, and Athaliah went forth, with a few attendants, to inquire the reason of it. Following the sound, she came to the temple, and entered it, when she saw what was going on, and cried out, "Treason! Treason!" By Jehoiada's order the guards seized her, conducted her out of the temple, and slew her (vers. 13-16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh year</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and in the seventh year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the course of it  - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds,</span> <span class="cmt_word">with the captains and the guard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the captains over hundreds</span> (or, centurions) <span class="accented">of the Carites and the guard</span> (see the Revised Version). The "Carites," here first named, are generally regarded as identical with the Cherethites of earlier times (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>). They were undoubtedly a particular portion of the royal guard, and may, perhaps, as many suppose, have been "Caftan" mercenaries, though we have no other evidence that the Carians had adopted the mercenary life so early as the time of Athaliah. Still, as their devotion to it had passed into a proverb when Archilochus wrote (B.C. 700-660), it is quite possible that they had begun the practice a century or two earlier. When Jehoiada is said to have "sent and fetched" the centurions, we must understand that he secretly invited them, and that they consented to come. He could not possibly have any authority over them, so as to require their attendance. The names of the five centurions, together with their fathers' names, were put on record by the writer of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), whose account of the revolution is in many respects fuller than that in Kings. <span class="cmt_word">And brought them to him into the house of the Lord</span> - as the safest place for an interview which had to be kept secret from the queen - <span class="cmt_word">and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the Lord.</span> We can easily understand that the soldiers, who had been willing to serve Athaliah under the notion that the house of David was extinct, might waver in their allegiance so soon as they heard that a scion of the old royal stock survived, and could be produced at a moment's notice. Their traditions would attach them to David and his seed, not to the house of Ahab. <span class="cmt_word">And showed them the king's son.</span> Having bound the centurions by a solemn covenant to the cause of the young king, Jehoiada introduced them into his presence. He had, no doubt, previously sworn them to secrecy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he commanded them, saying, This <i>is</i> the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do.</span> It is evident, from 2 Chronicles and from Josephus, that a considerable interval of time separates the events of ver. 5 from those of ver. 4. The <span class="accented">immediate</span> arrangement made between Jehoiada and the centurions was that they should "go throughout the whole land" (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 2), visit "all the cities of Judah" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), and gather out of them a strong force of Levites and priests (Josephus), together with a certain number of other representative Israelites, which force they should bring with them to Jerusalem, and place at his disposal. To accomplish this must have taken some weeks. When the force had arrived, Jehoiada summoned it to meet him in the courts of the temple, and swore it to a similar covenant to that which he had made with the centurions. He then bided his time, completed his arrangements, utilized the store of arms laid up in the temple armory (ver. 10), and finally gave two charges - one to the centurions, which is given here (vers. 5-8), and the other to the force collected from the cities of Judah, which is given in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>). The orders given to the two forces were very similar, but not identical. <span class="cmt_word">A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath.</span> The royal body-guard consisted of five divisions, each probably of a hundred men, and each commanded by its own captain (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>). It was usual on the sabbath for three divisions out of the five to mount guard at the royal palace, while two were engaged outside, keeping order in the city, and especially at the temple. We do not know the ordinary disposition of the guard, either inside or outside the palace. On this occasion Jehoiada commanded that the palace-guard should be disposed as follows: one division at the palace proper, in the courts and halls and antechambers; a second at one of the issues from the palace, known as "the gate of Sur;" and a third at an issue called "the gate of the guard," which was certainly towards the east, where the palace fronted the temple. The object was to secure the palace, but not to prevent the queen from leaving it. <span class="cmt_word">Shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the royal palace.

We must understand one of the <span class="accented">palace</span> gates, but which of them is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">And a third part at the gate behind the guard</span>; called in ver. 19 "the gate of the <span class="accented">guard</span>," and shown there to have been on the <span class="accented">cast</span> side of the palace, where it faced the temple, and abutted on the Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">So shall ye keep the watch of the house</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the "king's house," or palace, which is contrasted with the "house of the Lord" of the next verse - <span class="cmt_word">that it be not broken down.</span> This rendering is scarcely accepted at the present time by any writers. Ewald renders, "according to custom;" Keil, "for defense;" Furst, "alternately;" our Revisers, "and be a barrier."

The order was that if any one entered the temple, and attempted to break through the ranks of the guard, either in front of the king or behind him, he should instantly be put to death.

The Chronicler, writing much later, gives Jehoiada the title on the first occasion that he mentions him (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>). When it is said that "<span class="accented">all</span> the captains took their men and came to Jehoiada," the intention is to mark their exact obedience to the orders given them. Strictly speaking, only two out of the five actually appeared before Jehoiada on the day of the execution of his project, two divisions only having been summoned to come to the temple (ver. 7). The other three took up the positions assigned them in and about the royal palace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that <i>were</i> in the temple of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give King David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the Lord.</span> We hear of David carrying with him to Jerusalem the "shields of gold," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shields ornamented with gold, which he took from the servants of Hadadezer (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>); but otherwise we are not told of his establishing an armory. Solomon made six hundred shields of solid gold, and laid them up in the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>); but these were carried off by Sheshonk, when he invaded Judaea in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>). Rehoboam, in their place, made three hundred brazen shields (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>), which, however, were deposited in the guard-chamber of the royal palace. Of spears collected by David, and laid up in the temple, we know nothing beyond the present passage. There can be little doubt that the weapons were brought forth from their receptacle with the view (as Ewald says) of "consecrating the work of the restoration of the Davidic house with the sacred arms of the great founder himself" (see 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136) - not, however, with arms that he had worn, but with some which he had collected and laid up.

No one, it must be remembered, was ever allowed to enter inside the sanctuary but the priests and officiating Levites (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>). And the temple. "The temple" is here the sanctuary, as in the passage of Chronicles just quoted.

The gate intended can scarcely be the "horse gate" of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a>, which was in the eastern wall, and north of the temple.

And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in." During Athaliah's reign the temple service had ceased; breaches had been broken in the outer walls; and neither the priests nor the porters had served in their regular order; there had been no morning or evening sacrifice, and no antiphonal psalm-singing.

It is rather surprising that the temple had not been thoroughly repaired by Jehoiada during the long minority of Joash, when he must practically have had the sole management of affairs. Probably he did repair the worst of the damage done by Athaliah's orders (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>), which may have been very considerable, but neglected the restoration of such portions of the edifice as appeared to him of secondary importance, as the walls of the courts and the outbuildings. Joash, however, when his minority came to an end, and he succeeded to the administration of the state, took a different view. To him the completion of the repairs seemed a pressing business. Probably he thought the honor of God required the entire obliteration of Athaliah's wicked proceedings, and the renewal of the temple's old glories. His six years' residence within the temple precincts may have also inspired him with a love of the building as a building. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash said to the priests.</span> The initiative of Joash is strongly marked, alike in Kings and Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4</a>). The general weakness of his character, and want of vigor and decision, make it the more surprising that he should in this particular matter have shown himself capable of taking his own line and adhering to it (ver. 7). He has scarcely received from historians the credit that is due to him for his persistent and successful efforts to accomplish an object which was for the honor of religion, and which was yet not pressed forward by the priesthood. Certainly he was no mere puppet of the priestly order. <span class="cmt_word">All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the money of the holy gifts that is brought into the house of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all that ye receive from the people in the way of money.

Secondly, the <span class="cmt_word">money that every man is set at</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the redemption money, derived in part from the payments made for redeeming the firstborn (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15, 16</a>); in part from the sums which the priests exacted from such as had vowed themselves (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2-8</a>), or those belonging to them, to God. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> [thirdly] <span class="cmt_word">all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the free-will offerings that should be made in money by any of the Israelites.

The priests of each locality were to be the collectors, and would therefore gather "of their acquaintance." As we cannot suppose that very much would accrue from either the first or second source, since a census was rarely taken, and personal vows were not very common, we must regard the command of Joash as, in the main, the authorization of a general collection throughout the kingdom of voluntary contributions towards the temple repairs, and so as analogous to the "letters" which our own sovereigns, or archbishops, issue from time to time for collections in churches for special objects. <span class="cmt_word">And let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.</span> The "breaches," or dilapidations, may have been caused, partly by the neglect of necessary repairs during the reigns of Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Athaliah; but they were mainly the result of the willful violence of Athaliah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>).

They had simply been negligent. Probably very little money had come in; and they had not been very active in their endeavors to obtain larger contributions. It must be remembered that what went to the fabric fund would, for the most part, be a deduction from the ordinary revenue of the temple, which was not, perhaps, much in excess of the ordinary demands upon it. We can, therefore, quite understand that the king's policy would not be popular with the priests (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>).

It was then delivered over to "the overseers of the house" - persons, probably, of the priestly order - appointed by Jehoiada (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), who disbursed it to the carpenters and masons (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-11.htm">2 Kings 12:11, 12</a>). The chest was a sort of tangible evidence to the people of the purpose to which their contributions would be applied, and naturally stimulated their giving. The presence of the king's officer at the counting of the money, was equivalent, not really to an "audit" (Stanley), but to a publication of the accounts, and would prevent any suspension of the work, so long as it was clear that the money found in the chest had not been expended. Thus a new impetus was given to the movement. The measures taken completely answered. Contributions flowed in rapidly, and in a few years the whole work was accomplished (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?</span> This shows that no repairs were going on 'in the twenty-third year of Joash, but not that none had been done previously. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore receive no more money of your acceptance.</span> This was a revocation of the order given in ver. 5, and necessarily put an end to the local collections, which that order required.

In point of fact, they were to "receive" (ver. 9), but in a new way.

The bags, when weighed, were handed over by the high priest and the royal secretary to the officers whom Jehoiada had appointed (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>) to have the general superintendence of the "house." <span class="cmt_word">And they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the Lord.</span> The "paid it out" of our Revisers is better than "laid it out."

A considerable gap occurs between vers. 16 and 17. We learn from Chronicles some particulars of the interval. Not long after the completion of the repairs, Jehoiada, who had lived to a good old age in complete harmony with the monarch, expired. His piety, and his good services, as preserver of the house of David, as restorer of the temple-worship, and joint-repairer with Joash of the temple itself, were regarded as entitling him to extraordinary funeral honors; and by general consent he was interred within the city of Jerusalem, in the sepulchers of the kings (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-16.htm">2 Chronicles 24:16</a>). His removal led to a fresh religious revolution. "The Jewish aristocracy, who perhaps had never been free from the licentious and idolatrous taint introduced by Rehoboam and confirmed by Athaliah, and who may well have been galled by the new rise of the priestly order, presented themselves before Joash, and offered him the same obsequious homage that bad been paid by the young nobles to Rehoboam. He... feeling himself released from personal obligations by the death of his adopted father, threw himself into their hands. Athaliah was avenged almost upon the spot where she had been first seized by her enemies" (Stanley, 'Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 345). Joash began by allowing the reintroduction of idolatry and grove-worship (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-18.htm">2 Chronicles 24:18</a>), and then, when remonstrated with by Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, who had succeeded his father in the office of high priest, had the remonstrant set upon by the people and slain. The writer of Chronicles closely connects this murderous deed with the Syrian war, which followed it within a year (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>), and was generally regarded as a Divine judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Hazael King of Syria went up, and fought against Gath.</span> Hitherto Judah had been safe from any attack on the part of Syria, since Israel had been interposed between the two powers. Now, however, that Hazael had conquered from Jehu the entire trans-Jordanic territory (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>), the case was wholly altered - Judah and Syria had become conterminous along the line of the lower Jordan, and Syria could invade Judaea at any moment. It is surprising that Gath should have been the special object of attack, since Oath (<span class="accented">Abu-Gheith</span>) lay remote from the Syrian frontier, in the southwestern part of Judaea, and could only be reached from Syria by an enemy who was not afraid of leaving Jerusalem behind him. Gath, when last mentioned, was a Judaean city, and was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>); but it was originally Philistine (1 Samuel 5:17), and the Philistines had recovered it before the time of Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). To which power it belonged when Hazael made war upon it is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">And took it</span> - probably took it by storm, and plundered it, but did not attempt an occupation - <span class="cmt_word">and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</span> If Gath be <span class="accented">Abu-Gheith</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> appears probable, it would be distant from Jerusalem not less than forty miles in a direct line. If Hazael, however, was returning to the trans-Jordanic country taken from Israel, it would lie in his way, and might naturally tempt him to make a dash at it, more especially as he was flushed with victory.

This gave opportunity for conspiracy. Among the courtiers were two, perhaps more, whom the fate of Zechariah had grieved, and who were probably opposed to the entire series of later changes in religion which had been sanctioned by Joash (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17, 18</a>). These persons "made a conspiracy," which was successful, and "slew Joash on his bed" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>).

The proof is given at somewhat tedious length by Keil ('Biblical Commentary,' pp. 373, 374) and Bahr ('Books of the Kings,' pp. 139, 140). It seems unnecessary to enter into a lengthy discussion of the point, since all the synchronisms of the later kings of Israel and Judah are in confusion, and appear to be the work of a later hand. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Ahaziah</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>) <span class="cmt_word">King of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">reigned over Israel</span>. The "later hand," which inserted the synchronism, neglected to bring the two portions of the verse into agreement. Our translators have sought to cover up his omission by translating <span class="accented">malak</span> "began to <span class="accented">reign</span>," and then supplying "and reigned" in the next clause.

Jehu had done the same (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>), as had all previous kings of Israel from the time of Jeroboam. The honor of God, however, required that idolatry of whatever kind should be punished, and the Samaritan kingdom could not otherwise be saved from destruction than by, "casting away <span class="accented">all</span> the works of darkness" and returning to the <span class="accented">pure</span> worship of Jehovah. Hence Jehu himself, notwithstanding the good service that he had done in crushing the Baal-worship, was chastised by God (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>) on account of his continuance in the "sin of Jeroboam;" and now Jehoahaz was even more signally punished. As Keil remarks, "The longer and the more obstinately the sin was continued, the more severe did the punishment become." <span class="cmt_word">And followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>, where the exegetical clause is added, "To wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan") <span class="cmt_word">which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-26.htm">1 Kings 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-19.htm">1 Kings 16:19, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>, etc.); he departed not therefrom. This is emphatic. Jehoahaz kept up the worship to the full, and in no way suffered it to decline.

Still, we must remember the coarse, lewd dancing which accompanied the first calf-worship (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>), for which death was not thought too heavy a penalty (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>), and the almost universal combination of unchastity with idolatrous ceremonies, which raises a suspicion that those who frequented the shrines at Dan and Bethel were not wholly innocent of impurity. <span class="cmt_word">And he delivered them into the hand of Hazel King of Syria.</span> The national sins of Israel were mostly punished in this way, by the sword of some foreign foe. Hazael had been already made an instrument for the chastisement of Jehu (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>). Now he was to chastise Jehoahaz still more severely. <span class="cmt_word">And into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all the days</span>. Not certainly all the days of the two kings Hazael and Benhadad, for Benhadad was entirely worsted in his war with Joash (vers. 24, 25), but either all the days of Jehoahaz, or all the days that God had appointed for the duration of the calamity. It is perhaps against the former interpretation that Hazael appears to have outlived Jehoahaz (vers. 22-24); but Ben-hadad may have warred against him as his father's general (ver. 25) during his father's lifetime.

Jehoahaz, as Josephus says, "betook him-serf to prayer and supplication of God, entreating that he would deliver him out of the hands of Hazael, and not suffer him to continue subject" ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 5). He did not turn from his sin of idolatry, perhaps did not suspect that it was this sin which had provoked God's anger; but in a general way he repented, humbled himself, and besought God's mercy and assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hearkened unto him.</span> God accepted his repentance, all imperfect as it was, so far as to save the people from the entire destruction with which it was threatened by the severe measures of Hazael (ver. 7), to continue the national existence (ver. 23), and ultimately to restore the national prosperity (ver. 25 and <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-27</a>). But he did not remove the oppression, as Josephus imagines, in Jehoahaz's time. Ver. 22 makes this fact absolutely certain. <span class="cmt_word">For he saw the oppression of Israel, because the King of Syria oppressed them.</span> Oppression is always hateful to God, even when he is using it as his instrument for chastising or punishing a guilty people. He "sees" it, notes it, lays it up in his remembrance for future retribution (camp. <a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>, etc.).

The special "deliverer" was probably in the mind of the writer, Jeroboam II., by whom he says, in ch. 14:27, that God "saved" Israel; but Joash, who began the deliverance (ver. 25), may also be glanced at, <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel dwelt in their tents.</span> Here, as so often elsewhere (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-12.htm">2 Kings 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-7.htm">Zechariah 12:7</a>), the word "tents" is a mere archaism for "abodes, houses."

Some think that it was "an image of Astarte" (see 'Homiletic Commentary' on 1 Kings, p. 374); but more probably it was a mere emblem, analogous to the Assyrian "sacred tree." Its material may sometimes have been wood, but was perhaps more usually metal. The mistranslation "grove" originated with the Septuagint translators, who uniformly rendered <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It is surprising that Jehu did not destroy the <span class="accented">asherah</span> together with the other idolatrous erections of Ahab in Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26-28</a>); but, for some reason or other, it seems to have been spared, and to have been still standing. So long as it stood, even if it did not attract the religious regards of any, it would be a standing dishonor to God, and would so increase the sin of the nation. Hence its mention in this passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen.</span> This verse seems to be an exegetical note on ver. 4, which perhaps it once followed immediately, the parenthetic section (vers. 5 and 6) having been added later, as an afterthought, either by the original writer, or perhaps by a later hand. The meaning seems to be that Hazael limited the standing army of Jehoahaz to fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, not that he slew the entire military population except this small remnant. The policy of limiting the forces to be maintained by a subject-king was one known to the Romans, and has often been adopted in the East. It is still a part of our own policy in the government of India. The limitation left the country at the mercy of all its neighbors (see ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">For the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</span> Possibly this means no more than an utter destruction - a trampling in the dust, as we phrase it (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12, 13</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>). But it may be an allusion to that destruction of prisoners by means of a threshing instrument, which was certainly sometimes practiced (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>), and which is made a special charge against Damascus (<a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>.

It is uncertain whether they had one common mausoleum, like the kings of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a>), but it is most probable that they had.

The writer passes from the reign of Jehoahaz, Jehu's son, to that of Joash, Jehu's grandson, which he seems to have intended at first to dispatch in the short space of four verses (vers. 10-13). He afterwards, however, saw reason to add to his narrative, first, an account of an interview between Joash and Elisha, shortly Before the death of the latter (vers. 14-19); secondly, an account of a miracle wrought soon afterwards by means of Elisha's corpse (vers. 20, 21); and thirdly, a brief notice of Joash's Syrian war (vers. 22-25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and seventh year of Joash King of Judah.</span> Three years before his death, since he reigned forty years  (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>).

And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Elisha, was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.</span> Elisha, who was grown to manhood before the death of Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>), must have been at least eighty years old at the accession of Joash: His illness was therefore probably the result of mere natural decay. <span class="cmt_word">And Joash the King of Israel came down unto him.</span> The visit of a king to a prophet, in the way of sympathy and compliment, would be a very unusual occurrence at any period of the world's history. In the East, and at the period of which the historian is treating, it was probably unprecedented. Prophets waited upon kings, not kings upon prophets: If a king came to a prophet's house, it was likely to be on an errand of vengeance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>), not on one of kindness and sympathy. The act of Joash certainly implies a degree of tenderness and consideration on tits part very uncommon at the time, and is a fact to which much weight should be attached in any estimate that we form of his character. He was, at any rate, a prince of an amiable disposition. <span class="cmt_word">And wept over his face</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, leant over the sick man as he lay on his bed, and shed tears, some of which fell on him - <span class="cmt_word">and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</span> As Elisha had addressed Elijah, when he was quitting the earth (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>), so Joash now addressed the dying Elisha, using exactly the same words, not (certainly) by a mere coincidence. Joash must have known the circumstances of Elijah's departure, which had probably been entered before this in the 'Book of the Kings,' and intended pointedly to allude to them. "O my father, my father," he meant to say, "when Elijah was taken from the earth, thou didst exclaim that the defense of Israel was gone" (see the comment on 2 Kings 2:12): "how much more must it be true that it is gone now, when thou art on the point of departure! He left thee as his successor; thou leavest no one!" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-15.htm">2 Kings 13:15</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows.</span> The prophet was moved, no doubt, by a sudden inspiration he was bidden to assure the weeping king of victory - speedy victory-over Syria. The defense of Israel would not fail because he  - a mere weak instrument by whom God had been pleased to work - was taken from the earth. God would bless the king's own efforts. "Take bow and arrows," he exclaims under the prophetic afflatus. "Take them at once into thine hands, and do my bidding." Words would not have been enough; greater assurance and conviction was produced when prophecy took the shape of a symbolical action (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-3.htm">Jeremiah 18:3, 4</a>, etc.). So the Spirit of the Lord moved the prophet to the performance of a symbolical act, or set of acts, which the historian now proceeds to describe. <span class="cmt_word">And he took unto him how and arrows.</span> Joash would take these from the hands of his attendants, who might be carrying his own special weapons after him, as was the practice in Persia ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. p. 161), or who would at any rate have arms of their own, since they would wait upon him not merely as attendants, but as guards. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-16.htm">2 Kings 13:16</a></div><div class="verse">And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.

The intention was, no doubt, as Keil says, "to show that the power which was to be given to the bow-shot" was not the king's own power, but "came from the Lord through the mediation of his prophet."

The prophet ordered the shutter to be opened, that the king might shoot from the window. He addressed, not the king, whose hands were both engaged, but his own servant, or one of the royal attendants. <span class="cmt_word">Eastward</span>. Not so much in the direction of Syria, which was north-east of the Israelite territory, as in the direction of Gilead and Bashan, which had been the scene of Hazael's victories (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>), and was now to be the scene of his reverses. Aphek lay almost duo east of Shunem, where it is probable that Elisha was. <span class="cmt_word">And he opened it</span>; or, <span class="accented">and one opened it</span>, or <span class="accented">they opened it</span>.

"This is," the prophet meant to say, "an arrow symbolical of deliverance about to come from Jehovah, of deliverance from the cruel oppression of the Syrians" - and not merely of deliverance, but of victory. <span class="cmt_word">For thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek.</span> The Aphek intended is probably that which lay east of the Sea of Galilee, at the distance of about three miles, in lat. 32&deg; 49' nearly. This place was on the direct route between Samaria and Damascus, and had already been the scene of one great victory gained by Israel over Syria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26-30</a>). The site is marked by the modern village of <span class="accented">Fik</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Till thou have consumed them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till consuming - i.e.</span>, till the army which thou shalt defeat at that place is destroyed utterly.

Keil and Bahr, on the contrary, think that the order was to shoot the arrows down from the window and hit the earth with them. But some contrast seems to be intended between the "shoot" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 19 and the "strike" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>) of the present passage. Ewald's explanation is thus to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">And he smote thrice, and stayed.</span> Joash struck with the arrows against the floor three times, and then paused, thinking he had done enough. He did not enter into the spirit of the symbolical act, which represented the smiting and slaying of enemies. Perhaps he had not much faith in the virtue of the symbolism, which he may even, with the arrogance of a proud and worldly minded man, have thought childish. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-19.htm">2 Kings 13:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed <i>it</i>: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria <i>but</i> thrice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">was wroth with him.</span> Elisha was angered at the lukewarmness of Joash, and his lack of faith and zeal. He himself, from his higher standpoint, saw the greatness of the opportunity, the abundance of favor which God was ready to grant, and the way in which God's favor was stinted and narrowed by Joash's want of receptiveness. Had the king been equal to the occasion, a full end might at once have been made of Syria, and Israel might have been enabled to brace herself for the still more perilous struggle with Assyria, in which she ultimately succumbed. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it.</span> It has been suggested that Joash associated the number throe with the notion of completeness, and "thought that what was done thrice was done perfectly" (Bahr); but in this case the prophet would scarcely have been angered. It is far more consonant with the entire narrative to suppose that he stopped from mere weariness, and want of strong faith and zeal. If he had been earnestly desirous of victory, and had had faith in the symbolical action as divinely directed, he would have kept on smiting till the prophet told him it was enough, or at any rate would have smitten the ground five or six times instead of three. The idea that he abstained from modesty or from prudence, "lest too extravagant demands might deprive him of all" (Von Gerlach), finds no support in the text of the narrative. He abstained (as Keil says) because "he was wanting in the proper zeal for obtaining the full promises of God." Had it been otherwise, the complete success obtained by Jeroboam II. (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-25.htm">2 Kings 4:25-28</a>) might have been anticipated by the space of fifteen or twenty years. <span class="cmt_word">Whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice</span> (comp. ver. 25, which declares that this prophecy was exactly accomplished). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-20.htm">2 Kings 13:20</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha died, and they buried him.

All the more anxious, therefore, would the Israelites be to bury their second great prophet with due honor. They prepared him, no doubt, one of those excavated sepulchers which were usual at the time and in the country - a squared or vaulted chamber cut in the native rock. St. Jerome says that the place of his sepulture was near Samaria ('Epitaph. Paulae'), and this is sufficiently probable; but in the Middle Ages his grave was shown at Ruma, in Galilee (Ewald, 'Hist. of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 122, note 3). According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 6), his funeral was magnificent. <span class="cmt_word">And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</span> It seems to be implied that this was a usual occurrence. Just as the Syrians in the days of Naaman made marauding raids into the land from time to time (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2</a>), so now the Moabites each spring made an incursion. The weakness of Israel is strongly marked by this fact, and still more by the penetration of the Moabites so deep into their country. <a href="../../par/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a> perhaps glances at these incursions of Moab.

At the moment of contact the dead man came to life  - "revived." <span class="cmt_word">And stood up on his feet.</span> In many Jewish tombs the sepulchral chamber would allow of this.

All the others had fallen short more or less; and Amaziah fell short in many respects. He was wanting in "a perfect heart" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fixed intention to do God's will; he was proud and boastful (ver. 10); he gave way to idolatry in his later years (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>), and he despised the reproof of the prophet who was sent to rebuke his sin (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-16.htm">2 Chronicles 25:16</a>). Though placed among the "good kings' by the authors of both Kings and Chronicles, it is, as it were, under protest, with a distinct intimation that, although better than most of his predecessors, he did not reach a high standard. <span class="cmt_word">He did according to all things as Joash his father did.</span> There is something of Oriental hyperbole in this statement, which must be understood in the spirit, not in the letter. The two kings were differently circumstanced, and history did not "repeat itself" in their reigns. The position of Joash with respect to Jehoiada finds no parallel in the circumstances of the life of Amaziah. Still, the lives are parallel to some extent. Both kings began better than they ended. Both were zealous for Jehovah at first, but turned to idolatry at last. Both opposed themselves to prophets, and treated their rebukes with scorn. Both reused conspiracy against them by their misconduct, and were murdered by the malcontents. Further, both were unsuccessful in war, had to withstand a siege of their capital, and bought off their enemy by the surrender of the greater part of its wealth, including the treasures of the temple (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> with <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>).

Even Asa did not remove them (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>). They were remnants of an old ancestral worship which went back to the time of the judges, and which had been connived at by judges and kings and prophets. Local feeling was everywhere in their favor, since they provided for local needs, and enabled men to dispense with the long] and tedious journey to the distant Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places</span>; literally, <span class="accented">were sacrificing and burning incense</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> continued the practice, which had come down to them from their ancestors.

A time of trouble had, no doubt, supervened. The conspirators would not wish to see Amaziah placed upon the throne, and may have opposed and delayed his appointment. But their efforts proved fruitless. After a time, the young king was confirmed (literally, "strengthened"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> settled and established in his kingdom, all opposition being overcome or dying away. This seems to be what the writer means. He cannot intend a confirmation by a foreign suzerain, which the phrase used might import (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>), when he has given no hint of any subjection of the kingdom to any foreign power, or indeed of any serious attack on its independence. <span class="cmt_word">That he slew his servants.</span> Jozachar and Jehozabad were "servants" of Joash, apparently domestic servants employed in his palace, and are therefore reckoned "servants" also of his successor. <span class="cmt_word">Which had slain the king his father.</span> In the "house of Millo,' where he lay sick.

A Greek poet went so far as to say that a man was a fool who put to death the father, and allowed the son to live. The practice had a double ground. Sons, it might be assumed, would be cognizant of their father's intention, and would so be accessories before the fact. And the law of <span class="accented">claim</span>, or "blood-feud," would make it dangerous to spare them, since they would be bound to avenge their father's death on his destroyer. That the practice prevailed among the Israelites appears from <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>, where we find the children of Achan involved in his fate, and again from <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>, where we are told that Naboth's sons suffered with their father.

In either case the passage is fatal to the theory of the late' composition of Deuteronomy, which is here found to have ruled the conduct of a Jewish king a hundred and fifty years before Manasseh, two hundred before Josiah, and two hundred and eighty before the return from the Captivity - the dates assigned to Deuteronomy by recent "advanced" critics. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> As usual, when one sacred writer quotes another, the quotation is not exact. "But" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) is inserted at the beginning of the final clause, and the form of the verb in the same clause is modified. It seems to be intended that we should be made to feel that it is the sentiment or meaning conveyed, and not the phraseology in which it is wrapped up, that is of importance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand.</span> Edom had revolted from Judah and recovered complete independence in the reign of Jehoram, about fifty years previously (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>). Since that time the two countries had remained at peace. Now, however, Amaziah resolved upon a great effort to resubjugate them. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 1) and Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), he levied an army of 400,000 men - 300,000 Jews, and 100,000 hired Israelites - with which he marched against the three nations of the Amalekites, the Idumaeans, and the Gabalites. Rebuked by a prophet for want of faith in calling to his aid the wicked Israelites, he consented to dismiss them, and made the invasion at the head of his own troops only. These were carefully organized (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), and met with a great success. Ten thousand of his enemies fell in battle, and an equal number were made prisoners. These last were barbarously put to death by being precipitated from the top of a rock (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-12.htm">2 Chronicles 25:12</a>). "The valley of salt," the scene of the battle, is probably identified with the sunken plain, now called <span class="accented">Es Sabkah</span>, at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. This is "a large flat of at least six miles by ten, occasionally flooded" (Tristram), but dry in the summertime. It is full of salt springs, and is bounded on the west and northwest by a long ridge of pure salt, known as the <span class="accented">Khasm Usdum</span>, so that the name "valley of salt" would be very appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">And took Selah by war.</span> Selah with the article (<span class="accented">has-Selah</span>) can only be the Idumaean capital, which the Greeks called Petra (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and which is one of the most remarkable sites in the world. In the rocky mountains which form the eastern boundary of the Arabah or sandy slope reaching from the edge of the Sabkah to the Red Sea, amid cliffs of gorgeous colors, pink and crimson and purple, and ravines as deep and narrow as that of Proffers, partly excavated in the rook, partly emplaced upon it, stood the Edomite town, difficult to approach, still more difficult to capture, more like the home of a colony of sea-gulls than that of a number of men. Petra is graphically described by Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 88-92), and has also received notice from Robinson ('Researches,' vol. it. pp. 518-538), Highten ('Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 3. p. 1191), and others. <span class="cmt_word">And called the name of it Joktheel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "subdued by God." The name took no permanent hold. Selah is still "Sela" in Isaiah (Isaiah 16:1), Obadiah (ver. Obadiah 1:3), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:16). It is known only as "Petra" to the Greeks and Romans. <span class="cmt_word">Unto this day</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the time of the writer who composed the account of Amaziah's reign for the 'Book of the Kings,' and whoso words the author of Kings transcribes here as so often elsewhere. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, King of Israel, saying.</span> Amaziah had a cause of complaint against Jehoash, or at any rate against his subjects, which does not appear in the narrative of Kings. The author of Chronicles tells us that, when Amaziah dismissed his Israelite mercenaries, they were offended, and vented their anger by an inroad into his territories (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-13.htm">2 Chronicles 25:13</a>), where they killed three thousand men and "took much spoil." This was a clear casus <span class="accented">belli</span>, if Amaziah chose to consider it such. <span class="cmt_word">Come, let us look one another in the face.</span> A rude message, if it was actually couched in these terms. But perhaps the writer substitutes the gist of the message for the language in which it was wrapped up. Josephus says that Amaziah wrote a letter to Joash, and required him to submit himself and people to the authority of the Jewish state, and thus restore the state of things which had existed under David and Solomon. Otherwise the sword must decide between them ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 2). Whatever its terms, pride and self-confidence, the result of his success against Edom, were at the root of the challenge.

And the thistle sent to the cypress, saying,' Contract thy daughter in marriage to my son.' And while this was transacting, a wild beast passed by and trod down the thistle. Let this be a warning to thee not to cherish immoderate desires, and not, because thou hast had success against Amalek, to pride thyself thereupon, and so draw down dangers both upon thee and upon thy kingdom." The force of the original message is much weakened in this paraphrase. <span class="cmt_word">The thistle that was in Lebanon.</span> "Thistle" is a better translation than "thorn-bush" (Keil), first, as a meaner, growth, and secondly, as more likely to be trodden down by a wild beast. The monarch intends to say that the meanest thing in the vegetable world sent to the grandest, claiming equality. <span class="cmt_word">Sent to the cedar</span> - certainly "the cedar." and not "the cypress," as translated by Josephus - <span class="cmt_word">that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife.</span> <span class="accented">Nube pari</span> was a Roman maxim; and the rule was one generally established throughout the ancient world.

Its position is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Ain-Shems</span>, which lies nearly due west of Jerusalem, on the road from Hebron to Jaffa. Ain-Shems itself is an Arab village, but "just to the west of it are the manifest traces of an ancient site" (Robinson, 'Researches,' vol. 3. p. 17). The position commands the approach from the Philistine plain; and we may suspect that Joash, avoiding the direct line of approach, led his troops to the attack through Philistia, as was so often done by the Syrians in their attacks on the Maccabees (see 1 Macc. 3:40 1 Macc. 13:12, 13 1 Macc. 15:40 1 Macc. 16:4-8, etc.).

It is more likely to have sprung out of dissatisfaction with Amaziah's military inaction from and after his defeat by Joash. While Jeroboam H. was carrying all before him in the north, recovering his border, pushing it as far as Hamath, and even exercising a suzerainty over Damascus (vers. 25, 28), Amaziah remained passive, cowed by his one defeat, and took no advantage of the state of weakness to which he had reduced Edom, but sat with folded hands, doing nothing. The conspirators who removed Amaziah, and placed his son Azariah, or Uzziah, upon the throne, may be credited with the wish and intention to bring the period of inaction to an end, and to effect in the south what Jeroboam was effecting in the north. It is true that Azariah was but sixteen years of age (ver. 21; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>), but he may have given indications of his ambition and capacity. Sixteen, moreover, is the time of manhood in the East, and the conspirators had probably waited until Azariah was sixteen in order that his competency to reign should not be disputed. As soon as he was on the throne he initiated the warlike policy which they desired (see ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And he fled to Lachish.</span> Lachish, one of the south-western Judaean towns (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), was at all times a fortress of importance. It resisted Joshua (Joshua 10:3, 31), and was taken by storm. It was fortified by Jeroboam against the Egyptians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>). It was besieged and taken by Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152).

Josephus is silent. <span class="cmt_word">Which was sixteen years old.</span> Young certainly, considering that his father was fifty-four (see ver. 2), but not necessarily "a younger son," since Amaziah's earlier children may have been daughters, or he may have married late in life.

The difference between them is not so great in the Hebrew, where they both begin with the same letter; but still it is considerable. One name is not a mere contraction of the other. Some suppose that the king changed one name for the other upon his accession; others, that he was called indifferently by either, since they were very similar in meaning. "Azariah" is "he whose help is Jehovah;" "Uzziah," "he whose strength is Jehovah." "Uzziah" is the predominant form, occurring four times in 2 Kings, twelve times in 2 Chronicles, three times in Isaiah, once in Hoses, once in Amos, and once in Zechariah; while "Azariah" occurs only in 2 Kings (eight times) and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> (once). Josephus uses the form "Ozias" (equivalent to, Uzziah), and so does St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8, 9</a>).

Hamath itself was between eighty and ninety miles further to the north, on the middle Orontes, about N. lat. 35&deg; 22'.

The territory recovered no doubt included all the trans-Jordanic region as far south as the river Aruon; but the recovery of dominion over Moab, and even over Ammon, which some have seen in this passage (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 124), is scarcely con-rained in it. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>).

The repetition is perhaps to be accounted for by the desire of the writer to explain how it came to pass that so great a deliverance was granted to Israel under a king who maintained the worship of the calves. He views it as the consequence of God's infinite compassion, and of the extreme bitterness of Israel's sufferings under the Syrians (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a> and <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For there was not any shut up, nor any left</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 14:10), <span class="cmt_word">nor any helper for Israel.</span> Apart from Jehovah, Israel had no one to come to her aid.

But there does not seem to be any sufficient reason for giving the words used this narrow signification. Damascus was conquered and annexed by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), and held for a time even by Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), of whose kingdom Hamath also seems to have formed part (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>). The word "recovered" is, therefore, a suitable one. The prophecy of Amos, no doubt, represents Damascus as independent (<a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3, 4</a>); but this may have been written before Jeroboam conquered it. Hamath's subjection seems to be implied in <a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2, 14</a>. We may, therefore, well understand, with Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 124) and Dr. Pusey ('Minor Prophets,' pp, 157, 209), that Jeroboam . ' subdued Damascus and even <span class="accented">Hamath</span>," and added them to his kingdom. How long the subjection continued is a different question. Probably, in the troubles that followed the death of Zachariah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10-14</a>), the yoke was thrown off. In the Assyrian Inscriptions, Damascus appears under its own king about  <span class="date">B.C. 786</span> (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 115), and it was certainly independent in  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>. At the latter date Hamath also appears as the capital of an independent kingdom (ibid., pp. 118, 120) under its own monarch. <span class="cmt_word">Which belonged to Judah.</span> Keil and Bahr render,"Hamath <span class="accented">of</span> Judah," regarding <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> as a genitive.

Either, therefore, Azariah must have begun to reign in the fifteenth year of Jeroboam, or there must have been an interregnum of twelve years between the death of Amaziah and the accession of Azariah.

Josephus uses still stronger expressions. "Azariah was," he says (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>), "a good king, naturally just and high-minded, and indefatigable in his administration of affairs." According to the author of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>), he "sought God in the days of Zechariah."

We have to go to Chronicles for an explanation. By Chronicles it appears that, in the earlier portion of his reign, Azariah was a good and pious prince, and that God blessed him in all his undertakings. Not only did he recover Eloth (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-2.htm">2 Chronicles 26:2</a>), but he carried on a successful war with the Philistines - took Garb, Jabneh (Jamnia), and Ashdod, and dismantled them (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), defeated the Arabians of Gur-Baal, and the Mehuuim or Maonites (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a>), forced the Ammonites to pay him a tribute, and caused his power to be known and feared far and wide (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>). The standing army which he maintained numbered 307,500 men, under 2600 officers, well armed and equipped with shields, spears, helmets, breast-plates, bows, and slings (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12-14</a>). "His name spread far abroad, for he was wonderfully helped" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>). This marvelous prosperity developed in him a pride equal to that of his father, but one which vented itself differently, Azariab, deeming himself superior to all other men, and exempt from ordinary rules, boldly invaded the priestly office, took a censer, and entered into the temple, and proceeded to burn incense upon the golden altar that was before the veil (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-18</a>). It was then that "the Lord smote the king." As, in defiance of the high priest and his attendant train, who sought to prevent the lawless act, Azariah persisted in his endeavors, God struck him with leprosy, his forehead grew white with the unmistakable scaly scab, and in a moment his indomitable pride was quelled. The priests closed in upon him and began to thrust him out, but no violence was necessary. Aware of what had happened, "he himself also hasted to go out, because the Lord had smitten him" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>). It is not very clear why the writer of Kings passes over these facts; but certainly they are not discredited by his silence. At any rate, those who accept the entire series of conquests, whereof the writer of Kings says nothing, on the sole authority of Chronicles, are logically precluded from rejecting the circumstances accompanying the leprosy, which is acknowledged by the writer of Kings, and viewed as a judgment from God. <span class="cmt_word">So that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>). Lepers had to be separated from the congregation - to "dwell alone" - "without the camp" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). Ahaziah's "several house" is regarded by some as an "infirmary," or "hospital for lepers" (Ewald, Gesenius, Winer); but there is no reason to believe that hospitals of any kind existed among the Israelites. The lepers mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-3.htm">2 Kings 7:3</a> are houseless. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> is best translated "house of separation" and understood of a house standing by itself in the open country, separate from others. "Probably the house in which the leprous king lived was," as Bahr says, "especially built for him." <span class="cmt_word">And Jotham the Mug's son was over the house</span> - not over the "several house," but over the royal palace - <span class="cmt_word">judging the people of the land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> executing the royal functions, whereof "judging" was one of the highest. Azariah's infirmity made a regency necessary, and naturally his eldest son held the office.

Azariah, he tells us (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-23.htm">2 Chronicles 26:23</a>), was not buried in the rock-sepulcher which contained the bodies of the other kings, but in another part of the field wherein the sepulcher was situated.

FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE JEHU. The writer has nothing to record of Zachariah but his murder by Shallum after a reign of six months. Vers. 8, 9, and 11 contain the usual formula. Ver. 10 gives the only event that needed record. Ver. 12 recalls to the reader's attention a previous passage, in which a prophecy had been mentioned, whereof Zachariah's reign was the fulfillment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah King of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria.</span> If Azariah began to reign in the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam (ver. 1), and Jeroboam died in his forty-first or forty-second year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>), Zachariah must have ascended the throne in the fifteenth or sixteenth year of Azariah. Even if Azariah became king in the fifteenth of Jeroboam, as has been shown to be probable (see the comment on ver. 1), Zachariah's accession cannot have been earlier than Azariah's twenty-sixth year. An interregnum between the death of Jeroboam and the accession of Zachariah is not to be thought cf. <span class="cmt_word">Six months</span>. So also Josephus (see 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:11. &sect; 1).

Ewald sought to solve the difficulty by inventing a king, "Zobolam," but other critics have found this expedient too bold. The rendering of our translators is generally accepted, though <span class="accented">qobal</span>, "before," only occurs here and in Daniel. If we accept this rendering, we must suppose that the act of violence was done openly, like Jehu's murder of Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">And slew him, and reigned in his stead</span> (comp. ver. 13).

There had not been wanting other indications of the coming troubles. Hosea had declared that God would avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu (<a href="../../par/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>). Amos had gone further, and had openly proclaimed that God would "rise against the house of Jeroboam <span class="accented">with the sword"</span> (<a href="../../par/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>). The threat had been understood as a threat against Jeroboam himself (<a href="../../par/amos/7-11.htm">Amos 7:11</a>), but this was a misinterpretation. The words plainly pointed, to a revolution in the time of his son. <span class="cmt_word">And so it came to pass.</span> The house of Jehu ceased to reign in the fourth generation of the descendants of its founder. No considerations of prudence or of gratitude could keep the nation faithful to any dynasty for a longer time than this. In breaking off from the divinely chosen house of David, and choosing to themselves a king, the Israelites had sown the seeds of instability in their state, and put themselves at the mercy of any ambitious pretender. Five dynasties had already borne rule in the two hundred years that the kingdom had lasted; four more were about to hold the throne in the remaining fifty years of its existence. "Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel," though said of Reuben only (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), fairly expressed the character of the entire kingdom, with which Reuben cast in its lot at the time of the separation.

It has been thought that Menahem could not have pushed his conquests so far, and a second Tiphsah has been invented in the Israelite highland, between Tirzah and Samaria, of which there is no other notice anywhere. But "Tiphsah," which means "passage" or "fordway," is an unsuitable name for a city in such a situation. The view of Keil is clearly tenable - that Zachariah had intended to carry on his father's warlike policy, and had collected an army for a great Eastern expedition, which had its head-quarters at the royal city of Tirzah, and was under the command of Menahem. As the expedition was about to start, the news came that Shallum had murdered Zachariah and usurped the throne. Menahem upon this proceeded from Tirzah to Samaria, crushed Shallum, and, returning to his army, carried out without further delay the expedition already resolved upon. The Assyrian records show that, at the probable date of the expedition, Assyria was exceptionally weak, and in no condition to resist an attack, though a little later, under Tiglath-pileser, she recovered herself<span class="cmt_word">.

The greatest doubt has been entertained with regard to the identity of Pul, whose name does not appear in the Assyrian Eponym Canon, or in any other purely Assyrian document. But recently discovered Babylonian documents seem to prove that Pul (Pulu) was the Babylonian name for Tiglath-pileser, who reigned under that name in Babylon during his last two years, and appears in the Canon of Ptolemy as "Porus." Tiglath-pileser, the great founder of the later Assyrian empire, made himself king in  <span class="date">B.C. 745</span>, and proceeded to consolidate the Assyrian power on every side, after a period of great weakness and disorganization. He made several expeditions against Babylonia, and several into Syria and Palestine. The expedition in which he came into contact with Menahem is thought to have been that of his eighth year,  <span class="date">B.C. 738</span> (see G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 117-120; and, for the identity of Tiglath-pileser with Pul, see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1884, p. 198). <span class="cmt_word">And Menahem gave Pal a thousand talents of silver.</span> A vast sum certainly, equal to above a quarter of a million of our money, perhaps to some extent a punishment for the siege and sack of Tiphsah.

The writer is again exceedingly brief. Pekah's reign was a remarkable one, and might have furnished much material to the historian. In conjunction with Rezin of Damascus, he made war upon Judaea, defeated Ahaz with great loss (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>), and laid siege to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>). Ahaz called in the aid or' Assyria, and Tiglath-pileser made two expeditions into Palestine - the one mentioned in ver. 29, and another some years afterwards. In the latter he seems to have had the assistance of Hoshea, who, with his sanction, slew Pekah, and became king. The scanty notices of our author must be supplemented from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-8</a>; and the Assyrian inscriptions. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah King of Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the thirty-ninth or thirty-eighth year</span> (see the comment on ver. 23).

Tiglath-pileser's entire reign lasted only eighteen years, yet it more than covered the entire reign of Pekah. When he first invaded the kingdom of Samaria, Menahem was upon the throne ('Eponym Canon,' p. 120, line 29); when he last attacked it, probably in  <span class="date">B.C. 730</span> - two years before his death in  <span class="date">B.C. 728</span> - he set up Hoshea, or, at any rate, sanctioned his usurpation (ibid., pp. 123, 124, lines 15-18).

His first expedition into Syria is thought, however, to have been in his third year,  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>, but there is no evidence that, on this occasion, he proceeded further south than Damascus, where he took tribute from Rezin. Some years after this -  <span class="date">B.C. 738</span>, according to Mr. G. Smith - he penetrated to Palestine, where his chief enemy was Azariah King of Judah, who had united under his sway most of the tribes as far as Hamath. After chastising Azariah, he extended his dominion over most of the neighboring states and kingdoms; and it was at this time that (as related in ver. 19) he took tribute from Menahem. Subsequently (about  <span class="date">B.C. 734</span>) he made an expedition for the purpose of conquest, which receives very scant notice, in one inscription only. This is probably the expedition of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">And took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah.</span> These were places in the extreme north of the Israelite territory, in the vicinity of the Lake Merem, such as would naturally be among the first to fall before an Assyrian invader (on their exact position, see the comment on 1 Kings 15:20). <span class="cmt_word">And Janoah.</span> Janoah is now generally regarded as identical with the modern <span class="accented">Hunin</span>, a village close by "an ancient fortress of great strength" (Robinson, 'Later Researches,' p. 371), in the hill country northwest of Merom.

Hazer was in the near neighborhood of Kedesh, towards the south probably. The exact position is disputed. Robinson's arguments in favor of El-Khu reibch are weighty; but the engineers employed by the Palestine Exploration Fund regard Khurbat-Harrah, between Kedesh and the Lake Merom, as a still more probable situation. <span class="cmt_word">And Gilead.</span> "Gilead," in this connection, can scarcely be "the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan" (Keil, Bahr) - the territory of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, not of Naphtali.

The inscription of Tiglath-pileser, which appears to allude to this expedition, mentions "Galhi," and "Abel" (probably Abel-beth-maachah) as conquered at this time, and "added to Assyria."

He was careful and watchful over the city; whatever needed reparation or adornment, he labored to supply strenuously, as the porticoes in the temple and the gates thereof; and where any part of the wall had gone to ruin, he raised it up again, and built towers of vast size and difficult to capture. And in all other matters pertaining to the kingdom, where there had been neglect, he applied great care and attention."

It must have become amply evident to the kings of Judah, at any rate from the time of the attack on Menahem (ver. 19), that the independence of both kingdoms was menaced by Assyria, and that it was of great importance that their principal fortresses should be placed in a state of efficient defense. Azariah had paid great attention to the fortifying and arming of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9, 15</a>), and his son now followed in his footsteps. From <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a> we learn that he not only built the high gate of the temple, but also "on the wall of Ophel built much," Nor was he content with fortifying the capital. He also "built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers." Tiglath-pileser had made war on his father ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 117, 118). He felt that any day his own turn might come.

As the writer of Chronicles says (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>), "He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, <span class="accented">and made also molten images for Baalim</span>." <span class="accented">Baalim</span> is either a plural of dignity, or a word denoting the different forms under which Baal was worshipped, as Melkarth, Adonis, Rimmon, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and made his son to pass through the fire.</span> In Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>) we are told that "he burnt incense in the valley of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire," as if he had sacrificed more than one son. The practice of offering children in sacrifice was not a feature of the Assyro-Babylonian religion, as some suppose, but an intrinsic part of the worship of the Phoenicians, common to them with the Moabites, Ammonites, and others. It was based upon the principle of a man's offering to God that which was dearest and most precious to himself, whence the crowning sacrifice of the kind was a man's offering of his firstborn son (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). Some have supposed that the rite was a mere dedication or lustration, the children passing between two fires, and being thenceforward employed only in God's service. But the expressions used by the sacred writer and others, and still more the descriptions that have come down to us from heathen and patristic authors, make it absolutely certain that the "passing through the fire' was no such innocent ceremony as this, but involved the death of the children. The author of Chronicles says, "Ahaz <span class="accented">burnt</span> his children in the fire;" <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>, "They have built also the high places of Baal, <span class="accented">to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings</span> unto Baal;" <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>, "Thou hast <span class="accented">slain</span> my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire." Josephus declares of Ahaz that he "made his own son a whole burnt offering (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>)." Diodorus Sicalus describes the ceremony as it took place at Carthage, the Phoenician colony. There was in the great temple there, he says, an image of Saturn (Moloch), which was a human figure with a bull's head and outstretched arms. This image of metal was made glowing hot by a fire kindled within it; and the children, laid in its arms, rolled from thence into the fiery lap below. If the children cried, the parents stopped their noise by fondling and kissing them; for the victim ought not to weep, and the sound of complaint was drowned in the din of flutes and kettle-drums (Died. Sic., 20:14). "Mothers," says Plutarch ('De Superstitione,' &sect; 13), "stood by without tears or sobs; if they wept or sobbed, they lost the honor of the act, and the children were sacrificed notwithstanding." The only doubtful point is whether the children were placed alive in the glowing arms of the image, or whether they were first killed and afterwards burnt in sacrifice; but the description of Diodorus seems to imply the more cruel of the two proceedings. <span class="cmt_word">According to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord east out from before the children of Israel.</span> (On the practice of this terrible rite by the Canaanitish nations at the time of the Israelite invasion, see <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37, 38</a>.)

It began, apparently, in the reign of Jotham. The policy which brought it about was one that was entirely new. Since Syria developed an aggressive tendency under the first Ben-hadad (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), there had till now been no alliance made with her by either of the two Israelite kingdoms. She had been reckoned as their common enemy; and while they had on two occasions been allied together against her (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28</a>), never as yet had either asked her help against the other. Now, however, Ephraim became confederate with Syria against Judah. The new policy must be ascribed to the new condition of things consequent upon the attitude assumed by Assyria under Tiglath-pileser. Assyria had been under a cloud for forty years. The nations of the western coast of Asia had ceased to fear her, and had felt at liberty to pursue their own quarrels. Her recovery of vigor altered the whole situation. It was at once evident to the statesmen who directed the policy of the small western states that, unless they combined; they were lost. Hence the alliance between Pekah and Rezin. Probably they would have been glad to have drawn Ahaz into the confederacy; but it would seem that he did not share their fears, and would not join them. Hereupon the design was formed to dethrone him, and set up in his place a new ruler, a certain Ben-Tabeal (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>), on whose assistance they could rely. The two confederate princes then began the campaign. Pekah invaded Judaea, and gained a great victory over Ahaz, which is perhaps exaggerated in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-15</a>; Rezin carried his arms further south, took Elath, and reestablished the Edomites in power (see the comment on ver. 6). Then the allies joined forces and proceeded to besiege Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And they besieged Ahaz,</span> but could not ever-come him. The siege is mentioned by <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>, who was commissioned by God to comfort Ahaz, and assure him that the city would not fall (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-7.htm">Isaiah 7:7</a>). The fortifications of Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>) and Jotham (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) had, no doubt, greatly strengthened the city since the time when (as related in <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>) it was captured so easily by Joash. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time Rezin, King of Syria recovered Elath to Syria.</span> The Syrians had certainly never previously been masters of Elath, which had always hitherto been either Jewish or Edomite (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>).

Humanly speaking, he might be justified. He had not called in one foreign power until Pekah had called in another. There was no other prospect (again humanly speaking) of escape. But, had he accepted the offers of <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>, and relied wholly on Jehovah, his position would have been far better. However, he was unable to see this; he made his application; and Tiglath-pileser "came up," and utterly crushed the Syro-Israelite confederacy  (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, saying.</span> This appeal to man rather than to God, this trust in "an arm of flesh," was exactly what Isaiah had been endeavoring to prevent, what he viewed as unfaithfulness, and as inevitably drawing down God's wrath both upon king and kingdom. Ahaz was young, was weak, and had no doubt a large body of advisers, who considered the prophet to be a fanatic, who had no belief in supernatural aid, and who thought that in any emergency recourse was to be had to the measures which human prudence and human policy dictated. The aid of Tiglath-pileser seemed to them, under the circumstances, the only thing that could save them; and they persuaded the weak prince to adopt their views. <span class="cmt_word">I am thy servant and thy son.</span> The offer of submission was unmistakable. "Servant," in the language of the time, meant "slave." Complete subjection, enrollment among Assyria's feudatories, the entire loss of independence, was well understood to be the price that had to be paid for Assyria's protection. Ahaz and his worldly advisers were prepared to pay it. They surrendered themselves, body and soul, into the hands of the great world-power of the period. <span class="cmt_word">Come up, and save me out of the hand of the King of Syria, and out of the hand of the King of Israel, which rise up against me.</span> Syria is put forward as at once the more formidable of the two foes, and the one most open to Assyrian attack. Already Damascus had been more than once menaced by Assyrian armies ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 113, 115, 116), while the kingdom of Samaria had only suffered at her extremities (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). Samaria could not well be approached excepting through Syria, and after Syria's downfall.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried <i>the people of</i> it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria hearkened unto him.</span> Overtures of the kind were almost certain to be accepted. The great conquering monarchs of the East were always glad to receive small states into their alliance for a time, and even to allow them a shadow of independence, while they made use of their services against their near neighbors. Tiglath-pileser was already bent on conquering Samaria and Damascus, and could not fail to perceive that their subjugation would be greatly facilitated by his having the support of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">For the King of Assyria</span>  - rather, <span class="accented">and the King of Assyria - went</span> up against Damascus. Damascus was naturally attacked first, as nearer to Assyria than Samaria, and also as more wealthy and more important. Tiglath-pileser's records contain an account of the campaign, but it is unfortunately much mutilated. We may gather from it, however, that Resin began by meeting his assailant in the field, and engaging him in a battle which was stoutly contested. Eventually the Assyrians were victorious, and Resin, having fled hastily to Damascus, shut himself up within its walls. Tiglath-pileser pursued him, laid siege to the city, and eventually took it, though not perhaps till it had resisted for above a year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 65). The Assyrian monarch thus describes the siege (ibid., p. 121): "Damascus, his city, I besieged, and like a caged bird I enclosed him. His forests, the trees of which were without number, I cut down; I did not leave a tree standing. [I burnt] Hadara, the house of the father of Rezin, King of Syria." <span class="cmt_word">And took it.</span> The ancient Damascene kingdom, which had lasted from the time of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), was thus brought to an end. Damascus gave the Assyrians no further trouble; and within little more than thirty years it had been so absolutely absorbed into the empire that its governor was one of the Assyrian eponyms ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68). The capture of the city, foretold by <a href="../../par/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4, 5</a>, was followed by the destruction of its walls and palaces. <span class="cmt_word">And carried the people of it captive.</span> The system of transplanting large masses of the population from one part of the empire to another seems to have begun with Tiglath-pileser. In his very imperfect and fragmentary annals we find the removal of above thirty thousand captives recorded, of whom more than half are women. His example was followed by his successors on a still larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">To Kir</span>. The situation of "Kir" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) is wholly uncertain. It has been identified with Kis (Elam or Kissia); with the country watered by the Kur; with Kourena or Koura, on the river Mardus; with Karine, the modern Kirrind; with Kirkhi near Diartekr; and with Kiransi in the Urumiyeh country. But the similarity of sound is the sole basis for each and all of these identifications. It is best to confess our ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">And slew Rezin.</span> This is perhaps implied, but it is not distinctly stated, in the extant annals of Tiglath-pileser. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that <i>was</i> at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-18.</span> - <span class="accented">Religious changes introduced into Judea by Ahaz</span>. The new position into which Ahaz had brought himself with respect to Assyria was followed by certain religious changes, which were probably, in part at any rate, its consequence, though some of them may have been the result of his own religious (or irreligious) convictions. He had a new altar made and introduced into the temple, which at first he used for his own private sacrifices (vers. 10-13); then, that his new altar might occupy the pest of honor, he removed from its place the old brazen altar of Solomon, and put it in an inferior position (ver. 14). After this, he required all sacrifices to be offered on the new altar (ver. 15). Finally, he proceeded to interfere with several other of Solomon's arrangements, with what particular object is not very apparent (vers. 17, 18). In carrying out all these changes, he had the high priest of the time for his obsequious servant. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria.</span> It was a practice of the Assyrian monarchs to hold <span class="accented">durbar's</span>, or courts, at central places in the provinces, in the course of their military expeditions, whereat to receive the subject princes of the neighborhood, who were expected to do homage, and bring with them presents, or their fixed tribute. Tiglath-pileser held one such court in the earlier part of his reign at Arpad, a Syrian town, at which were present the kings of Comma-gene, Syria, Tyre, Carchemish, Gaugama, and others. He seems to have held another at some unknown place, about  <span class="date">B.C. 732</span> (it may have been at Damascus), which was attended by the kings of Commagene, Car-chemish, Gebal, Hamath, Gaugama, Tubal, Arvad, Ammon, Moab, Askelon, Gaza, Edom, and Judah, the last-mentioned being Yahu-khazi (Jehoahaz), by which is probably meant Ahaz. It is with reason conjectured that this was the occasion mentioned in the text, when "King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser." <span class="cmt_word">And saw an altar that was at Damascus.</span> It is almost certain that this was an Assyrian altar. Ahaz may at one time have turned for help to the gods of Syria (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>), and asked their aid against his enemies; but the glory of Syria was now gone, her gods were discredited, and the place of power was occupied by Assyria, which had asserted its supremacy. When Ahaz visited Tiglath-pileser at Damascus, and "saw an altar," it was, in all probability, Tiglath-pileser's altar. The Assyrian kings were accustomed to carry altars about with them, and to have them set up in their fortified camps, or in other convenient places. They also, not infrequently, set up altars to the great gods in the countries which they conquered, and required the inhabitants to pay them reverence. Ahaz may either have been required by Tiglath-pileser to set up an Assyrian altar in the temple, or he may have volunteered the act as one which was likely to please his suzerain. <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the high priest <span class="cmt_word">- the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it.</span> Assyrian altars were quite different from Jewish ones. Generally they were of small size, either square with a battlemented edge, or round at the top and supported on a triangular base ('Dict. of the Bible,' <span class="accented">ad voc</span>. "Altar," vol. 1. p. 55, woodcuts Nos. 3 and 5). It is scarcely likely that Ahaz was particularly pleased with the pattern (Keil), and therefore wished to have one like it. He probably merely wished to satisfy his suzerain that he had conformed to some of his religious usages. <span class="cmt_word">According to all the workmanship thereof.</span> Though not very elaborate, the Assyrian altars have an ornamentation which is peculiar and unmistakable. Careful instructions would be needed for workmen who had never seen the sort of object which they were required to produce.

But Urijah was a man of a weaker fiber, and does not seem to have thought even of remonstrance, much less of resistance.

What the writer has it in his mind to record is that the king, on his return from Damascus, at once made use of the new' altar for his private sacrifices. If he had meant to tax Ahaz with so great a sin as that which brought the curse of leprosy upon Uzziah, he would almost certainly have made his meaning clearer.

Having introduced his self-invented <span class="accented">quasi-idolatrous</span> altar into the temple, and so inserted "the thin end of the wedge," Ahaz was not satisfied, but proceeded to another innovation. Urijah, having had no express order from the king with respect to the position of the new altar, had placed it in front of the old one, between it and the eastern gate of the court. Thus the old altar, which was directly in front of the temple porch, seemed to cut the new altar off from the temple. Ahaz would not have this continue, and resolved on removing the altar of Solomon from, its place, and putting it elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">From the forefront of the house</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>), <span class="cmt_word">from between the altar</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the new altar - <span class="cmt_word">and the house of the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the temple building - <span class="cmt_word">and put it on the north side of the altar.</span> The removal of Solomon's altar from its place of honor to a side position left the space clear between the temple and the new altar, which thus, without exactly occupying the same site, took practically the place of Solomon's altar.

This has been supposed to mean "in the twentieth year from the accession of Jotham," or, in other words, in the fourth year of Ahaz, since Jotham reigned only sixteen years (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-33.htm">2 Kings 15:33</a>). But now the beginning of his reign is placed eight years later. An interregnum of this duration has been placed by some between Pekah and Doshea; but this is contradicted by <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, and also by an inscription of Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123,124, lines 17, 18).

De maintained the calf-worship, leant upon "arms of flesh," and turned a deaf ear to the teaching of the prophets e.g, Hoshea and Micah, who addressed their warnings to him. But he was not guilty of any special wickedness - he set up no new idolatry; he seems to have allowed his subjects, if they pleased, to attend the festival worship at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11, 18</a>). The rabbis add that when the golden calf of Bethel had been carried off by the Assyrians in one of their incursions, he did not replace it ('Seder Olam,' <a href="../../par/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>.); but it is not at all clear that the image was carried away until Hoshea's reign was over (see Dr. Pusey's comment on Barnes' NotesHosea 10:6 in his ' Minor Prophets,' p. 64). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against him came up Shal-maneser King of Assyria.</span> Shalmaneser's succession to Tiglath-pileser on the throne of Assyria, once doubted, is now rendered certain by the Eponym Canon, which makes him ascend the throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, and cease to reign in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>. It is uncertain whether he was Tiglath-pileser's son or a usurper. The name, Shalmaneser (<span class="accented">Sali-manu-uzur</span>) was an old royal name in Assyria, and signified "Shalman protects" (compare the names Nabu-kudur-uzur, Nergal-asar-uzur, Nabu-pal-uzur, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And Hoshea became his servant.</span> Hoshea had been placed on the throne by Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123, 124, lines 17,18), and had paid him tribute (ibid., lines 18, 19). We must suppose that on Tiglath-pileser's death, in  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, he had revolted, and resumed his independence. Shalmaneser. having become king, probably came up against Hoshea in the same year, and forced him to resume his position of <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> tributary. This may have been the time when "<span class="accented">Shalman</span> spoiled Beth-Arbel in the day of battle" (Dos. 10:14), defeating Hoshea near that place (Arbela, now <span class="accented">Irbid</span>, in Galilee), and taking it. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him presents</span>; or, <span class="accented">rendered him tribute</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the margin of the Authorized Version.

Now at last the plunge was taken. An Ethiopian dynasty of some strength and vigor had possession of Egypt, and held its court during some part of the year at Memphis (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>). The king who occupied the throne was called Shabak or Shebek - a name which the Greeks represented by Sabakos or Sevechus, and the Hebrews by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>. (The original vocalization of this word was probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Seveh</span>; but in later times this vocalization was lost, and the Masorites pointed the word as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Soh</span> or So). The Assyrians knew the king as Sibakhi, and contended with him under Sargon. Hoshea now sent an embassy to this monarch's court, requesting his alliance and his support against the great Asiatic power by which the existence of all the petty states of Western Asia was threatened. Shalmaneser was at the time endeavoring to capture Tyro, and Hoshea might reasonably fear that, when Tyre was taken, his own turn would come. It is not clear how Shabak received Hoshea's overtures; but we may, perhaps, assume that it was with favor, since otherwise Hoshea would scarcely have ventured to withhold his tribute, as he seems to have done. It must have been in reliance on "the strength of Egypt" that he ventured to brave the anger of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">And brought no present</span> - or, <span class="accented">sent no tribute - <span class="cmt_word"></span>to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the King of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span> The ultimate result is mentioned at once, before the steps by which it was accomplished are related. Shalmaneser did not "summon Hoshea before his presence to listen to his explanations," and then, "as soon as he came, take him prisoner, put him in chains, and imprison him" (as Ewald thinks), but simply declared war, invaded Hoshea's country, besieged him in his capital, and ultimately, when he surrendered, consigned him to a prison, as Nebuchadnezzar afterwards did Jehoiachin (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Otherwise Hoshea's reign would have come to an end in his sixth or seventh, and not in his ninth year. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the King of Assyria</span> - rather, <span class="accented">and the King of Assyria - <span class="cmt_word"></span>came up throughout all the land</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span>, with an army that spread itself at once over the whole land, that came to conquer, not merely to strike a blow, and obtain submission, as on the former occasion (see ver. 3, and the comment) - <span class="cmt_word">and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</span> From some time in Hoshea's seventh year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9</a>) to some time in his ninth (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-10.htm">2 Kings 18:10</a>). According to the Hebrew mode of reckoning, parts of years are counted as years; and thus the siege need not have lasted much over a year, though it may have been extended to nearly three years. In either case, there was ample time for Shabak to have brought up his forces, had he been so minded; and his failure to do so, or in any way to succor his ally, showed how little reliance was to be placed on Egyptian promises (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor <i>by</i> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the ninth year of Hoshea the wing of Assyria took Samaria.</span> In  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, the ninth year of Hoshea, there seems to have been a revolution at Nineveh. The reign of Shalmaneser came to an end, and Sargon seated himself upon the throne. There have been commentators on Kings (Keil, Bahr) who have supposed that Shalmaneser and Sargon were the same person, and have even claimed that the Assyrian inscriptions support their view. But the fact is otherwise. Nothing is more certain than that, according to them, Sargon succeeded Shalmaneser IV. in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> by a revolution, and was the head of a new dynasty. He claims in his annals, among his earliest acts, the siege and capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' p. 125). It is remarkable that Scripture, while in no way connecting him with the capture, never distinctly assigns it to Shalmaneser. Here we are only told that "the King of Assyria" took it. In <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9, 10</a>, where we are distinctly told that Shalmaneser "came up against Samaria, and besieged it," the capture is expressed by the phrase, "they took it," not "he took <span class="accented">it</span>." Perhaps neither king was present in person at the siege, or, at any rate, at its termination. The city may have been taken by an Assyrian general, while Shalmaneser and Sargon were contending for the crown. In that case, the capture might be assigned to either. Sargon certainly claims it; Shalmaneser's annals have been so mutilated by his successors that we cannot tell whether he claimed it or not. The city fell in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>; and the deportation of its inhabitants at once took place. <span class="cmt_word">And carried Israel away into Assyria.</span> The inscription of Sargon above referred to mentions only the deportation, from the city of Samaria itself, of 27,290 persons. No doubt a vast number of others were carried off from the smaller towns and from the country districts. Still, the country was not left uninhabited, and Sargon assessed its tribute at the old rate ('Eponym Canon,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.). Nor was the cry of Samaria destroyed, since we hear of it subsequently more than once in the Assyrian annals. <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in Halah.</span> "Halah" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) has been supposed by some to be the old Assyrian city (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) of Calah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>), which was, down to the' time of Tiglath-pileser, the main capital; but the difference of spelling is an objection, and the Assyrians do not seem to have ever transported subject-populations to their capitals. It is moreover reasonable to suppose that Halah, Habor, Gozan, and Hara (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>) were in the same neighborhood. This last consideration points to the "Chalcitis" of Ptolemy (5. 18) as the true "Halah," since it was in the immediate vicinity of the Khabour, of Gauzanitis, and of Haran. <span class="cmt_word">And in Habor by the river of Gozan.</span> This is a mistranslation. The Hebrew runs, "And on Habor (Khabor), the river of Gozan" (so also in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>). "Habor, the river of Gozan," is undoubtedly one of the Khabours. Those who find Halah in Calah, or in Calacine (Calachene), generally prefer the eastern river which runs into the Tigris from Kurdistan a little below Jezireh. But there is no evidence that rids river bore the name in antiquity. The Western Khabour, on the other hand, was well known to the Assyrians under that appellation, and is the Aborrhas of Strabo and Procopius, the Chaboras of Pliny and Ptolemy, the Aburas of Isadore of Charax, and the Abora of Zosimus. It adjoins a district called  Chalcitis, and it drains the country of  Gauzanitis or Mygdonia. The Western Khabour is a river of Upper Mesopotamia, and runs into the Euphrates from the northeast near the site of the ancient Circesion. The tract which it drains is called Mygdonia by Strabo, Gauzanitis by Ptolemy. <span class="cmt_word">And in the cities of the Medes.</span> Media had been repeatedly invaded and ravaged by the Assyrians from the time of Vulnirari IV. (about  <span class="date">B.C. 810</span>); but the first king to conquer any portion of it, and people its cities with settlers from other parts of his dominions, was Sargon (Oppert, ' Inscriptions des Sargonides,' pp. 25, 37). We learn from the present passage that a certain number of these settlers were Israelites (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a> and Tobit 1:14).

A certain number, however, came in from a different source, being imposed upon the people by their kings. To this class belong the desertion of the temple-worship, enforced by Jeroboam (vex. 21), the setting up of the calves at Dan and Bethel (ver. 16) by the same, and the Baal and <span class="accented">Astarte</span> worship (ver. 16), introduced by Ahab.

The writer, before dismissing the subject of the Israelite kingdom, proceeds to inform us of certain results of the conquest. Having removed the bulk of the native inhabitants, the Assyrians did not allow the country to lie waste, but proceeded to replace the population which they had carried off by settlers from other localities (ver. 24). These settlers were, after a short time, incommoded by lions, which increased upon them, and diminished their numbers (ver. 25). The idea arose that the visitation was supernatural, and might be traced to the fact that the newcomers, not knowing "the manner of the God of the land," displeased him by the neglect of his rites or by the introduction of alien worship (ver. 26). A remedy for this was sought in the sending to them from Assyria one of the priests who had been carried off, from whom it was thought they might learn how "the God of the land" was to be propitiated. This was the orion of the "mixed religion" which grew up in the country. While the nations who had replaced the Israelites brought in their own superstitions, and severally worshipped their own gods (vers. 30, 31), there was a general acknowledgment of Jehovah by all of them, and a continuance of Jehovistic worship in the various high places. The nations both "feared the Lord, and served their graven images," down to the time when the writer of Kings composed his work (vers. 33-41). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria brought men from Babylon.</span> It has been supposed, in connection with <a href="../../par/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, that no colonists were introduced into the country till the time of Esarhaddon, who began to reign in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. But this, which would be intrinsically most improbable (for when did a king forego his tribute from a fertile country for forty-one years?), is contradicted by a statement of Sargon, that he placed colonists there in  <span class="date">B.C. 715</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 415). These were not necessarily the first; and, on the whole, it is probable that the re-peopling of the country begun earlier. Hamath was reduced by Sargon in  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, and punished severely. Its inhabitants were carried off, and replaced by Assyrians ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Probably some of them were at once settled in Samaria. The conquest of Babylon by Sargon was not till later. It occurred in  <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>, and was probably followed by the immediate deportation of some of its inhabitants to the same quarter. <span class="cmt_word">And from Cuthah.</span> "Cuthah," or "Cutha," was an important Babylonian city, often mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 74, 75; vol. 3. p. 35; vol. 5. pp. 93, 94, 102). Its ruins exist at the site now called Ibrahim, about fifteen miles northeast of Babylon. Sargon must have become master of it when he put down Merodach-Baladan and assumed the sovereignty of Babylonia, in  <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>. Why the later Jews called the Samaritans "Cuthaeans," rather than Sepharvites, or Avites, or Hamathites, it is impossible to determine. Possibly the Cuthaean settlers preponderated in numbers ever the others. <span class="cmt_word">And from Ava.</span> "Ava" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) is probably the same as the Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>) of <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a> and 2 Kings 19:13, and perhaps identical with the Ahava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) of Ezra (Ezra 8:15, 21). The city intended is thought to be the "Is" of Herodotus (1. 179), and the modern Hit. Hit lies upon the Euphrates, about a hundred and thirty miles above Babylon, in lat. 33&deg; 45' nearly. It is famous for its bitumen springs. <span class="cmt_word">And from Hamath</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 14:25). Hamath on the Orontes was conquered by Sargon in  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, two years after his capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Its rude inhabitants were carried off, and Assyrians were placed there. <span class="cmt_word">And from Sepharvaim.</span> It is generally allowed that "Sepharvaim" is "Sippara," the dual form being accounted for by the fact that Sippara was a double town, partly on the right and partly on the left bank of a stream derived from the Euphrates. Hence Pliny speaks of it as "oppida Hipparenorum" ('Hist. Nat.,' 6:30). The exact site, at Abu-Habba, sixteen miles southwest of Baghdad, has only recently been discovered (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1885, vol. 8. pp. 172-176). <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</span> Transplantation of nations, commenced by Tiglath-pileser, was practiced on a still larger scale by Sargon. The following summary will illustrate this point: "In all his wars Sargon largely employed the system of wholesale deportation. The Israelites were removed from Samaria, and planted partly in Gozan or Mygdonia, and partly in the cities recently taken from the Medes. Hamath and Damascus were peopled with captives from Armenia and other regions of the north. A portion of the Tibareni were carried captive to Assyria, and Assyrians were established in the Tibarenian country. Vast numbers of the inhabitants of the Zagros range were also transported to Assyria; Babylonians, Cuthaeans, Sapharrites, Arabians, and others were placed in Samaria; men from the extreme east (perhaps Media) in Ashdod. The Comukha were removed from the extreme north to Susiana, and Chaldaeans were brought from the extreme south to supply their places. Everywhere Sargon 'changed the abodes' of his subjects, his aim being, as it would seem, to weaken the stronger races by dispersion, and to destroy the spirit of the weaker ones by severing at a blow all the links which unite a patriotic people to the country it has long inhabited. The practice had not been unknown to previous monarchs; but it had never been employed by any of them so generally or on so grand a scale as it was by this king" (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 423).

We may gather from what is said here that, though new settlers had been brought into the country by the Assyrians, yet still there had been a considerable decrease in the population, which had been favorable to the lions multiplying. The new settlers, it is to be noted, were placed in the towns (ver. 24); and it is probable that many of the country districts lay waste and desolate.

The explanation of the word as "tents" or "huts of daughters," which Satisfied Selden, Calmer, Gesenius, Winer, Keil, and others, is rendered absolutely impossible by the context, which requires that the word, whatever its meaning, should be the name of a deity.

The Babylonian goddess who corresponds most nearly to the word, and is most likely to be intended, would seem to be Zirat-banit, the wife of Merodach ('Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' vol. 4. pp. 136-147). <span class="accented">Zirat-banit</span> means "the creating lady;" but the Hebrew interpreter seems to have mistaken the first element, which he confounded with <span class="accented">Zarat</span>, the Baby-Ionian for "tents," and so translated by "Succoth." The goddess Zirat-banit was certainly one of the principal deities of Babylon, and would be more likely to be selected than any ether goddess.

But the etymological resemblance of the two words is not close, and it is not at all certain that the Hamathites at any time acknowledged the Phoenician deities. The Hamathite inscriptions are in the character now known as "Hittite;" and there is reason to believe that the people were non-Semitic. This identification, therefore, must be regarded as very doubtful. Perhaps "Ashima" represents Simi, the daughter of Hadad (see Melito, 'Apologia').

We do not know what the religion of the Avites was, and need not be surprised that the names of their gods are new to us.

Not much confidence can be placed in these representations. The Babylonian gods were ordinarily figured in human forms.

It is curious that all three were the sons of wicked fathers. Hezekiah was probably, at an early age, Brought under the influence of Isaiah, who was on familiar terms with his father Ahaz (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3-16</a>), and would be likely to do all that lay in his power to turn Hezekiah from his father's evil ways, and to foster all the germs of good in his character.

He began, as we learn from Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3, 17</a>), "in the first year of his reign, the first month, and the first day," by reopening the temple, which Ahaz had shut up, removing from it all the "filthiness" which Ahaz had allowed to accumulate (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-5.htm">2 Chronicles 29:5</a>), gathering together the priests and Levites and exhorting them (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4-11</a>), restoring and renewing the vessels which Ahaz had cut in pieces (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-19.htm">2 Chronicles 29:19</a>), and then re-establishing the temple-worship with all due solemnity (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20-35</a>). He next resolved on holding a grand Passover-festival, in the second month, as it had not been possible to keep it in the first (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2, 3</a>), and invited thereto, not only his own subjects, but the Israelites of the neighboring kingdom who were not yet carried off, but were still under the rule of Hoshea (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10, 11, 18</a>). It was not until this festival was over that the removal of the high places was taken in hand. Then, in a fit of zeal, which no doubt the king encouraged, a multitude of those who had kept the feast went forth from Jerusalem, first into the cities of Judah and Benjamin, and then into several of the cities of Israel, and "brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars... and utterly destroyed them all" (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And brake the images, and cut down the groves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the grove</span>, according to the present text; but, as all the versions have the plural, Thenius thinks <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> should be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Keil and Bahr, on the contrary, would retain the singular, but understand it "collectively." That idolatry was practiced at some of the high places seems clear from this place, as well as from <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made</span> (see <a href="../../par/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). Difficulties are raised with respect to this statement. Some argue that the serpent, having served its purpose, would have been left hanging at the place where it was set up in the wilderness; others, that Moses would have destroyed it, lest the Israelites should make it an idol; others, again, that it was not likely to have lasted seven hundred years from the Exodus, even if it was brought into Palestine and taken care cf. It is supposed, therefore, that an imitation of the original serpent had been made by the Jews in the reign of Ahaz, had been called "the serpent Of Moses," and was now destroyed. But there is no sufficient reason for any of these suppositions. Considering what the serpent typified (<a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), it is not surprising that Moses should have been instructed to preserve it with the furniture of the tabernacle, or that, when once attached to that structure, it should have been preserved as a religious relic for seven hundred years. Many Egyptian figures in bronze now exist which are from three thousand to four thousand years old. The statement of the writer of Kings, that Hezekiah did now destroy "the serpent <span class="accented">that Moses had made</span>," is of more weight than a thousand speculations concerning what is likely, or not likely, to have happened. <span class="cmt_word">For unto these days the children of Israel did burn incense to it.</span> Not, certainly, "from Moses' time to Hezekiah's," but from a date left vague and undetermined to the time when Hezekiah took his religious reformation in hand. Hezekiah found the practice continuing; the writer is not concerned to say - perhaps does net know - when it began. He implies, however, that it was of long standing. Serpent-worship was widely spread in the East, and there was more excuse for directing religious regard toward this serpent than toward any other. <span class="cmt_word">And he called it Nehushtan</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was called Nehushtan</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> is a singular with indefinite subject ("one called"), equivalent to "they called," or "it was called" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29, 30</a>).

This was exactly what God required as the condition on which he would give his aid (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>), and what no previous king since the Assyrian troubles began could bring himself to do. <span class="cmt_word">So that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</span> It has been concluded from this statement that, "when the merits of the kings were summed up after the fall of the monarchy, Hezekiah was, by a deliberate judgment, put at the very top" (Stanley 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 397); but, as exactly the same words are used of Josiah in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-25.htm">2 Kings 23:25</a>, the true conclusion would seem to be rather that Hezekiah and Josiah were selected from the rest, and placed upon a par, above all the others. At first sight there may seem to be contradiction between the two passages, since absolute pre-eminence over <span class="accented">all</span> the other kings is ascribed to Hezekiah in one of them, to Josiah in the other; but the context shows that the pre-eminence is not the same in the two cases. To Hezekiah is ascribed pre-eminence in <span class="accented">trust</span>; to Josiah, pre-eminence in an exact observance of the Law: one excels in faith, the other in works; Josiah's whole life is one of activity, Hezekiah's great merit lies in his being content, in the crisis of his fate, to "stand still, and see the salvation of God."

And he prospered whithersoever he went forth; rather, <span class="accented">in all his goings - in cunctis ad quae procedebat</span> (Vulgate). Hezekiah's prosperity is enlarged upon by the writer of Chronicles, who says (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27-30</a>), "And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, add for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.... And Hezekiah prospered in all his works." Many brought presents to him to Jerusalem, and he was magnified in the sight of all the surrounding nations (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not.</span> Hezekiah's "rebellion" probably took place at the very commencement of his reign,  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, in the year that Shalmaneser ascended the throne. Most likely it consisted simply in his withholding his tribute, and neither going in person nor sending representatives to Nineveh, to congratulate the new monarch on his accession. This would be understood as an assertion of independence. That it was not at once resented must be ascribed to Shalmaneser's difficulties with Samaria and with Tyre, which were more pressing, as they lay nearer to Assyria. Before these were over, Sargon usurped the crown. There is reason to believe that he made at least one expedition against Hezekiah; but the date of it is uncertain. Rebellion met him on all sides, and had to be crushed near home before he could venture to deal with it on the remote outskirts of his empire. Meanwhile Hezekiah strengthened himself and built up a considerable power.

Sargon attacked Philistia in  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, made Gaza and the other towns subject, and committed the custody of them to tributary kings, in whom he had confidence. But opposition soon manifested itself. Sargon's creatures were expelled - Akhimiti from Ash-clod, Padi from Ekron. Hezekiah assisted in this war of independence, attacked Sargon's viceroys, and helped the cities to free themselves. About the year  <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> Sargon speaks of a league against Assyria, to which the parties were Philistia, Judaea, Edom, and Moab ('Eponym Canon,' p. 130). The Philistines, whom Hezekiah "smote," must be regarded as Assyrian partisans, whom he chastised in the interests of the national party. He did not seek conquests in Philistia for himself.

In contrast with Hezekiah's piety and consequent prosperity, the author places the disobedience (ver. 12) and consequent extinction of the sister kingdom (vers. 9-11), which Belonged to Hezekiah's earlier years, and was an event of the greatest importance to him, since it made his dominions conterminous with those of Assyria, and exposed his northern frontier to attack at any moment from the Assyrian forces. According to all probable human calculation, the fall of Samaria should have been followed <span class="accented">at once</span> by an attack on Judaea; and but for the change of dynasty, and troubles on all sides which ensued thereupon, this would naturally have taken place. As it was, Judaea was allowed a Breathing-space, during which she strengthened her power in Philistia (see the comment on the preceding verse), and otherwise prepared herself to resist attack (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8-11</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah King of Israel.</span> Hezekiah Began to reign before Hoshea had completed his third year (ver. 1).

The writer now, as is his manner, omitting as comparatively unimportant all Hezekiah's dealings with Sargon, which were without positive result, proceeds to give a brief account of Sennacherib's first expedition against him, and of its unfortunate, if not disgraceful, issue: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the capture of all the important cities except Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the submission of Hezekiah to any terms which Sennacherib chose to impose; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the purchase of peace by the payment of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold out of the treasures of the temple and of the royal palace. The narrative obtains copious illustration from the inscriptions of Sennacherib. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah did Sennacherib King of Assyria come up.</span> It is impossible to accept this note of time as genuine without rejecting altogether the authority of the Assyrian inscriptions. Sargon took Samaria in his first year,  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, and then had a reign of between seventeen and eighteen years, for fifteen of which we have his annals. He certainly did not associate Sennacherib with him on the throne, nor did the latter exercise any authority at all until  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, when, "on the 12th of Ab (July), he the throne ascended" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 67). Sennacherib places his first expedition against Hezekiah in his fourth year,  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. Thus, according to the Assyrian records, which are very ample, and of which we have the actual originals, twenty years intervened between the capture of Samaria and the attack of Sennacherib on Hezekiah; according to the present passage, compared with vers. 9, 10, eight years only intervened. No contradiction can be more absolute. It has been proposed to alter the date from "the fourteenth year" to "the twenty-sixth year; ' but it seems most probable that the original writer inserted no date, but simply said, "And Sennacherib, King of Assyria, came up," etc., just as he had said, without a date, "Pul the King of Assyria came up against the land" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>); and "against him (Hoshea) came up Shalmaneser" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>); and, with a very vague date, if it may be called a date, "In the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>. Comp. also <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1, 11</a>). Later on, a redactor - perhaps the same who inserted the whole series of synchronisms - introduced the words, "In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah," having obtained the number from <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a>, which he assumed to belong to the time of Sennacherib's attack. <span class="cmt_word">Against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.</span> Sennacherib himself says, "And of Hezekiah of Judah, who did not submit to my yoke, <span class="accented">forty-six</span> strong cities, fortresses, and smaller cities round about them without number, by the march of my troops... by the force of battering-rams, mining, and missiles, I besieged, I captured" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134, lines 6-12.

A bas-relief in the British Museum is thought to represent Sennacherib at the siege of Lachish. He is seated on a highly ornamented throne, and is engaged in receiving prisoners. The city is represented as strongly fortified, and as attacked with sealing-ladders and battering-rams. The surrender is taking place, and the captives of importance are being conducted from one of the tower-gates to the presence of the conqueror. An accompanying inscription is to the following effect: "Sennacherib, the great king, the King of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lakhisha (Lachish). I give permission for its destruction." It would seem that while Sennacherib was personally engaged in this siege, a portion of his army had invested Jerusalem, and were pressing the siege (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have offended; return from me.</span> The tone of the submission is abject. In vain had Isaiah counseled resistance, and promised deliverance if trust were placed in God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9-15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24-26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24, 25</a>). When the siege commenced, all was dismay within the walls - it was "a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>). Some of the rulers fled (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>); others gave themselves up for lost, and resolved on "a short life and a merry one" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). Hezekiah found no encouragement to resist in any of his counselors except Isaiah, and was therefore driven to despair - acknowledged himself in the wrong for rebelling, and besought Sennacherib to "return from him" - <span class="accented">i.e. in</span> retire and withdraw his troops. <span class="cmt_word">That which thou puttest on me will I bear.</span> Whatever burden Sennacherib chooses to put upon him, Hezekiah says he will bear, be it tribute, be it cession of territory, be it indignity of any sort or kind. He makes no reservation; but of course he assumes that the terms about to be offered him will be such as, according in the usages of war at the time, would be regarded as reasonable. <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah King of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span> Sennacherib says that the payment made him by Hezekiah was thirty talents of gold and <span class="accented">eight</span> hundred talents of silver ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 39, line 34). He has, perhaps, exaggerated, or he may have counted in all the silver that he carried off from the whole of Judaea; or, possibly, the payment to purchase peace was eight hundred talents, the fixed tribute three hundred. We learn from Sennacherib's inscription that, besides making this money payment, Hezekiah had to consent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a cession of territory towards the south-west, which was apportioned between Gaza, Ekron, and Ash-deal; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the surrender of an Assyrian vassal king, detained in Jerusalem; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the contribution to the harem at Nineveh of two if not more of his daughters.

To make up the "thirty talents of gold" he was now obliged to undo his own work, and strip the doors and pillars bare. Sennacherib tells us that, besides the two large sums of gold and silver, Hezekiah sent him at this time "woven cloth, scarlet,' embroidered; precious stones of large size; couches of ivory; movable thrones of ivory; skins of buffaloes; horns of buffaloes; and two kinds of woods" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 39, lines 34-37).

The Assyrian inscriptions are absolutely silent with respect to this expedition and its result - it being a fixed rule with the historiographers of Assyria to pass over without notice all defeats and disasters. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.</span> Sennacherib appears, by his great inscription, to have returned to Nineveh, with his Judaean captives (more than two hundred thousand in number) and his rich booty, towards the close of the year  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. In the following year he was called into Babylonia, where troubles had broken out, and Hezekiah, left to himself, seems to have made up his mind to revolt, and <span class="accented">to</span> have called in the assistance of Egypt (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). Sabatok was probably the nominal sovereign, but Tirhakah, who held his court at Meres, was lord paramount. An alliance was made; and hopes held out that, if Sennacherib again marched into Judaea, Hezekiah would receive effectual aid, especially in chariots and horsemen (ver. 24). Under these circumstances, Sennacherib made his second expedition, probably in  <span class="date">B.C. 699</span>. Regarding Egypt as his main enemy, and Judaea as of small account, he led his army by the ordinary route into the Philistian plain, pressing southward, while he detached a moderato force to hold Jerusalem in check, to threaten it, and, if an opportunity offered, to seize it. At the head of this force were three commanders, who seem to have borne, all of them, official titles; viz. the Tartan, or "commander-in-chief;" the Rabsaris, or "chief eunuch;" and the Rabshakeh, or "chief cupbearer." The Tartan was the highest of all the officials of the empire, and ranked next to the king. Sennacherib detached this force from Lachish, which seems to have revolted, and to have been undergoing a second siege. <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool.</span> It was, perhaps, this army which Isaiah saw in vision, advancing on Jerusalem from the pass of Michmash (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>), and "shaking its hand" at the city from the northern plateau outside the walls - the traditional "camp of the Assyrians."

His being spokesman made him appear to be the chief ambassador, and made Isaiah, in the parallel passage (36.), pass over in silence the other two. <span class="cmt_word">Speak ye now to Hezekiah.</span> It was a rude, almost an insulting commencement, to give Hezekiah no title - neither "the king," nor "King of Judah," nor even "your master," but to call him merely "Hezekiah." The same rudeness is persisted in throughout (vers. 22, 29, 30, 31, 32), and it is emphasized by the employment of some title or other, generally a lofty title, when Sennacherib is spoken cf. Sennacherib himself is less rude in his inscriptions (see the 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, line 45; 134, line 6; 136, lines 21, 15). <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the great king, the King of Assyria.</span> The "great king" - <span class="accented">sarru rabu</span> - was the ordinary title assumed by Assyrian monarchs. It passed from them to the Babylonians and the Persians. Sennacherib calls himself, on Bellino's cylinder," the great king, the powerful king, the King of Assyria, the king unrivalled, the pious monarch, the worshipper of the great gods, the protector of the just, the lover of the righteous, the noble warrior, the valiant hero, the first of all kings, the great punisher of unbelievers" (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 25). <span class="cmt_word">What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</span> We may assume that Hezekiah had, at the beginning of the year, withheld his tribute. He had certainly not gone out to meet the "great king" as he approached his territories, to do homage, and place the forces of Judah at his disposal. On the contrary, he had taken up an attitude of hostility. He had fortified his capital (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-2.htm">2 Chronicles 32:2-5</a>); he had collected arms and soldiers, and had shut himself up in Jerusalem, having made every preparation for a siege. Sennacherib inquires why he has dared to do all this - on what strength does he rely? What is the ground of his confidence? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20</a></div><div class="verse">Thou sayest, (but <i>they are but</i> vain words,) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for the war.

We must suppose that Sennacherib has either heard from his spies that Hezekiah is speaking to the people as he represents him to be speaking, or conjectures what he is likely to say. According to the writer of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7, 8</a>), what he did say was very different. He neither boasted of "counsel" nor of material "strength;" but simply said, "There be more with us than with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles." <span class="cmt_word">I have counsel and strength for the war.</span> Sennacherib imagines that Hezekiah's real trust is in the "fleshly arm" of Egypt, and in the counselors who have advised and brought about the alliance. And perhaps he is not far wrong. Hezekiah, it would seem, "halted between two opinions." He hoped for aid from Egypt; but, if it failed, then he hoped for the Divine help promised by Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</span>

Hezekiah's embassy to Egypt (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-7</a>) was known to him; and he rightly judged that Hezekiah was expecting aid from this quarter. This expectation he ridicules. What is Egypt but a "bruised reed"? The Nile bulrush (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5e5;</span>) has a goodly show; it rears itself aloft, and leeks strong and stately; but use it as a staff, lean upon it, and it snaps at once. Such is Pharaoh - nay, he is worse; he is a <span class="accented">bruised</span> reed, which can give no support at all, even for a moment. The Assyrian monarch was justified in his contempt. Egypt had never yet given any effectual support to the states attacked by Assyria Shebek gave no manner of aid to Hoshea, but allowed Samaria to be conquered in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> without making the slightest effort on her behalf. In  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span> he came to the aid of Gaza ('Eponym Canon,' p. 126), but Gaza was captured notwithstanding. In  <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> either he or Sabatok undertook the protection of Ashdod, but with the same lack of success (ibid., pp. 130, 131). "Kings of Egypt" assisted the Ascalonites against Sennacherib himself in  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>, and were again completely defeated (ibid., pp. 133, 134). Sargon calls the King of Egypt, whoso aid was invited by the Ashdedites (ibid., p. 130, line 37), "a monarch who could not save them." <span class="cmt_word">On which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> trust in Egypt will not only bring a country no advantage, but it will bring positive injury.

No doubt he thought it purely fantastical and illusory. But he was not unaware that it might inspire a determined resistance. He therefore condescended to argue against reliance on it. <span class="cmt_word">Is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away?</span> His counselors have suggested to Sennacherib a specious argument - How can Hezekiah confidently rely on the protection of the God of the land, Jehovah, when he has been employing himself for years in the destruction of this very God's high places and altars? Surely the God will not favor one who has been pulling down his places of worship! Putting out of sight the special requirements of the Jewish Law, the argument might well seem unanswerable. At any rate, it was calculated to have a certain effect on the minds of those who were attached to the high-place worship, and desired its continuance. <span class="cmt_word">And hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem.</span> A weak argument, if addressed to Jews of Jerusalem only, but likely to have weight with the country Jews, if, as is probable, they had crowded into the city when the invasion began.

It is difficult to account for Sennacherib's very exceptional boast, "Jehovah said to me. Go up against this laud." Perhaps he identifies "Jehovah" with "Asshur." Perhaps he has heard of prophecies, uttered in the name of Jehovah, by Jewish prophets, which threatened the land with desolation at the hand of the Assyrians (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1-11</a>, etc.).

Hebrew, Aramaic, and Assyrian were three cognate languages, closely allied, and very similar both in their grammatical forms and in their vocabularies, but still sufficiently different to be distinct languages, which were only intelligible to those who had learnt them. Rabshakeh had addressed the Jewish officials in Hebrew, probably as the language which they would best understand, if it were not even the only one that they would understand; not with the express "object of influencing the common people," as Bahr supposes. But the Jewish officials feared that the words uttered were influencing them. They proposed, therefore, that the further negotiations should be conducted in Aramaic, a tongue which they understood, and one which they supposed that Rabshakeh, as he knew Hebrew, would also know. Aramaic was spoken in most of the tract that lay between Assyria and Palestine, in Syria and Damascus certainly, in Upper Mesopotamia, along the line of the Euphrates, and perhaps as far as the Khabour river. <span class="cmt_word">For we understand it.</span> It is not likely that the Jews of this time generally understood Aramaic; but high officials of the court, who might have to deal with embassies and negotiate treaties, found it necessary to understand it, just as such persons in our own country have to know French. <span class="cmt_word">And talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</span> Besides the sentinels and other soldiers, there would probably be many idlers upon the wall, attracted by the unwonted spectacle of an ambassadorial <span class="accented">cortege</span>, and anxious to pick up intelligence.

Ambassadors are accredited by governments to governments, and the safe conduct granted to them is on the understanding that they will conduct themselves according to established usage. In no state of society can it have been allowable for envoys to intervene between the governors and the governed, and endeavor to stir up discontent among the latter. Yet this is what Rabshakeh did, and boasted of doing. Well might Isaiah say of such an arrogant and lawless aggressor, "He hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</span> Rabshakeh means to say that the effect of the men "sitting on the wall," and continuing the defense of the town, will be to bring them to the last extremity of hunger and thirst, when they will be forced even to consume their own excrement (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25-29</a>).

Still speaking Hebrew, and not Aramaic, he addressed himself directly to the people on the wall, soldiers and others, doing the very opposite to what he had been requested to do, and outraging all propriety. History scarcely presents any other instance of such coarse and barefaced effrontery, unless the affronts put upon a Danubian principality by the envoy of a "great Power" may be regarded as constituting a parallel. <span class="cmt_word">Hear the word of the great king, the King of Assyria.</span> It is scarcely likely that Sennacherib had anticipated his envoy's action, much less directed it, and told him exactly what he was to say.

There were but two grounds that Hezekiah could possibly put forward: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> deliverance by human means - by his own armed strength and that of his allies; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> deliverance by supernatural means - by some great manifestation of miraculous power on the part of Jehovah.

The first, however, is too absurd for argument, and he therefore takes no further notice of it; but the second he proceeds to combat, in vers. 33-35. <span class="cmt_word">For he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.</span> Correct grammar requires "out of my hand;" but Rabshakeh forgets that he is professing to report the words of Sennacherib.

If at one time he had trusted in Egypt, that trust was now quite or well-nigh gone. The tone of his exhortations was that recorded in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6-8</a>), "He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the King of Assyria, nor for all the multi-rude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him [see <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16</a>]; with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah King of Judah." <span class="cmt_word">Saying, The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria</span>. Hezekiah's was, in part, a general conviction that God would not forsake his people, who had recently turned to him, if not with absolute sincerity, yet at any rate with public confession of sin, and public acknowledgment of his mercies, and public profession of an intention to serve him; in part, probably, a special reliance on some definite prophecies of Isaiah, that the city should not be taken (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-6</a>; Isaiah 34:20-22).

The King of Assyria is no harsh lord, as he has been represented to them. He will be a kinder master than Hezekiah. Hezekiah condemns them to all the hardships of a siege; and then, if they survive it, to a wasted land, ruined homes, broken cisterns. Sennacherib, if they will but yield to him, promises them peace and prosperity, a time of quiet enjoyment in their own land, and then removal to another equally good, where they will "live and not die," be happy and not miserable. It will be observed that none but material inducements are held out to them. They are expected to barter freedom, independence, religious privileges, country, home, for the sake of creature comforts - for ease, quiet, and security. Setting aside the question whether they could count on the performance of the promises made them, it will be felt that they did well not to be tempted.

Probably he felt that, if he did, he would not be believed. The transplantations had been too numerous and too recent, the examples of Samaria, Damascus, Hamath, Ashdod, etc., were too notorious, for it to be worth his while to pretend that Judaea would have any other fate. He therefore set himself the task of persuading the Jews that transplantation had nothing about it displeasing or even disagreeable - that, in fact, they were to be envied rather than pitied for being about to experience it. The King of Assyria, in the goodness of his paternal breast, would select for them a land as nearly as possible "like their own land" - a land teeming with corn and wine and oil, full of rich arable tracts, of vineyards and of olive-grounds, which would yield them those fruits of the earth to which they were accustomed, in abundance. What security they had that these promises would be fulfilled, he did not attempt to show them; much less did he explain to them why, if they were to gain rather than lose, it was worth while transplanting them at all; how that transplanted nations lost all spirit and patriotism, sank into apathy, and gave no trouble to their masters. <span class="cmt_word">A land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8, 9</a>, which has, no doubt, affected the language of the reporter, who gives the general tenor of Rabshakeh's speech, but could not have taken down or have remembered his exact words) <span class="cmt_word">that ye may live, and not die</span> - as you win if you follow Hezekiah's advice  - <span class="cmt_word">and [therefore] hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, seeketh to persuade  - <span class="cmt_word">you, saying, The Lord will deliver us</span> (see the comment on ver. 30).

It had all the force of what appeared to them a complete induction. As far back as they could remember, they had always been contending with different tribes and nations, each and all of whom had had gods in whom they trusted, and the result had been uniform - the gods had been unequal to the task of protecting their votaries against Assyria: how could it be imagined that Jehovah would prove an exception? If he was not exactly, as Knobel calls him, "the insignificant god of an insignificant people," yet how was he better or stronger than the others - than Chemosh, or Moloch, or Rim-moll, or Baal, or Ashima, or Khaldi, or Bel, or Merodach? What had he done for the Jews hitherto? Nothing remarkable, so far as the Assyrians knew; for their memories did not reach back so far as the time of Asa and the deliverance from Zerah, much less to the conquest of Canaan or the Exodus. He had not 'saved the trans-Jordanic tribes from Tiglath-pileser, or Samaria from his successors. Was it not madness to suppose that he would save Judaea from Sennacherib? A heathen reasoner could not see, could not be expected to see, the momentous difference; that the gods of the other countries were "no gods" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>), while Jehovah was "the Lord of the whole earth."

We find it generally connected with Damascus (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>; ' Eponym Canon,' pp. 68, 126) and Hamath (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>; ' Eponym Canon,' p. 126), and may conjecture that it lay between them, either in Coele-Syria or in the Anti-Libanus.

Nothing is known of its gods. Probably Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah had rebelled in conjunction, and been re-conquered at no distant date. Sargon mentions in his annals that he besieged and took Sepharvaim (Sippara) in his twelfth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</span> There is probably some compression of the original narrative here. The meaning is, "Have they delivered their several cities, or has the god of Samaria delivered his city out of my hand?" No god had hitherto delivered any city which the Assyrians had attacked.

If, then, he had hoped to bring about a mutiny, or even to create a disturbance, he was disappointed. <span class="cmt_word">For the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</span> Hezekiah had either anticipated Rabshakeh's tactics, and given an order beforehand that no word should be uttered, or he had promptly met them by sending such an order, on learning Rabshakeh's proceedings, The latter is more probable, since such an outrageous course as that which Rabshakeh had pursued can scarcely have been expected.

The king felt that his best hope, so far as man was concerned, lay in the prophetical order. Isaiah, Hosed, Joel, Micah, and perhaps Obadiah, were the prophets of the time; but it is not clear that any of them were accessible except Isaiah. He had been Ahaz's counselor (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>), and was now certainly among the regular counselors of Hezekiah. Moreover, he was in Jerusalem, and could readily be consulted. Hezekiah, therefore, sends to him in his distress, and sends a most honorable and dignified embassy. It is his intention to treat the prophet with the utmost respect and courtesy. No doubt, at this period the prophetical order stood higher than the priestly one in general estimation; and not unworthily. If any living man could give the king sound advice under the circumstances, it was the son of Amoz. <span class="cmt_word">Covered with sackcloth.</span> Probably by the king's command.

It is also a day of "rebuke," or rather of "chastisement" - a day on which God's hand lies heavy upon us and chastises us for our sins. And it is a day, not of "blasphemy," but of "abhorrence" or of "contumely" - a day on which God contumeliously rejects his people, and allows them to be insulted by their enemies (see the comments of Keil and Bahr). <span class="cmt_word">For the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</span> A proverbial expression, probably meaning that a dangerous crisis approaches, and that the nation has no strength to carry it through the peril.

He had also curtailed Hezekiah's dominions, detaching from them various cities with their territories, and attaching them to Ashdod, Gaza, and Ekron (ibid., p. 135).

Most modern critics translate, with the LXX., "I will put a spirit within him," and understand "a spirit of cowardice," or "a despondent mood" (Thenius), or "an extraordinary impulse of Divine inspiration, which is to hurry him blindly on" (Drechsler). But the idea of our translators, that the blast (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) is external, and sent <span class="accented">upon</span> him, not put in him - that, in fact, the destruction of his army is referred to, seems defensible by such passages as <a href="../../par/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>. The prophecy was, no doubt, intentionally vague - enough for its immediate purpose, which was to comfort and strengthen Hezekiah - but not intended to gratify man's curiosity by revealing the exact mode in which God would work. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall hear a rumor</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">shall hear a hearsay</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be told something, which shall determine him on a hasty retreat. It is best, I think, to understand, not news of Tirhakah's advance (Knobel, Keil, Bahr), much less news of an insurrection in some other part of the empire (Cheyne), but information of the disaster to his army. It is no objection to this that Sennacherib was "with his army." No doubt he was.

No further communication was held with him. He had outraged all propriety by his appeal to the "men upon the wall" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-27.htm">2 Kings 18:27-35</a>); and it seems to have been thought most dignified to give him no answer at all.

Sennacherib seems to have been induced to write to Hezekiah by the fact that he could not march against him at once. A forward movement on the part of Tirhakah was reported to him (ver. 9), and he thought it necessary to meet, or at least watch it. But he must vent his anger on the rebel Judaean monarch in some way. He sends a letter, therefore, as more weighty and impressive than a mere message. He warns Hezekiah against being himself deceived by Jehovah (ver. 10); and he expands his inductive argument in proof of the irresistible might of Assyria, by an enumeration of four more recent conquests (ver. 12). Otherwise, he does little but repeat what Rabshakeh had already urged. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he heard say of Tirhakah King of Ethiopia.</span> Tirhakah was one of the most distinguished of the later Egyptian monarchs.

At the time of Sennacherib's second attack on Hezekiah (about  <span class="date">B.C. 699</span>) he was, as appears in the text, not yet King of Egypt, but only of Ethiopia.

The ordinary practice of the Assyrians was to carry off the images taken from a conquered people, and to set them up in their own country as trophies of victory (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1, 2</a>, where a similar practice is ascribed by anticipation to the Persians). But there are places in the inscriptions where the gods are said to have been "destroyed" or "burnt." It is reasonable to suppose that the images destroyed were those of wood, stone, and bronze, which had little or no intrinsic value, while the gold and silver idols were carried off to the land of the conqueror. No doubt idols of the former far outnumbered those of the latter kind, and, at each sack of a city the "gods" which it contained were mostly burnt. <span class="cmt_word">For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6, 7</a>). Wooden images (the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) were probably the earliest that were made, and, on account of their antiquity, were often especially reverenced. They were "carved, but rude, with undivided feet, and eyes indicated by a line, the face colored red, or white, or gilt. It was only later that ivory and gold plates were commonly laid over the wood, vested and decked out with ornaments" (Dollinger, 'Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 240). Stone idols were at first shapeless masses, then pillars or cones, finally imitations of the human form, varying from the rudest representations to the priceless statues of Phidias. In Assyrian times, neither the wooden nor the stone idols were possessed of any artistic beauty. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they have destroyed them.</span> "Gods" of this kind could not help themselves, much less save their devotees or the cities supposed to be under their protection.

Hezekiah insists that the idols are "no gods," are "nothing" - at any rate are mere blocks of wood and stone, shaped by human hands. But Jehovah is "the God of all the kingdoms of the earth" (ver. 15), the Maker of heaven and earth (ver. 15), the one and only God (ver. 19) - answering to his name, self-existing, all-sufficient, the groundwork of all other existence.

Hezekiah prays for a signal vengeance on Sennacherib, not for his own sake, not even for his people's sake, so much as for the vindication of God's honor among the nations of the earth - that it may be known far and wide that Jehovah is a God who can help, the real Ruler of the world, against whom earthly kings and earthly might avail nothing. Even thou only. It would not satisfy Hezekiah that Jehovah should be acknowledged as a mighty god, one of many.

The chariot-force was the main arm of the Assyrian military service - that on which most dependence was placed, and to which victory was commonly attributed. The number of chariots that could be brought into the field by the Assyrians is nowhere stated; but we find nearly four thousand hostile chariots collected to oppose an ordinary Assyrian invasion, and defeated (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 362, note 8).

In point of fact, Lebanon and Hermon unite their roots to form a barrier between the Coele-Syrian plain (<span class="accented">El Buka'a</span>) and the valley of the Jordan, and an invader from the north must cross this barrier. It is not so difficult or rugged but that the Assyrians could bring their chariots ever it. They were accustomed to traverse far more difficult regions in Zagros and Niphatos and Taurus, and to carry their chariots with them, dismounting when necessary, and having the vehicles lifted over obstacles by human hands (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74). <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon.</span> An army which invades Palestine by the Coele-Syrian valley - quite the easiest and most usual line of invasion - necessarily passes along the entire eastern "side," or "flank," of Lebanon, which is the proper meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and not "loftiest height" (Keil), or "innermost recess" (Revised Version). The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, is natural when a mountain range, like Lebanon, is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof.</span> The felling of timber in the Syrian mountain-chains was a common practice of the Assyrian invaders, and had two quite distinct objects. Sometimes it was mere cruel devastation, done to injure and impoverish the inhabitants; but more often it was done for the sake of the timber which the conqueror carried off into his own country. "The mountains of Amanus I ascended," says Asshur-nazir-pal; "wood for bridges, pines, box, cypress, I cut down... cedar-wood from Amanus I destined for Bit-Hira and my pleasure-house called Azmaku, and for the temple of the moon and sun, the exalted gods. I proceeded to the land of Iz-mehri, and took possession of it throughout: I cut down beams for bridges, and carried them to Nineveh" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 74). The cedar (<span class="accented">erez</span>) and the pine, or juniper (<span class="accented">berosh</span>), were in special request. <span class="cmt_word">And I will enter into the lodgings of his borders -</span> rather, the <span class="accented">lodge of its</span> border - perhaps a palace or hunting-lodge on the outskirt of the Lebanon forest region (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and into the forest of his Carmel</span>; rather, the <span class="accented">forest of its orchard</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the choicest part of the Lebanon forest region - the part which is rather park or orchard than mere forest.

Sennacherib means that this is what he is wont to do. As mountains do not stop him (ver. 23), so deserts do not stop him - he digs wells in them, and drinks water "strange" to the soil - never before seen there. <span class="cmt_word">And with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">will</span> 1 <span class="accented">dry up all the rivers of Egypt</span> (compare the Revised Version. "Mazor" is used for "Egypt" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a> and <a href="../../par/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). It is the old singular from which was formed the dual Mizraim. Whether it meant "land of strength" (Pusey), or "land of distress" (Ewald), may be doubted, since we have no right to assume a Hebrew derivation. There was probably a native word, from which the Hebrew <span class="accented">Mazor</span>, the Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span> were taken. Sennacherib's beast is that, as he makes deserts traversable by digging wells, so, if rivers try to stop him, he will find a way of drying them up. Compare the boasts of Alaric in Claudian ('Bell. Get.,' pp. 525-532), who had probably this passage of Kings in his thoughts - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"To patior suadente fugam, cum cesserit omnis<br />Obsequiis natura meis?<br />Subsidere nostris Sub pedibus montes, arescere vidimus amnes<br />Fregi Alpes, galeisque Padum victricibus hausi."</span>

It is no longer Sennacherib who reveals the thoughts of his own heart, but Jehovah who addresses the proud monarch. "Hast thou not heard, how from long ago I have acted thus? Hast thou never been taught that revolutions, conquests, the rise and fall of nations, are God's doing, decreed by him long, long age - ay, from the creation of the world? Art thou not aware that this is so, either from tradition, or by listening to the voice of reason within thine own heart?" It is implied that such knowledge ought to he in the possession of every man. <span class="cmt_word">And of ancient times that I have formed it?</span> A rhetorical repetition of the previous question, needful for the balance of clauses, in which Hebrew poetry delights, but adding nothing to the sense. <span class="cmt_word">Now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.</span> The idea was very familiar to Isaiah and his contemporaries. Years before, when Assyria first became threatening, Isaiah, speaking in the person of Jehovah, had exclaimed, "O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5, 6</a>). But the heathen kings whom God made his instruments to chasten sinful nations imagined that they conquered and destroyed and laid waste by their own strength (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/19-26.htm">2 Kings 19:26</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were <i>as</i> the grass of the field, and <i>as</i> the green herb, <i>as</i> the grass on the housetops, and <i>as corn</i> blasted before it be grown up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power</span>; literally, <span class="accented">were short of hand</span>  - unable, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> make an effectual resistance. When God has decreed a change in the distribution of power among the nations, his providence works doubly. It infuses confidence and strength into the aggressive people, and spreads dismay and terror among those who are attacked. Unaccountable panics seize them - they seem paralyzed; instead of making every possible preparation for resistance, they fold their hands and do nothing. They are like fascinated birds before the stealthy advance of the serpent. <span class="cmt_word">They were dismayed and confounded.</span> Historically, the prophet declares, this was the cause of the general collapse of the nations whom the Assyrians attacked. God put a craven fear into their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops.</span> The "grass of the field" is one of the most frequent similes for weakness. "All flesh is grass" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>); "They shall soon be cut down like the grass" (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>); "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>); "I am withered like grass" (<a href="../../par/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>). In the hot sun of an Eastern sky nothing faded more quickly. But this weakness was intensified in the "grass of the house-tops." It "withered before it grew up" (<a href="../../par/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). The depth of earth was so slight, the exposure so great, the heat so scorching, that it sank in death almost as soon as it had sprung to life. Such has been the weakness of the nations given over as a prey to the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_word">And as corn blasted before it be grown up.</span> Corn blasted before it shoots into a stalk is as frail as grass, or frailer. It dwindles and disappears without even asserting itself.

Jehovah claims an absolute knowledge of all that Sennacherib does or thinks, both when he is in action and when he is at rest. Nothing is hid from him (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-16</a>). Human pride should stand abashed before such absolute knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">And thy rage against me.</span> Opposition to their will fills violent men with fury and rage. Sennacherib's anger was primarily against Hezekiah, but when once he was convinced that Hezekiah really trusted in Jehovah (ver. 10), his fury would turn against God himself (see <a href="../../par/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a>, where the Lord's anointed is primarily David).

Captive kings were actually so treated by the Assyrians themselves. A hook or split-ring was thrust through the cartilage of the nose, or the fleshy part of the under lip, with a rope or thong attached to it, and in this guise they were led into the monarch's presence, to receive their final sentence at his hands. In the sculptures of Sargon at Khorsabad we see three prisoners brought before him in this fashion, one of whom he seems to be about to kill with a spear ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 367). In another sculpture set up by a Babylonian king, his vizier brings before him two captives similarly treated, but with the ring, apparently, passed through the cartilage of their noses (ibid., vol. 3. p. 436) Manasseh seems to have received the same treatment at the hands of the "captains" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>) who brought him a prisoner to Esarhaddon at Babylon. Other allusions to the practice in Scripture will be found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>. The threat in the present passage was, of course, not intended to be understood life-rally, but only as a declaration that God would bring down the pride of Sennacherib, humiliate him, and reduce him to a state of abject weakness and abasement. <span class="cmt_word">And I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest</span> (comp. ver. 33). The meaning is clear. Sennacherib would not be allowed to come near Jerusalem. He would hurry back by the low coast route (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>), by which he had made his invasion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a></div><div class="verse">And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this shall be a sign unto thee.</span> Another sudden change in the address. The prophet turns from Sennacherib to Hezekiah, and proceeds to give him a sign, and otherwise speak to him encouragingly. Signs were at the time freely offered and given by God both to the faithful and the unfaithful (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11, 14</a>). They generally consisted in the prediction of some near event, whose occurrence was to serve as a pledge, or evidence, of the probable fulfillment of another prediction of an event more distant. Such signs are not necessarily miraculous. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves.</span> The Assyrian invasion, coming early in the spring, as was usual, had prevented the Israelites from sowing their lands. But they would soon be gone, and then the Israelites could gather in such self-sown corn as they might find in the corn-lands. The next year, probably a sabbatical year, they were authorized to do the same, notwithstanding the general prohibition (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>); the third year they would return to their normal condition. The sign was not given with reference to Sennacherib's departure, which belonged to the first year, and must take place before the ingathering of the self-sown corn could begin, but with reference to the promise that Jerusalem should be free from any further attack on his part. Sennacherib reigned seventeen years longer, but led no further expedition into Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">And in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</span>

The sequel is told in a few words. That night destruction came down on the host of Sennacherib, as it lay en-camped at some distance from Jerusalem, silently and swiftly. Without noise, without disturbance, the sleeping men slept the sleep of death, and in the morning, when the survivors awoke, it was found that a hundred and eighty-five thousand were slain. Upon this, with the remnant of his army, Sennacherib hastily returned to Nineveh. There, some time after - about seventeen years according to our reckoning  - a conspiracy was formed against him by two of his sons, who murdered him as he was worshipping in a temple, and fled into Armenia. Another son, Esarhaddon, succeeded. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass that night.</span> The important expression, "that night," is omitted from the narrative of <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, but is undoubtedly an original portion of the present history. It can have no other meaning - as Keil and Bahr have seen - than "the night following the day on which Isaiah had foretold to Hezekiah the deliverance of Jerusalem." God's word "runneth very swiftly." No sooner was the premise given than the destroying angel received his orders, and "that night" the terrible stroke fell. <span class="cmt_word">That the angel of the Lord went out</span>; or, <span class="accented">an angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, LXX.). We cannot say, with Bahr, that it was "the same one who smote the firstborn in Egypt, and inflicted the pestilence after the census under David." Revelation does not tell us that there is definitely one destroying angel. "The angel of death" is a rabbinical invention. It accords rather with the analogy of God's dealings that he should use at one time the services of one minister, at another time those of another. <span class="cmt_word">And smote.</span> Imagination has been over-busy in conjecturing the exact manner of the smiting. Some critics have suggested pestilence, or more definitely "the plague" (Gesenius, Dathe, Maurer, Ewald, Winer, Thenins, Keil, etc.); others a terrible storm (Vitringa, Stanley); others the simoom (Prideaux, Milman); others a nocturnal attack by Tirhakah (Ussher, Preiss, Michaelis). Some of these the text altogether precludes, as the attack of Tirhakah, which must have aroused the whole host, and not left the disaster to be discovered by those who "awoke early in the morning." Others are improbable, as the simoom, or a terrible storm with thunder and lightning, which have never been known to accomplish such a destruction. Pestilence is no doubt possible, but a pestilence of a strange and miraculous character, to which men succumbed without awaking or disturbing others. But the narrative rather points to sudden and silent death during sleep, such as often happens to men in the course of nature singly, and here on this occasion was made to happen in one night to a hundred and eighty-five thousand men by the Divine omnipotence acting abnormally. <span class="cmt_word">In the camp of the Assyrians.</span> The destruction was not only at one time, but in one place. "The camp of the Assyrians" cannot mean half a dozen camps situated in half a dozen different places, as Keil supposes. Sennacherib was somewhere with his main army, encamped for the night, and there, wherever it was, the blow fell. But the exact locality is uncertain. All that the narrative makes clear is that it was not in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. Herodotus places the catastrophe at Pelusium (2. 141). Bahr thinks it was probably before Libnah. I should incline to place it between Libnah and the Egyptian frontier, Sennacherib, when he heard that Tirhakah was coming against him (ver. 9), having naturally marched forward to meet and engage his army. <span class="cmt_word">A hundred four score and five thousand.</span> These figures do not pretend to exactness, and can scarcely have been more than a rough estimate. They are probably the Assyrians' own estimate of their loss, which the Jews would learn from such of the fugitives as fell into their hands. <span class="cmt_word">And when they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the survivors - <span class="cmt_word">arose early in the morning, they</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hundred and eighty-five thousand  - <span class="cmt_word">were all dead corpses</span> - absolutely dead, that is; not merely sick or dying.

Sennacherib's palace and his ether buildings at Nineveh are described in his annals at some length (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 50-52). The expression, "dwelt at Nineveh," does not mean that he never quitted it, but merely implies that he dwelt there for some considerable time after his return, as he appears to have done by his annals. The Eponym Canon makes his last year  <span class="date">B.C. 682</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> - seventeen or eighteen years afterwards; not "fifty-five days" after, as the author of Tobit (1. 21) says - <span class="cmt_word">as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god.</span> The word Nisroch offers considerable difficulty. It has been connected with <span class="accented">nesher</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>), "eagle," and explained as a reference to the eagle-headed genius sometimes seen in the Assyrian sculptures ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 265). But there is no evidence that the genii were ever worshipped in Assyria, much less that they had temples of their own, nor is any name resembling "Nisroch" attached to any of them. The word itself is somewhat doubtful, and different manuscripts of the Septuagint, here and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>, have the variants of <span class="accented">Nasaraeh</span>, <span class="accented">Esorach</span>, <span class="accented">Meserach</span>, and <span class="accented">Asarach</span>, while Josephus has <span class="accented">Araskas</span>. Asarach might conceivably be a strengthened form of Asshur; but the substitution of <span class="accented">samech</span> for <span class="accented">shin</span> is against this explanation. Still, Asshur was certainly Sennacherib's favorite god, the deity whom he principally worshipped. Josephus regards the name as belonging, not to the god, but to the temple (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), which is perhaps the true solution of the difficulty. Translate - "as he was worshipping his god in the house Nisroch." <span class="cmt_word">That Adram-melech and Sharezer his sons.</span> Adram-melech is called "Adrammeles" by Aby-denus, "Ardamazanes" by Polyhistor. Neither form resembles any known Assyrian name, but <span class="accented">Adrammelech has a good</span> Semitic derivation (see the comment on 2 Kings 18:31). "Sharezer" is probably a shortened form of Nergal-shar-ozer (comp. "Shalman," <a href="../../par/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), which was a name in use at the time ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68). Abydenus seems to have called him Nergilus. <span class="cmt_word">Smote him with the sword.</span> So Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:1. &sect; 5) and Mos. Chor. ('Hist. Armen.,' 1:22). A mutilated inscription of Esarhaddon's seems to have described his war with his brothers ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 103) at the commencement of his reign, but the earlier part is wanting. <span class="cmt_word">And they escaped into the land of Armenia</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of Ararat</span>. The Hebrew "Ararat" is the Assyrian "Ur-arda" - the ordinary name for the country about Lakes Van and Urumiyeh. The name "Armenia" is not found earlier than the inscriptions of Darius Hystaspis. <span class="cmt_word">And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</span> Esarhaddon (the <span class="accented">Sarchedon</span> of Tobit 1:21, and the Asshur-akh-iddin of the Assyrian inscriptions) succeeded his father in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>, and was engaged for some time in a war with his brothers on the Upper Euphrates, after which he made himself master of Nineveh. He reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 669</span>, when he was succeeded by his son, Asshur-bani-pal.

The "Moabite Stone," discovered in 1869, throws considerable light on the character and circumstances of this rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">Moab</span> had, we know, been subjected by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>), and had been very severely treated. Either in the reign of Solomon, or more probably at his death, and the disruption of his kingdom, the Moabites had revolted, and resumed an independent position, which they had maintained until the reign of Omri. Omri, who was a warlike monarch, the greatest of the Israelite monarchs after Jeroboam, after settling himself firmly upon the throne of Israel, attacked the Moabite territory, and in a short time reduced it, making the native king, Chemosh-gad, his tributary. At the death of Omri, Ahab succeeded to the suzerainty, and maintained it during his lifetime, exacting a tribute that was felt as a severe "oppression" (Moabite Stone, line 6; comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>). The death of Ahab in battle and the defeat of his army encouraged Mesha, who had succeeded his father, Chemosh-gad, to raise the standard of revolt once more, and to emancipate his country after a period of subjection which he estimates roughly at "forty years."  The "Stone" is chiefly occupied with an account of the steps by which he recovered his territory. <span class="cmt_word">After the death of Ahab.</span> Probably, as soon as he heard of it. In Oriental empires the death of a brave and energetic monarch is constantly the signal for a general revolt of the subject peoples. They entertain a hope that his successor will not inherit his vigor and capacity.

The shutter may have been insufficiently secured; or the woodwork may have been too weak to bear his weight, Compare the fall of Eutychus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>), where, however, there is no mention of a "lattice." <span class="cmt_word">Was sick</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "was so injured that he had to take to his bed." <span class="cmt_word">Inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron.</span> As a worshipper of Baal, bent on walking in the evil way of his father and of his mother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>), Ahaziah would naturally inquire of some form of the Baal divinity. Why he chose "Baal-zebub the god of Ekron," it is impossible to say. Perhaps Baal-zebub had at the time a special reputation for giving oracular responses. Perhaps the Ekron temple was, of all the ancient sites of the Baal-worship, the one with which he could most readily communicate. Philistia lay nearer to Samaria than Phoenicia did, and of the Philistine towns Ekron (now <span class="accented">Akir</span>) was the most northern, and so the nearest. "Baal-zebub" has been thought by some to be equivalent to "Beel-samen," "the lord of heaven" - a divine title well known to the Phoenicians; but this view is etymologically unsound, since <span class="accented">zebub</span> cannot possibly mean "heaven." "Baal-zebub" is "the lord of flies " - either the god who sends them as a plague on any nation that offends him (setup. <a href="../../par/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21-31</a>), or the god who averts them from his votaries and favorites, an equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or the Roman "Jupiter Myiagrus," flies being in the East not infrequently a terrible plague.

The double negative is intensitive, and implies that the king's consultation of Baal-zebub, god of Ekron, is a complete and absolute denial of the Divinity of Jehovah. To consult a foreign oracle is equivalent to raying that the voice of God is wholly silent in one's own land. This was going further in apostasy than Ahab had gone (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6-9</a>).

He was too prominent a person in the history of the time, and too remarkable in his appearance, not to have been recognized, at any rate by some of them. But they thought it best to keep back the prophet's name, and to call him simply "a man" (<span class="accented">ish</span>) - perhaps actuated by good will towards Elijah, perhaps by a fear for their own safety, such as had been felt by Obadiah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-8.htm">1 Kings 18:8-14</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And they answered him, <i>He was</i> an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.

But the more usual explanation is that he wore a shaggy coat of untanned skin, with the hair outward. Such a garment seems certainly to have been worn by the later prophets (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and to have been regarded as a sign of their profession. But there is no positive evidence that the dress had been adopted by Isaiah's time. <span class="cmt_word">Girt with a girdle of leather.</span> Generally the Israelites wore girdles of a soft material, as linen or cotton. The "curious girdle" of the high priest's ephod was of "fine twined linen," embroidered with gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-8.htm">Exodus 28:8</a>). Girdles of leather, rough and uncomfortable, would only be worn by the very poor and by the ascetic. Elijah may have adopted his rough and coarse costume, either to show contempt for things earthly, as Hengstenberg thinks; or as a penitential garb indicating sorrow for the sins of the people, as Keil supposes; or simple to chastise and subdue the flesh, as other ascetics. <span class="cmt_word">It is Elijah the Tishbite.</span> The description given is enough. The king has no longer any doubt. His suspicion is turned into certainty. There is no living person but Elijah who would at once have the boldness to prophesy the death of the king, and would wear such a costume as described. Elijah is, of course, his enemy, as he had been his father's "enemy" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>), and will wish him ill, and prophesy accordingly, the wish being "father to the thought." It is not improbable that Elijah had withdrawn himself into obscurity on the accession of Ahaziah, or at any rate on his exhibition of strong idolatrous proclivities (Ewald), as he had done on more than one occasion from Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-8</a>). Ahaziah may have been long wishing to arrest and imprison him, and now thought he saw his opportunity.

Though not expressly mentioned in the military organization of David, they probably formed a part of it, and so passed into the institutions of the kingdom of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">With his fifty.</span> Some recognition of Elijah's superhuman power would seem to have led Ahaziah to send so large a body. His doing so was a sort of challenge to the prophet to show whether Ahaziah or the God whom he represented was the stronger. The circumstances recall those of the "band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees" (<a href="../../par/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>), which was sent, "with swords and staves," to arrest another righteous Person. <span class="cmt_word">He sat on the top of a hill</span>; literally, on <span class="accented">the top of the hill</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). The high ground where Elijah had met the messengers (ver. 3) seems to be intended. When they were gone, the prophet took his seat on the highest point, conspicuous on all sides, so avoiding any attempt at concealment, and awaiting the next step that the king would take, calmly and quietly. <span class="cmt_word">He spake unto him; Thou man of God.</span> The captain is thought by some to have spoken ironically; but there is no evidence of this. The address is respectful, submissive. The miraculous powers of Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) were probably known to the officer, who hoped by the tone of his address to escape the prophet's anger. In the same spirit he avoids issuing any command of his own, and prefers simply to deliver the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">The king hath said, Come down.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I <i>be</i> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.

But there is no need of altering the translation, Elijah undoubtedly "commanded fire to come down from heaven" (<a href="../../par/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>), or, in other words, prayed to God that it might come down, and in answer to his prayer the fire fell. The narrative may be set aside as an embellishment of later times, having no historical foundation, by those who (like Ewald) deny that miracles are possible; but, if it be accepted, it must be accepted as it stands, and Elijah must be regarded, not as having merely prophesied a result, but as having been instrumental in producing it. We must judge Elijah, not by the ideas of our own day, but by those of the age wherein he lived. He was raised up to vindicate God's honor, to check and punish idolatry, to keep alive a faithful remnant in Israel, when all the powers of the earth were leagued together to destroy and smother true religion. He was an embodiment of the Law - of absolute, strict, severe justice. The fair face of mercy was not revealed to him. Already, at Carmel, he had executed the Divine vengeance on idolaters after an exemplary fashion (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>). Now, Ahaziah, the son of the wicked Jezebel, had challenged Jehovah to a trial of strength by first ignoring him, and then sending a troop of soldiers to arrest his prophet. Was Elijah to succumb without an effort, or was he to vindicate the majesty and honor of Jehovah? He had no power of himself to do either good or harm. He could but pray to Jehovah, and Jehovah, in his wisdom and perfect goodness, would either grant or refuse his prayer. If he granted it, the punishment inflicted would not be Elijah's work, but his. To tax Elijah with cruelty is to involve God in the charge. God regarded it as a fitting time for making a signal example, and, so regarding it, he inspired a spirit of indignation in the breast of his prophet, who thereupon made the prayer which he saw fit to answer. The judgment was in accordance with the general tone and tenor of the Law, which assigns "tribulation and anguish to every soul of man that doeth evil" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9</a>), and visits with death every act of rebellion against God. <span class="cmt_word">There came down fire.</span> Josephus says that the "fire" was a flash of lightning (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>), and so the commentators generally.

The apparent discrepancy is reconciled by supposing that Jehoshaphat associated his son Jehoram in the kingdom in his seventeenth year, when he was about to enter upon the Syrian war, so that the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat was also the second year of Jehoram. It is certain that association was largely practiced in Egypt at a date long anterior to Jehoshaphat, and David's proclamation of Solomon as king was an association, so that the explanation is not untenable. On the other hand, the difficulties of the chronology of 2 Kings are so numerous and so great as to defy complete reconciliation, and to lead to a suspicion that the numbers have either suffered extensive corruption, or have been manipulated by an unskillful reviser (see Introduction, p. 3.). <span class="cmt_word">Because he had no son</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. because</span> he, Ahaziah, had no son, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Jehoram.

Mesha's war of independence consisted of a succession of sieges, whereby he recovered one by one the various strongholds in his territory, which were occupied by the Israelites - Medeba, Ataroth, Nebo, Jahaz, Horonaim, and others  - expelling the foreign garrisons, rebuilding or strengthening the fortifications, and occupying the cities by garrisons of his own. On one occasion, at the siege of Nebo, he declares that he killed seven thousand men. He found in the town a place of worship containing vessels, which he regarded as "vessels of Jehovah" (Moabite Stone, line 18); these he took? and dedicated them to Chemosh, the special god of Moab. How much of the war fell into the reign of Ahaziah, and how much into that of Jehoram his brother, is uncertain. Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the tines of Israel? Mesha's stone is a striking testimony to the <span class="accented">contemporary</span> record of historical events by the Palestinian monarchs of the time, which has sometimes been doubted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_kings/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Kings 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Kings 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm"><title>2 Kings 20 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_kings/20.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_kings/20.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_kings/20-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_kings/19.htm" title="2 Kings 19">&#9668;</a> 2 Kings 20 <a href="../2_kings/21.htm" title="2 Kings 21">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a></div><div class="verse">In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.

Ver. 6, however, shows that a time anterior to Sennacherib's discomfiture is intended; and the same verse also fixes the date to Hezekiah's fourteenth year, which was  <span class="date">B.C. 713</span>. If the date in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a> be regarded as genuine, we must consider that the illness happened in the year of Sennacherib's first expedition against Palestine; but if we regard that date as interpolated, and accept the Assyrian inscriptions as our chronological authorities, we must place the events of the present chapter twelve years earlier than that expedition, in the reign of Sargon over Assyria, and in the first reign of Merodach-Baladan over Babylon. It belongs, at any rate, to the middle part of Hezekiah's reign, while his treasures were intact (vers. 13-17), and had not been carried off to Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">Was Hezekiah sick unto death</span>; stricken, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by a malady which, in the ordinary course of nature, would have been fatal. <span class="cmt_word">And the Prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him.</span> The designation of Isaiah as "the prophet," and" the son of Amoz," as if previously unknown to the reader, indicates the original independency of the narrative, which the writer of Kings probably obtained from a separate source. <span class="cmt_word">And said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</span> The statement was a warning, not a prophecy.

Hezekiah is conscious that he has honestly endeavored to serve God, and to do his will - that, whatever may have been his shortcomings, his heart has been right towards God. He ventures, therefore, on something like expostulation. Why is he to be cut off in the midst of his days, at the age of thirty-nine, when such a wicked king as Uzziah has lived to be sixty-eight (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>), and Rehoboam to be fifty-eight (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>)? It is to be remembered that, under the old covenant, length of days was expressly promised to the righteous (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-11.htm">Proverbs 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>, etc.), and that a shortened life was the proclaimed penalty of wicked-doing (<a href="../../par/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>).

The Hebrew of Hezekiah's time had far mere reason to regard death as an evil. His hopes of a life beyond the grave were feeble - his conceptions of the life, if life there were, faint and unattractive. <span class="accented">Sheol</span>, like Hades, was a vague, awful, terrible thing. If we consider Hezekiah's words, "The grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>), we may understand how the Hebrew shrank from the fearful change. And in Hezekiah's case there was a yet further reason for grief Hezekiah had as yet no male offspring (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,'10:2. &sect; 1). Manasseh was as yet unborn (comp. ver. 6 with <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). If he died now, his house would be cut off, he would be without posterity - a sore grief to every Hebrew. Ewald's references to <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-19.htm">Isaiah 38:19</a> and Isaiah 39:7, as indicative of Hezekiah having sons at the time, are absolutely without value. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it same to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court.</span> The narrative in <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a> does not contain this touch, which is very graphic, and indicative of the eye-witness. "The middle court" is probably the second or intermediate court of the royal palace. Isaiah had not gone further than this, when he was arrested in his course by a Divine communication. <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord came to him, saying.</span> How the word of the Lord came to the prophets is an inscrutable mystery. Sometimes, no doubt, it came in vision, which to a certain extent we can understand. But how, when the prophet was secularly engaged, as in this instance, walking across a court, he knew that the thought which occurred to him was a Divine message, it is almost impossible to conceive. Still, we cannot doubt that if God determines to communicate his will to man, he must be able, with the message, to impart an absolute certainty of its source, an assured conviction that it is his word, which precludes all question, hesitation, or dubiety. Isaiah, in the middle of his walk, finds his steps arrested, anew injunction laid upon him, with a necessity of immediately obeying it.

There is not a cry, not a groan, not a tear, not a sigh of his faithful ones, to which the heart of God is not open, which does not touch him, move him, draw forth his sympathy. If he does not always grant our prayers, it is because we "ask amiss" - without faith, or without fervor, or things not good for us.

It can scarcely be supposed to have cured a malignant bell by its intrinsic force; but under the Divine blessing it was made effectual, and the cure followed. <span class="cmt_word">And they took and laid it on the boil.</span> The royal attendants obtained a lump of figs, and applied it to the inflamed boil or carbuncle, as Isaiah had suggested. It is impossible to say what exactly was the nature of the "boil," since diseases change their characters, and every age has its own special disorders; but modern medical science knows of more than one kind of pustular swelling, which, as soon as it is detected, is regarded as fatal. And he recovered. Not suddenly, but by degrees; after the manner of natural remedies. It was three days before he was well enough to quit the palace, and offer thanks in the temple for his miraculous cure (see ver. 5).

Hezekiah assumes that a near "sign" will now he granted to him, and simply asks what the sign is to be. <span class="cmt_word">And that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third day</span>? Three days would be a long and weary time to wait. It was not unnatural that Hezekiah should crave some more immediate assurance that his prayer was indeed heard. Neither God nor the prophet was angry at his request. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken.</span> Hezekiah is no more reproved for asking for a sign than was Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37, 39</a>). Ahaz, his father, had been reproved for not asking (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-13.htm">Isaiah 7:13</a>). It would be faithless now for Christians to demand signs; but in an age of miracles, when there were prophets upon the earth empowered to give signs, faithful men might request them without incurring God's displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the shadow go forward ten degrees?</span> The Hebrew text will scarcely bear this translation, which, however, seems to be required by Hezekiah's answer. Perhaps for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5da;</span>. Or go back ten degrees? literally, in both clauses, <span class="accented">ten steps</span>. There are abundant reasons for believing that the early dials consisted of a gnomon set up on the top of a flight of steps, and that time was measured by the number of steps on which the shadow of the gnomon fell (see a paper by Mr. Bosanquet, in the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1874, pp. 1-82). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/20-10.htm">2 Kings 20:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees.</span> Hezekiah views it as a comparatively easy thing for the shadow, which is already descending the steps, to accelerate its pace and rapidly descend fifteen degrees instead of slowly traversing them; and therefore accepts Isaiah's other offer. <span class="cmt_word">Nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</span> Let it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, change its direction, and having descended a certain distance, suddenly return and ascend again. This will be no "light thing," but a great marvel, which will thoroughly convince him. The thought was natural, though perhaps not strictly logical. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord.</span> Though the sign had been promised, Isaiah regarded his own intercessional prayer as not out of place, and "cried unto the Lord," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prayed with energy, that the king's wish might be accomplished. So, though we have God's promise to care for us, and keep us from want (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-30</a>), yet we must daily beseech him to "give us this day our daily bread." <span class="cmt_word">And he brought the shadow ten degrees backward.</span> How this was done, we are not told, and can therefore only conjecture. The earlier commentators imagined that the revolution of the earth upon its axis was actually reversed for a time; but this idea is now generally rejected. It is clear from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a> that the phenomenon, whatever may have been its cause, was local, "done in the land" of Judah, and not visible elsewhere. Some moderns have suggested an earthquake affecting the gnomon; some a trick on the part of Isaiah; ethers, and the generality, a very abnormal refraction of the sun's rays. An observed instance of something similar, which took place at Metz, in Lotheringia, in the year 1703, is on record. Two scientists, Professor Seyffarth and Mr. J. W. Bosanquet, think that the phenomenon was due to an eclipse, in which the upper limb of the sun was obscured temporarily. In such a case a slight recession of the shadow would certainly take place; but it would scarcely be such as to attract attention from any one but a scientific observer (Stanley, 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 537). On the whole, the most probable cause would seem to be refraction, which is accepted by Keil, Bahr, and Kay. <span class="cmt_word">By which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz</span>; literally, <span class="accented">on the steps of Ahaz</span>. Sundials were invented by the Babylonians (Herod., 2:109), and were no doubt in use at Babylon long before the time of Hezekiah. They were of various kinds, and in some of them the gnomon was made to cast its shadow upon steps. There are still two dials in India - one at Benares, known as the Manmandir, and the other at Delhi - where this is the case (see Mr. Bosanquet's paper, already quoted, plate opp. p. 35). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a></div><div class="verse">At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-19.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">embassy of Merodach-Baladan</span>. Soon after his recovery, Hezekiah received an embassy from a new quarter. Hitherto Babylon and Judaea had been isolated from one another, and had perhaps scarcely known of each other's existence. Assyria had stood between them, and Babylonia had been for the most part an Assyrian dependency. But recently Babylonia had asserted herself. In  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, on the death of Shalmaneser, a native Chaldean named Meredach-Baladan had made himself king of the country, and maintained his independence against all the efforts of Sargon to reduce him. His position, however, was precarious, and it was probably in the hope of concluding an alliance with Hezekiah also an enemy of Sargon's (see the comment on ver. 6) - that he sent his embassy. He had two excuses for it. A neighboring king might well congratulate his brother monarch on his recovery; and a Chaldean prince might well inquire into an astronomical marvel (2 Chronicles 33:31). The date of the embassy appears to have been  <span class="date">B.C. 712</span>, the year following on Hezekiah's illness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time Berodach-Baladan.</span> Isaiah gives the name more correctly as "Merodach-Baladan" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1</a>). The native form is Marduk-pal-iddin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Mere-dacha son has given." This king makes his first appearance in an inscription of Tiglath-pileser's, where he is one of many chieftains among whom Babylonia is divided. Subsequently he is mentioned as revolting from Sargon in the latter's first year,  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 29), and holding the throne of Babylon for twelve years (ibid., p. 41), when Sargon conquered him, deposed him, and took the kingdom (ibid., p. 48). This twelve-years' reign is acknowledged by Ptolemy in his Canon, but the name of the king is given as Mardoc-Empadus. On the death of Sargon, in  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, Merodach-Baladan again revolted, and reigned for six months, when he was driven out of the country by Sennacherib,  <span class="date">B.C. 704</span>. He continued, however, to give trouble even after this ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 63); and his sons and grandsons were pretenders to the Babylonian throne in the reigns of Esar-haddon and his successor, Asshur-bani-pal (see 'Ancient Monarchias,' vol. 2. pp. 469 and 490). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Baladan.</span> In the Assyrian inscriptions Merodach-Baladan is always called "the son of Yakin" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 40; vol. 9. p. 13, etc.). Yakin, however, may have been his grandfather, as Nimshi was the grandfather of Jehu, and Baladan (Bel-dash?) his father. <span class="cmt_word">King of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah.</span> Thus opening diplomatic communication. It has been almost universally felt that the object of the embassy must have been to conclude, or at any rate to pave the way for, an alliance. So Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:2. &sect; 2), Ewald, Von Gerlach, Thenius, Keil, Bahr, and others. Assyria menaced both countries, and the common danger produced naturally a mutual attraction. But it was prudent to disguise this motive. <span class="cmt_word">For he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</span> Assyria could not take umbrage at an embassy of congratulation, nor at one for scientific purposes (2 Chronicles 33:31). So these two objects were paraded.

It was a grand thing that his fame should have reached so far as Babylon, a still grander thing to be offered such an alliance. It must be remembered that he and his counselors were inclined from the first to meet Assyrian menace by calling in foreign aid (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>).

Hezekiah did not do this in mere ostentation, though he may have had a certain pride in exhibiting his wealth. His main wish, no doubt, was to make known his resources, and show that he was a valuable ally. So Oroetes acted towards Polycrates (Herod., 3:123), and Hannibal towards the Gortynians (Com. Nep., 'Vit. Hannib.,' &sect; 9). It is to be borne in mind that Hezekiah's treasures were, in  <span class="date">B.C. 712</span>, still intact, and included all that ample store which he sacrificed to save Jerusalem at the time of the first expedition of Sennacherib (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>, and comp. 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, where we find enumerated among the treasures given up, besides gold and silver, "precious carbuncles, couches of ivory, elevated thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, and weapons"). <span class="cmt_word">The silver, and the gold, and the spices.</span> Compare the description of the wealth of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>).

Hezekiah, no doubt, had many "<span class="accented">store</span> cities," as Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-6.htm">2 Chronicles 8:6</a>) and Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>) had.

The revelation was now, it would seem, for the first time made that Babylon, and not Assyria, was the true enemy which Judaea had to fear, the destined foe who would accomplish all the threats of the prophets from Moses downwards, who would destroy the holy city and the glorious temple of Solomon, and carry away the ark of the covenant, and tear the people from their homes, and bring the kingdom of David to an end, and give Jerusalem over as a prey to desolation for seventy years. Henceforth it was Babylon and not Assyria which was feared, Babylon and not Assyria whereto the prophetic gaze of Isaiah himself was directed, and which became in his later prophecies (40 - 66.) the main object of his denunciations. Considering the circumstances of the time, the prophecy is a most extraordinary one. Babylonia was at the time merely one of several kingdoms bordering on Assyria which the Assyrians threatened with destruction. From the time of Tiglath-pileser she had been continually diminishing, while Assyria had been continually increasing, in power. Tiglath-pileser had overrun the country and established himself as king there. Shalmaneser's authority had been uncontested. If just at present a native prince held the throne, it was by a very uncertain tenure, and a few years later Assyria regained complete mastery. No <span class="accented">human</span> foresight could possibly have anticipated such a complete reversal of the relative positions of the two countries as was involved in Isaiah's prophecy - a reversal which was only accomplished by the appearance on the scene of a new power, Media, which hitherto had been regarded as of the very slightest account<span class="cmt_word">.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a></div><div class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - The <span class="accented">great works of Hezekiah</span>, <span class="accented">and his</span> decease. Hezekiah was known, not only as a pious king, and the king in whose reign the pride of the Assyrians was dashed to the ground, but also as one who, by works of great importance, conferred permanent benefit on Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3-5</a> and 30; Ecclus. 48:17). The writer feels that he cannot conclude his notice of Hezekiah's reign without some mention of these works. He enters, however, into no description, but, having referred the reader for details to the "book of the chronicles," notes in the briefest possible way the decease of Hezekiah, and the accession of his son and successor. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might.</span> Hezekiah's "might" was chiefly shown in the earlier portion of his reign, when he "smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>). Against Assyria he was unsuccessful, and must have succumbed, but for the miraculous destruction of Sennacherib's host. <span class="cmt_word">And how he made a pool</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the pool</span>, or <span class="accented">the reservoir</span>. The writer of Kings either knows of one pool only in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, or regards one as so superior that it deserves to be called <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "the pool." Recent discoveries make it highly probable that the "pool" intended is that of Siloam, or, if not the present Siloam reservoir, a larger one, a little below it, now known as <span class="accented">Birket el Hamra</span> (see the 'Quarterly Statement' of the Palestine Exploration Fund for April, 1886, p. 88). That there was at least one other pool in Hezekiah's time is evident from <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9, 11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And a conduit</span>; rather, the conduit. If "the pool" is Siloam, "the conduit" must almost certainly be that which was excavated under Ophel for the purpose of conveying the water from the Well of the Virgin in the Kedron valley to the Siloam reservoir on the western side of the spur. This conduit, which is curiously twisted, has a length of 1708 feet, with a height varying from two feet to four or five, and a width of about two feet. The roof is flat, the sides perpendicular, and the floor hollowed into a groove for the more rapid passage of the water. About nineteen feet from the southern extremity, where the channel opens upon the Siloam pool, a niche has been cut in the right-hand wall in the shape of a square tablet, and smoothed to receive an inscription of six lines, the greater part of which has been recovered. The letters are of the old Hebrew or Phoenician type, and by their forms indicate a date "between the eighth and the sixth centuries" (Sayce). The inscription, so far as it is legible, appears to have run as follows: "Behold the tunnel! Now, this is the history of the tunnel. As the excavators were lifting up the pick, each towards the other, and while there were yet three cubits to be broken through... the voice of the one called to his neighbor, for there was an excess (?) of the rock on the right. Then they rose up... they struck on the west of the excavators; the excavators struck, each to meet the other, pick to pick. And the waters flowed from their outlet to the pool for a distance of a thousand cubits; and three-fourths (?) of a cubit was the height of the rock over the head of the excavation here." We learn from it that the workmen began at either end, and tunnelled through the rock until they met in the middle - a result which their previous divergences from the straight line force us to attribute more to good fortune than to engineering science. <span class="cmt_word">And brought water into the city.</span> The Well of the Virgin was without, the Pool of Siloam within, the city - the wall of the town being carried across the Tyropoeon valley from the extreme point of Ophel to the opposite hilt (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> Hezekiah's fame rested very much upon these works, as we see by what is said of him by the son of Sirach (see the comment on vers. 20, 21).

He probably fell under the influence of the "princes of Judah," who, supported by many of the priests, had maintained themselves as a party antagonistic to Isaiah during the whole of Hezekiah's reign. Hezekiah's reformation had been carried out against their wishes. They had always leant towards foreign alliances (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>) and foreign rites (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>).

It had, perhaps, been introduced among the Jews by Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). At any rate, it was from the time of Manasseh one of the favorite idolatries of the Jewish people. The stars were believed to guide the destiny of men, and astrology was cultivated as a main part, or even as the essence, of religion. Astrological tracts form an important element in the literature of the Babylonians (see' Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 153-163). The chief objects of adoration in this worship were the sun and moon, the five planets, and the signs of the zodiac.

The outer court was for the people, the inner for the priests and Levites. Manasseh desecrated the temple to the extent of setting up in each of these two courts an idolatrous altar, dedicated to the worship of the host of heaven. In the inner court his altar was a rival to the great brazen altar of Solomon (1 Kings 9:64; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), which Ahaz had for a time removed from its place in front of the porch (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-14.htm">2 Kings 16:14</a>), but which Hezekiah had most certainly reinstated.

But probably the true meaning is, "he exercised <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>," or, "had regard to the evil eye," a common superstition in the East. <span class="cmt_word">And used enchantments.</span> A use of spoils is perhaps intended, such as those by which serpents (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) were charmed (see the comment on Isaiah 47:9). <span class="cmt_word">And dealt with familiar spirits and wizards</span> - rather, <span class="accented">he placed in office necromancers</span> (literally, a <span class="accented">necromancer</span>) <span class="accented">and wizards</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gave such persons official positions at his court, instead of putting them to death, as the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>) required - <span class="cmt_word">he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he multiplied to work wickedness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he sought out every possible way; he not only restored all the different kinds of heathen sacrifices and idolatrous customs which had been in use under Ahaz, but carried his opposition to Jehovah a great deal further. As Ewald says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 208), "He endeavored to become acquainted with all the heathen religions he could find and introduce them into Judah. For this purpose he sent into the most distant lands where there was any famous cultus, and grudged no pains for his one object."

In each of the two courts he placed an idolatrous altar, whereon the people were invited to deposit their offerings; and probably in the temple building itself, perhaps in the very holy of holies, he placed that lust-exciting emblem of Astarte, which was the most horrible profanation of all true religion, turning the truth and grace of God into lasciviousness (<a href="../../par/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>).

The promises of permanence to the city and temple, and of the continued possession of the laud by the people, were, he notes, conditional; and Manasseh, by breaking through the conditions, forfeited them (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all that my servant Moses commanded them.</span> The words are not taken from any single passage, but express the general sense of numerous passages, as for example of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-25.htm">Deuteronomy 4:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28-32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-9</a>, etc.

Every petty power in the neighborhood felt itself at liberty to make incursions with Judaea at its pleasure, to plunder and ravage, and drive off cap-tires, or massacre them in cold blood, or commit, any other atrocity. Some critics regard the description of Isaiah in 2 Kings 42:22-24 as prophetic of these sufferings.

Lascivious rites were practiced. Close by the temple the unchaste <span class="accented">priestesses</span> of Venus had their habitations, and their wretched male attendants, the Galli of the classical writers, plied their trade (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>). Cruelty and oppression increased among the upper classes (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1-3</a>); the prophets were "light and treacherous persons;" the priests "polluted the sanctuary, and did violence to the Law" (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1-3</a>). "Spoiling and violence," "strife and contention;" were rife throughout the city (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>). Ewald sums up the state of things as follows: "The atmosphere of the age was poisoned from above; and the leaders of the people of every class, whose moral decline had already become a subject of lament in the preceding century, sank into an almost incredible degeneracy. The prophets, who ought to have been ever the most loyal guardians of the truth, were for the most part like dumb and greedy dogs; many of the priests allowed themselves to be seduced into offering heathen sacrifices; the judges and nobles paid little heed to the eternal right. Equivocation and hypocrisy spread among those who ought to have ministered most austerely to public truthfulness of life; while those who were engaged in commerce and trade sank into the harshest indifference to every higher aim, and thought only of the acquisition and enjoyment of wealth. So terrible was the demoralization which set in under Manasseh, that those who remained faithful to the ancient religion were either scoffed at as fools, or allowed to perish in cold contempt without any effort being made to save them, and were even derided after their death." <span class="cmt_word">And have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.</span> The moral and spiritual depravity of Judah, though it only came to a head in the time of Manasseh, had its roots in a long-distant past. As St. Stephen pointed out to the Sanhedrin (<a href="../../par/acts/7-39.htm">Acts 7:39-43</a>), it began in the wilderness with the worship of the golden calf, and went on to the worship of the host of heaven, of Moloch, and of Remphan; it was shown markedly in the terrible sin of Peer (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>); it stinted God's hand when the nations had to be driven out from Canaan (<a href="../../par/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-5</a>); it provoked God's anger greatly during the whole period of the Judges (<a href="../../par/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>); checked under David and Solomon, it broke out afresh on the accession of Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>), and showed itself, more or less, under every subsequent king, culminating at last in that fearful condition of things which has been described above (see the comment on the first clause of this verse). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much.</span> We must not understand this of his own offerings to Moloch, for these have been already put on record against him (ver. 6), and this is something additional (note the strong expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>), nor even of the multitudinous sacrifices of the same kind which were the result of his influence on the people. Some culminating horror is required, something not touched upon before, and something specially attaching to the monarch himself. These conditions are answered by supposing a bloody persecution of the faithful to be intended. Josephus declares positively that Manasseh "cruelly put to death all the righteous among the Hebrews, and did not even spare the prophets" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:3. &sect; 1). A tradition, very widely received, declared Isaiah to have been one of the victims ('Gemara Jebam.,' 4:13; 'Sanhedr.,' f. 103; Tertullian, 'De Patientia,' &sect; 14; Augustine, 'De Cir. Dei,' 18:24, etc.). Stanley says, "A reign of terror commenced against all who ventured to resist the reaction. Day by day a fresh batch of the prophetic order were ordered for execution. It seemed as if a devouring lion were let loose against them. From end to end of Jerusalem were to be seen traces of their blood. The nobles who took their part were thrown headlong from the rocky cliffs of Jerusalem" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' pt. 2. p. 492). The persecution has been compared to that of Anglicans under Mary Tudor. <span class="cmt_word">Till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another</span>  <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> "till he had filled it with blood and slaughter" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord</span> (see ver. 9).

From him we learn that, after prophetical warnings had been in vain addressed to him and to his people (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-10.htm">2 Chronicles 33:10</a>), he was visited with a Divine judgment, an Assyrian army under "captains" being sent against him, who took him prisoner, and carried him to Babylon - the city where Esarheddon, the successor of Sennacherib, and contemporary of Manasseh, ordinarily held his court. Here he remained for some considerable time "in affliction" (ver. 12), and, becoming convinced of sin and deeply penitent for his manifold transgressions, he turned to God in sincerity and truth, and being restored by the Assyrians to his kingdom, he put away the idolatrous practices and emblems which he had previously introduced, "repaired the altar of the Lord" which had gone to decay, and re-established, so far as he could, the worship of Jehovah (ver. 16). A special prophet, Hosai, seems to have chronicled his sins and his repentance in a work which survived the Captivity, and is twice quoted by the compiler of the Books of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-18.htm">2 Chronicles 33:18, 19</a>). The submission of Manasseh to Esarhaddon is noted in the latter's annals, about the year  <span class="date">B.C. 680</span> (see 'Eponym Canon,' p. 139, line 13). Other "acts" of Manasseh were the fortification of Jerusalem "on the west side of Gihon in the valley" the strengthening of the defenses of Ophel, and the occupation with strong garrisons of the various fortresses within his dominions. He thus played his part of tributary ally to Assyria With zeal, placing the south-eastern frontier in an excellent condition to resist the assaults of Egypt. Manasseh outlived Esarhaddon, and was for many years contemporary with Asshur-bani-pal, his son, whose inscriptions, however, contain no mention of him. Most likely his name occurred on Cylinder C, line 3, which is now illegible (see G. Smith's' History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 31,line c). <span class="cmt_word">And all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> The "sin which he sinned" is probably his persecution, which was viewed as his worst sin (see ver. 16; and comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house.</span> We have already seen reason for believing that the catacomb of David was full, and that Hezekiah was buried outside it, though in the neighborhood, on this account (see the comment on 2 Kings 20:21). Manasseh seems to have made a new family tomb in a garden belonging to his house (see ver. 26; and comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>). It is quite impossible to fix its site. <span class="cmt_word">In the garden of Uzza.</span> Probably an addition to the old palace garden; perhaps a purchase made by Manasseh with the object of converting it into a burial-ground. "Uzza," or "Uzzah," was a common name among the Jews (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-49.htm">Ezra 2:49</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-51.htm">Nehemiah 7:51</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-7.htm">1 Chronicles 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-11</a>), and does not point to any definite individual. <span class="cmt_word">And Amen his son reigned in his stead.</span> "Amon" in Hebrew means "Nursling," or "Darling," and it is quite possible that Manasseh gave his son the name in this sense. But it is also the ordinary Hebrew form of the term ("Amen," or "Amun") by which the Egyptians designated the great god of Thebes, whom the Greeks and Romans called "Ammon." It has therefore been thought by many that it was given by Manasseh to his son "in an idolatrous spirit." So Bishop Cotton in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 61, and others.

The writer of Kings, bent on abbreviating as much as possible, omits the early reforms of Josiah, which are related in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3-7</a>, with perhaps some anticipation of what happened later. The young king gave marked indications of personal piety and attachment to true religion as early as the eighth year of his reign, when he was sixteen, and had just attained his majority (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 232, note). Later, in his twelfth year, he began the purging of the temple and of Jerusalem, at the same time probably commencing the repairs spoken of in ver. 9. Jeremiah's prophesying, begun in the same or in the next year (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>), must have been a powerful assistance to his reformation. <span class="cmt_word">That the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the Lord, saying.</span> Shaphan held the office, which Shebna had held in the later part of Hezekiah's reign (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>), an office of much importance and dignity. According to the author of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>), there were associated with him on this occasion two other personages of importance, viz. Maaseiah, the governor of the city (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>), and Joah the son of Joahaz, the "recorder," or "remembrancer."

When Shaphan had transacted with Hilkiah the business entrusted to him by the king, Hilkiah took the opportunity of sending word by him to the king with respect to a discovery that he had recently made, during the investigations connected with the repairs. He had found a book, which he called without any doubt or hesitation, "the book of the Law" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>  - and this book he put into the hands of Shaphan, who "read it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some of it, and found it of such importance that he took it back with him to the palace, and read a portion to the king. Hereupon the king "rent his clothes," and required that special inquiry should be made of the Lord concerning the words of the book, and particularly concerning the threatenings contained in it. The persons entrusted with this task thought it best to lay the matter before Huldah, a prophetess, who lived in Jerusalem at the time, and pro-seeded to confer with her at her residence. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the Law in the house of the Lord.</span> There has been great difference of opinion as to what it was which Hilkiah had found. Ewald believes it to have been the Book of Deuteronomy, which had, he thinks, been composed some thirty or forty years before in Egypt by a Jewish exile, and had found its way, <span class="accented">by a sort of chance</span>, into Palestine, where "some <span class="accented">priest"</span> had placed a copy of it in the temple ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. pp. 233-235). Thenius suggests "a collection of the laws and ordinances of Moses, which was afterwards worked up into the Pentateuch;" Bertheau, "the three middle books of the Pentateuch, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers;" Gramberg, "Exodus by itself." But there seem to be no sufficient grounds for questioning the ancient opinion - that of Josephus, and of the Jews generally - that it was a copy of the entire Pentateuch. (So De Wette, 'Einleitung in das Alt. Test.,' &sect; 162 <span class="accented">a</span>; Keil, 'Commentary on Kings,' pp. 477, 478; Bahr, 'Commentary,' vol. 6. p. 257; and others). The words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "the <span class="accented">book</span> of the Law," are really sufficient to decide the point; since, as Keil says, they "cannot mean anything else, either grammatically or historically, than the Mosaic book of the Law (the Pentateuch), which is so designated, as is generally admitted, in the Chronicles and the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah." The same conclusion follows from the expression, "the book of the covenant" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5df;&#x5df;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>), in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>, and also from <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24, 25</a>, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>. Whether or no the copy was the actual original deposited in the ark of the covenant by Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), as Keil believes, is doubtful. As Egyptian manuscripts which are from three to four thousand years old still exist in good condition, there can be no reason why a manuscript of Moses' time should not have been found and have been legible in Josiah's. But, if not the actual handwriting of Moses, it was probably its lineal descendant - the copy made for the temple service, and kept ordinarily "in the side of the ark" - which may well have been lost in the time of Manasseh or Amen, and which was now happily "found." <span class="cmt_word">And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> We need not suppose that Shaphan read the whole. But he read enough to show him how important the work was, and how necessary it was to make it known to the king.

It was not, however, a wholly new thing; rather, he accepted it as the recovery of a thing that was known to have been lost, and was now happily found. And in accepting it he regarded it as authoritative. It was not to him "a book of Law" (Ewald), but "the book of <span class="accented">the</span> Law." We can well imagine that, although the book may have been lost early in Manasseh's reign, yet echoes of it had lingered on <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the liturgies of the Jehovistic worship; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the teachings of the prophets; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in the traditional teaching of religious families; so that the pious ear recognized its phrases as familiar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is also probable that there were external tokens about the book indicative of its character, which caused its ready acceptance.

(compare Huldah's answer in vers. 16-20, which shows what she understood the king's inquiry to be). <span class="cmt_word">For great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us.</span> Josiah recognized that Judah had done, and was still doing, exactly those things against which the threatenings of the Law were directed - bad forsaken Jehovah and gone after other gods, and made to themselves high places, and set up images, and done after the customs of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before them. He could not, therefore, doubt but that the wrath of the Lord "was kindled;" but would it blaze forth at once? <span class="cmt_word">Because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.</span> Josiah assumes that their fathers have had the book, and might have known its words, either because he conceives that it had not been very long lost, or because he regards them as having possessed other copies.

It might have been expected that the matter would have been laid before one of these two persons. Possibly, however, neither of them was at Jerusalem. Jeremiah's early home was Anathoth, and Zephaniah may have finished his course before Josiah's eighteenth year (see Pusey, <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.).

The word of the Lord comes to Huldah with the arrival of the messengers, or perhaps previous to it, and she is at once ready with her reply. It divides itself into two parts. In vers. 15-17 the inquiry made is answered - answered affirmatively, "Yes, the fiat is gone forth; it is too late to avert the sentence; the anger of the Lord is kindled, and <span class="accented">shall not be quenched</span>." After this, in vers. 18-20, a special message is sent to the king, granting him an arrest of judgment, on account of his self-humiliation and abasement. "Because his heart was tender, and he had humbled himself before Jehovah, the evil should not happen in his day." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel.</span> Huldah is the only example of a prophetess in Israel, who seems to rank on the same footing with the prophets. Miriam (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="../../par/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>), Isaiah s wife (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and Anna (<a href="../../par/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) are called "prophetesses," but in a secondary sense, as holy women, having a certain gift of song or prediction from God. Huldah has the full prophetic afflatus, and delivers God's oracles, just as Isaiah and Jeremiah do. The case is a remarkable exception to the general rule that women should "keel) silence in the Churches." <span class="cmt_word">Tell the man that sent you to me.</span> The contrast between this unceremonious phrase and that used in ver. 18 is best explained by Thenius, who says, "In the first part Huldah has only the subject-matter in mind, while in ver. 18, in the quieter flow of her words, she takes notice of the state of mind of the particular person who sent to make the inquiry."

God's threatenings against nations are for the most part conditional, and may be escaped, or at least their fulfillment may be deferred indefinitely, by repentance, as we learn from the example of Nineveh (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1-10</a>). But if a nation persists long in evil-doing, there comes a time when the sentence can be no longer averted. A real repentance has become impossible, and a mock one does but provoke God the more. For such a state of things there is "no remedy" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>), and this was the state of things reached by the Jews. God's anger against them could not be quenched.

But the contradiction is not a real one. Huldah was commissioned to assure Josiah that, though the destruction of his kingdom and the desolation of Judaea and Jerusalem, threatened in the Law, were at hand, yet they would not come in his day. He would not see the evil time. Before it came he would be "gathered to his fathers" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in Jerusalem, as his predecessors had been (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>), and not hurried off into captivity, to die in a foreign land, or given "the burial of an ass, drawn and east forth before the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). The promise given him was fulfilled. He died in battle; but he was buried in peace (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>); and the fated enemy who was to destroy Jerusalem, and carry the Jewish nation into captivity, did not make any attack upon the land until three years later, when he was departed to his rest, and the throne was occupied by Jehoiakim (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place</span>; e.g. the three sieges of Nebuchadnezzar, the destruction of the temple and city by Nebuzaradan (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>), the deportation of the bulk of the inhabitants (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and the calamities which happened to the remnant left (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a>).

Baal was, in one of his aspects, the sun; and Astarte, the goddess of the "grove" wet-ship, was, in one of her aspects, the moon. The cult of "the host of heaven," though, perhaps, derived from a different source, naturally became associated with the cults of the sun and moon. <span class="cmt_word">And he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron.</span> The Law required that idols should be burnt with fire (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>), and likewise "groves" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). It was enough to "overthrow" altars (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>) and to "break" pillars.

He would not have even the ashes of the wooden objects, or the calcined powder of the metal ones, remain even in the vicinity of the holy city, but transported them to a distance. In selecting Bethel as the place to convey them to, he was no doubt actuated by the circumstance that that village was in some sense the fount and origin of all the religious impurities which had overflowed the land. That which had proceeded from Bethel might well be taken back thither.

Thereupon they ran with the mutilated part through the city, and received from the houses which they threw them into, a woman's gear. Not chastity, but barrenness, was intended by the mutilation.

The stone itself was dedicated to Chemosh (line 3). The Moabites are spoken of as "the people of Chemosh" (lines 5, 6). Success in war comes from him, and defeat is the result of his anger. One of his designations is "Ashtar-Chemosh" (line 17), or "Chemosh, who is also Ashtar," Ashtar being the male principle corresponding to the female Astarte or Ashtoreth. <span class="cmt_word">And for Milcom.</span> Moloch was called by the Jews "Milcom," or "Malcam" - "their king" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the king of the Ammonite people, since he was the sole god whom they acknowledged (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a> compared with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The abomination of the children of Ammon</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5, 7</a>; and compare the comment on 1 Kings in the 'Pulpit Commentary,' p. 222). <span class="cmt_word">Did the king defile.</span> The manner of the defilement is stated in the next verse.

Bones of men had also the actual taint of corruption about them. The "uncleanness" of dead bodies arose first out of man's natural shrinking from death, and was then further confirmed by the horrors accompanying decay. The notion was probably coeval with death itself. It received a sanction from the Law, which made it a legal defilement to touch a corpse (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11, 16</a>), and placed under a sentence of uncleanness all that was in the tent where a man died (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14, 15</a>).

At such a national center as Bethel a temple would, of course, accompany the altar. Whether the temple and altar were in use or not at the time when Josiah destroyed them, is uncertain. The mixed race which had superseded the Israelites in the country (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24-41</a>) may have continued the worship, or may have set it aside. <span class="cmt_word">And burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder</span>.

Josiah, he says, carried out his destruction of the high places, the groves, and the images "in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the northern limit of the Holy Land, which was occupied by Naphtali and Asher. By what right Josiah exercised sovereign authority in the old kingdom of Samaria, which the Assyrians had conquered and attached to their empire, can only be conjectured. Some have supposed that the Assyrians had enlarged his sovereignty, and placed Samaria under his rule; others regard him as having transferred his allegiance to Nabopolassar, and having been made by him viceroy over Palestine. But it is, perhaps, most probable that he merely took advantage of the political commotions of the time to extend his dominion so far as it seemed safe to do so. Asshur-bani-pal, the last energetic King of Assyria, appears to have ceased to reign in Josiah's fourteenth year, when he was succeeded by a weak monarch, Asshur-ebil-ili. Great troubles now broke out. The Scythians ravaged Western Asia far and wide. Assyria was attacked by the Medea and Babylonians in combination. Under these circumstances, Josiah found himself practically independent, and began to entertain ambitious projects. He "extended his dominion from Jerusalem over Samaria" (Ewald). Assyria was too much occupied to take any notice. Baby-Ionia was in the thick of the struggle. Josiah found himself able to reunite under his own headship all the scattered portions of the old Israelite kingdom, except, perhaps, the trans-Jordanic district. He levied taxes in Samaria as freely as in Judaea (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-9.htm">2 Chronicles 33:9</a>). He reformed on the same model the religions of both countries. When finally he had to fight for his throne, he marched his army into the northern portion of Samaria, and there fought the battle which cost him his life. <span class="cmt_word">Which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger.</span> The earlier kings of Israel had simply allowed the "high places" to continue, without actively increasing or multiplying them; but Manasseh had re-established them after their destruction by Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), and Amen had probably done the same after Manasseh's tardy reformation. <span class="cmt_word">Jonah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he done in Bethel</span> (see above, ver. 15).

Possibly there were no priests at Bethel at the time, since the "calf" set up by Jeroboam had been carried off (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>) by the Assyrians. The difference between the treatment of the high-place priests in Israel and in Judah (ver. 9) clearly implies that the former were attached to the worship of false gods, while the latter were priests of Jehovah who worshipped him with superstitious and unauthorized rites and ceremonies. <span class="cmt_word">And burned men's bones upon them</span> (comp. ver. 16), <span class="cmt_word">and returned to Jerusalem.</span>

In Chronicles it occupies nineteen verses of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. We learn from Chronicles that all the rites prescribed by the Law, whether in Exodus, Leviticus, or Deuteronomy, were duly observed, and that the festival was attended, not only by the Judaeans, but by many Israelites from among the ten tribes, who still remained intermixed with the Assyrian colonists in the Samaritan country (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-17.htm">2 Chronicles 35:17, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.</span> The ordinances for the due observance of the Passover feast are contained chiefly in Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5-10</a>). They are repeated, but with much less fullness, in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>.

It is an extraordinary perversity which concludes (as do De Wette and Thenius), from this comparison of the present with former Passovers under the judges and the kings, that there had been no such former Passovers at all!

Ewald has the good sense to express his dissent from this view, and to declare the meaning of the writer to be simply that "since the time of the judges there had never been such a celebration of the Passover, in such strict accordance, that is, with the prescriptions of a sacred book as that which now took place" (see his 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 239, Eng. trans.).

Thirty years of irreligion and idolatry under Manasseh had sapped the national vigor, and made true repentance an impossibility. How weak and half-hearted must have been the return to God towards the close of Manasseh's reign, that it should have had no strength to resist Amon, a youth of twenty-two, but should have disappeared wholly on his accession! And how far from sincere must have been the present conformity to the wishes of Josiah, the professed renewal of the covenant (ver. 3), and revival of disused ceremonies (vers. 21-23)! Jeremiah searched in vain through the streets of Jerusalem to find a man that executed judgment, or sought the truth (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>). The people had "a revolting and rebellious heart; they were revolted and gone" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a>). Not only idolatry, but profligacy (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>) and injustice and oppression everywhere prevailed (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-25.htm">Jeremiah 5:25-28</a>). "From the least to the greatest of them, every one was given to covetousness" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>); even the prophets and the priests "dealt falsely" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>), The state of things was one which necessarily brought down the Divine judgment, and all that Josiah's efforts could do was a little to delay it. <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</span> Manasseh's provocations lived in their consequences.

It was punishment rendered necessary by the actual condition of the nation - the condition whereto it had been reduced by Manasseh's evil doings.

Politically, the time was a stirring one. The great invasion of Western Asia by the Scythic hordes (Herod., 1:103-106), which is alluded to by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38, 39</a>, and perhaps by <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>, probably belongs to it; as also the attack of Psamatik I. upon Philistia (Herod., 2:105), the fall of the Assyrian empire (circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 617</span>), and the destruction of Nineveh: the establishment of the independence of Babylon, and her rise to greatness; together with the transfer of power in the central part of Western Asia, from the Assyrians to the Medea. Amid the dangers which beset him, Josiah appears to have conducted himself prudently, gradually extending his power over Samaria and Galilee, without coming into hostile collision with any of the neighboring nations, until about the year  <span class="date">B.C. 609</span> or 608, when his land was invaded by Pharaoh-Nechoh, the Neku of the Egyptian monuments. Josiah felt himself called upon to resist this invasion, and, in doing so, met his death (vers. 29, 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did.</span> Josiah was reckoned a good rather than a great king. No mention is made of his "might." The writer of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>) commemorates his "kindnesses" or "his good deeds." The son of Sirach speaks of his "upright" behavior (Ecclus. 49:2). Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:4. &sect; 1) praises his "justice" and his "piety," and says (ibid., 10:4. &sect; 5) his later years were passed "in peace and opulence." <span class="cmt_word">Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-27.htm">2 Chronicles 35:27</a>).

He was one of the most enterprising of the later Egyptian kings, and appears to have made this expedition in his second or third year. The unsettled condition of Western Asia after the Scythic invasion, and the fall of the Assyrian empire, seemed to give an opportunity for Egypt to reclaim her old dominion over Syria and Mesopotamia. The "King of Assyria," against whom Pharaoh-Nechoh "went up," was probably Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar. His proper rifle was "King of Babylon," which is what Nebuchadnezzar always calls him ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 113, line 22; vol. 7. p. 71, line 6; p. 75, line 9); but the Jews not unnaturally regarded him as the inheritor of the Assyrian empire, as indeed they regarded the Persian monarchs also (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>), and therefore gave him the title of "King of Assyria." <span class="cmt_word">To the river Euphrates.</span> The author of Chronicles says that "Necho King of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish" (or "at Carehemish") "by Euphrates," which shows that his design was to penetrate into Northern Syria, where Carchemish (now <span class="accented">Jerabus</span>) was situated, with a view probably of crossing the Euphrates by the ford at Bir, or by that at Balis, into Mesopotamia. <span class="cmt_word">And King Josiah wont against him.</span> It is possible that Josiah had accepted the position of Babylonian tributary after the fall of the Assyrian kingdom, and thought himself bound to resist an attack upon his suzerain. Or he may simply have resented the violation of his territory, without his permission, by a foreign army. Certainly, if he had allowed the free passage of the Egyptian troops, backwards and forwards, through his country, he would in a short time have lost even the shadow of independence. Nechoh's assurance that his expedition was not against him (Josiah), but against the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>), was not a thing to be relied upon, any more than his declaration that God had commanded his expedition. <span class="cmt_word">And he slew him at Megiddo, when he had soon him.</span> Megiddo is, beyond all doubt, the present <span class="accented">El-Ledjun</span> on the northern outskirt of the range of hills which separates the Plain of Esdraelon from that of Sharon. It is certainly surprising to find that Josiah had taken up a position so far to the north, leaving Jerusalem, and, indeed, all Judaea, unprotected. But he may have thought the advantages of the position such as to compensate for any risk to the Judaean cities, in which he would, of course, have left garrisons. Or, possibly, as Keil and Bahr suppose, Nechoh may have conveyed his troops to the Syrian coast by sea, and have landed in the Bay of Acre, close to the Plain of Esdraelon. In this case Josiah would have no choice, but, if he opposed the Egyptian monarch at all, must have met him where he did, in the Esdraelon plain, as he entered it from the Plain of Acre.

We learn from Chronicles that a great lamentation was made for Josiah, the only King of Judah slain in battle, the last good king of David's line, the pious prince whose piety had not sufficed to avert the anger of Jehovah. Jeremiah "lamented for him" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>), perhaps in a set composition (Josephus, ' Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 1); though that composition is certainly not either the Book of Lamentations or the fourth chapter of that book. He was further mourned by "all the singing men and the singing women" (2 Chronicles, <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), who "spake of him in their lamentations, and "made them an ordinance in Israel," and entered these "lamentations," apparently in a book, which was called 'The Book of Lamentations,' or 'of Dirges.' <span class="cmt_word">And the people of the laud took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah.</span> Jehoahaz was otherwise named "Shallum" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>).

Pharaoh-Nechoh, having defeated Josiah, left Jerusalem and Judaea behind him, while he pressed forward on his original enterprise (see ver. 29) into Northern Syria and the district about Carehemish, or the tract north-east of Aleppo. It was three months before he had completed his conquests in these quarters, and, having arranged matters to his satisfaction, set out on his return to Egypt. During these three months Jehoahaz bore rule at Jerusalem (ver. 31), and "did evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 32). Ezekiel compares him to "a young lion," which "learned to catch the prey, and devoured men" (Ezekiel 19:3). It may be suspected that he re-established the idolatries which Josiah had put down; but this is uncertain. Pharaoh-Nechoh, on his return from Carehemish, learning what the Jews had done, sent envoys to Jerusalem, and summoned Jehoahaz to his presence at Riblah, in the territory of Hamath (ver. 33; comp. Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 2). Je-hoahaz obeyed the summons; and Nechoh, having obtained possession of his person, "put him in bands," and carried him off to Egypt, where he died (ver. 34; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>; Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign.</span> He was, therefore, younger than his brother Eliakim, who, three months later, was "twenty-five years old" (ver. 36).

It commanded a ford over the river (Condor, 'Heth and Moab,' p. 17), and is in the midst of a rich, corn-producing country. Hamath, to which it was regarded as belonging, is situated more than fifty miles further down the river. Riblah was well placed as a center for communication with the neighboring countries. As Dr. Robinson says ('Researches,' vol. 3. p. 545), "From this point the roads were open by Aleppo and the Euphrates to Nineveh, or by Palmyra (Tadmor) to Babylon, by the end of Lebanon and the coast to Palestine (Philistia) and Egypt, or through the, Buka'a and the Jordan valley to the center of the Holy Land." Nebuchadnezzar followed the example of Nechoh in making Ribiah his headquarters during his sieges of Tyro and Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Hamath.</span> The "land of Hamath" was the upper part of the Coele-Syrian valley from about lat. 34&deg; to lat. 35&deg; 30' N. <span class="cmt_word">That he might not reign in Jerusalem.</span> Nechoh might naturally distrust the people's choice.

Pharaoh-Nechoh, when he deposed Jehoahaz, at once supplied his place by another king.

His choice fell on Josiah's eldest surviving son (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>), Eliakim, who was the natural successor of his father. Eliakim, on ascending the throne, changed his name, as Jehoahaz appears to have done (see the comment on ver. 31), and reigned as Jehoiakim. For three years (B.C. 608-605) he continued a submissive vassal of the Egyptian monarch, and remitted him his tribute regularly (ver. 36). But his rule was in all respects an evil one. He "did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 37). He leant towards idolatry (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-8.htm">2 Chronicles 36:8</a>); he was oppressive and irreligious (Josephus, 'Ant.

He made the change as slight as possible, merely substituting "Jehovah" for "El" as the initial element. The sense of the name remained the same, "God will set up."

The tyranny which he practiced was likewise of an Egyptian cast, including, as it did, the exaction of forced labor from his subjects (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>), an old custom of the Pharaohs, and it is quite possible that his "passion for building splendid and costly houses" (Ewald) was awakened by his knowledge of the magnificence which characterized the monarchs of the Saitic dynasty, who revived in Egypt the architectural glories of the Ramessides (see Herod., 2:153, 175, 176). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

It was borne by three distinct kings of Babylon, the most important of whom was Nebuchadnezzar III., the son of Nabopolassar, the monarch of the present passage. According to Berosus, he was not at the time of this expedition the actual sovereign of Babylonia, but only the crown prince, placed by the actual king, Nabopolassar, at the head of his army. It is possible that his father may have associated him in the kingdom, for association was not unknown at Babylon; or the Jews may have mistaken his position; or the historian may call him king by <span class="accented">prolepsis</span>, as a modern might say, "The Emperor Napoleon invaded Italy and defeated the Austrians at Marengo" (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 400). His father had grown too old and infirm to conduct a military expedition, and consequently sent his son in his place, with the object of chastising Nechoh, and recovering the territory whereof Nechoh had made himself master three years before (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-33</a>, and compare below, ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiakim became his servant</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> submitted to him, and became a tributary king - <span class="cmt_word">three years</span> (from  <span class="date">B.C. 605</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 602</span>): <span class="cmt_word">then he turned and rebelled against him.</span> How Jehoiakim came to venture on this step we are not told, and can only conjecture. It is, perhaps, most probable that (as Josephus says, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:6, &sect; 2) he was incited to take this course by the Egyptians, who were still under the rule of the brave and enterprising Nechoh, and who may have hoped to wipe out by fresh victories the disaster experienced at Carehemish. There is, perhaps, an allusion to Jehoiakim's expectation of Egyptian succors in the statement of ver. 7, that "the King of Egypt came not again any more out of his land."

As W. G. Sumner well observes, "The sins of Manasseh had become a designation for a certain class of offences, and a particular form of public and social depravity, which was introduced by Manassseh, but of which generation after generation continued to be guilty."

But from the biblical notices we can only gather that he died prematurely after a reign of no more than eleven years ( <span class="date">B.C. 608</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 597</span>), and was u-lamented, "buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). Conjecture has filled up the blanks of this history in several ways, the most purely imaginative being, perhaps, that of Ewald, who says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 262), "When the Chaldean armies presented themselves at the gates of the capital, Jehoiakim seems to have been betrayed into the same error as his brother (Jehoahaz), eleven years before. He gave ear to a crafty invitation of the enemy to repair for negotiations to their camp, where, in sight of his own city, he was made prisoner. He offered a frantic resistance, and was dragged away in a scuffle, and miserably cut down; while even an honorable burial for his corpse, which his family certainly solicited, was refused."

Jehoiachin has in Scripture the two other names of Jeconiah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-20.htm">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>) and Coniah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>). Jehoiachin and Jeconiah differ only, as Jehoahaz and Ahaziah, by a reversal of the order of the two elements. Both mean "Jehovah will establish (him)." "Conlah" cuts off from "Jeconiah" the sign of futurity, and means "Jehovah establishes." It is used only by Jeremiah, and seems used by him to signify that though "Jehovah establishes," Jeconiah he would <span class="accented">not</span> establish.

The short reign of Jehoisshin is now described. It lasted but three months. For some reason which is unrecorded, Nebuchadnezzar, who had placed him on the throne, took offence at his conduct, and sent an army against him to effect his deposition. Jehoiachin offered scarcely any resistance. He "went out" of the city (ver. 12), with the queen-mother, the officers of the court, and the princes, and submitted himself to the will of the great king. But he gained nothing by his pusillanimity. The Babylonians entered Jerusalem, plundered the temple and the royal palace, made prisoners of the king, his mother, the princes and nobles, the armed garrison, and all the more skilled artisans, to the number altogether of ten thousand souls (Josephus says 10,832, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 1), and carried them captive to Babylon.

His daughter, Nehushta - the Noste of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) - was probably the ruling spirit of the time during her son's short reign. We find mention of her in Jeremiah 26:26; 29:2; and in Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3, and Jeremiah 10:7. &sect; 1. Ewald suggests that she "energetically supported" her son in the policy whereby he offended Nebuchadnezzar.

The present passage probably does not mean more than that he made no attempt at a religious reformation, but allowed the idolatries and superstitions which had prevailed under Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim to continue.

Nebuchadnezzar found a son of Josiah, named Mattaniah, still surviving at Jerusalem. At his father's death he must have been a boy of ten, but he was now, eleven years later, of the age of twenty-one. This youth, only three years older than his nephew Jehoiachin, he appointed king, at the same time requiring him to change his name, which he did from "Mattaniah" to "Zedekiah" (ver. 17). Zedekiah pursued nearly the same course of action as the other recent kings. He showed no religious zeal, instituted no reform, but allowed the idolatrous practices, to which the people were so addicted, to continue (ver. 19). Though less irreligious and less inclined to persecute than Jehoiakim, he could not bring himself to turn to God. He was weak and vacillating, inclined to follow the counsels of Jeremiah, but afraid of the "princes," and ultimately took their advice, which was to ally himself with Egypt, and openly rebel against Nebuchadnezzar. This course of conduct brought about the destruction of the nation (ver. 29). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead.</span> Josiah had four sons (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>) - Johanan, the eldest, who probably died before his father; Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, the second, who was twenty-five years old at his father's death (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>); Jehoahaz, the third, otherwise called Shallum (1 Chronicles, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>), who, when his father died, was aged twenty-three (2 Kings 32:31); and Mattaniah, the youngest, who must have been then aged ten or nine. It was this fourth son, now grown to manhood, whom Nebuchadnezzar appointed king in Jehoiachin's room. <span class="cmt_word">And changed his name to Zedekiah.</span> (On the practice of changing a king's name on his accession, see the comment upon <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 34</a>.) Mat-lab means "Gift of Jehovah;" Zedekiah, "Righteousness of Jehovah." Josiah had called his son the first of these names in humble acknowledgment of God's mercy in granting him a fourth son. So other pious Jews called their sons "Nathaniel," and Greeks "Theodotus" or "Theodorus," and Romans "Deodatua." Mattaniah, in taking the second of the names, may have had in his mind the prophecy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-8</a>, where blessings are promised to the reign of a king whose name should be "<span class="accented">Jehovah-Tsidkenu</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The Lord our Righteousness." Or he may simply have intended to declare that "the righteousness of Jehovah" was what he aimed at establishing. In this case it can only be said that it would have been happy for his country, had his professions been corroborated by his acts.

Zedekiah, when he received his investiture at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar (ver. 17), took a solemn oath of allegiance and fidelity (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>) to him and to his successors; but almost immediately afterwards he began to intrigue with Egypt, sent a contingent of troops to help Psamatik II. in his wars (Wiediemann, 'Geschichte AEgyptens,' p. 159), and thus sought to pave the way for an Egyptian alliance, on the strength of which he might venture upon a revolt. It was probably owing to the suspicions which these acts aroused that, in the fourth year of his reign,  <span class="date">B.C. 594</span>, he had to visit Babylon (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>), where, no doubt, he renewed his engagements and assured the Babylonian monarch of his fidelity. But these proceedings were nothing but a blind. On the accession of Hophra (Apries) to the throne of Egypt in  <span class="date">B.C. 591</span>, Zedekiah renewed his application to the Egyptian court, openly sending ambassadors (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>), with a request for infantry and cavalry. Thus was his rebellion complete, his "oath despised," and his "covenant broken" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15, 16</a>).

The towers used in sieges by the Assyrians and Babylonians were movable ones, made of planks, which were pushed up to the walls, so that the assailants might attack their adversaries, on a level, with greater advantage. Sometimes they contained battering rams (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 19; and setup. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.

The writer omits all the details of the siege, and hastens to the final catastrophe. From Jeremiah and Ezekiel we learn that, after the siege had continued a certain time, the Egyptian monarch, Hophra or Apries, made an effort to carry out the terms of his agreement with Zedekiah, and marched an army into Southern Judaea, with the view of raising the siege (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). Nebuchadnezzar hastened to meet him. With the whole or the greater part of his host he marched southward and offered battle to the Egyptians. Whether an engagement took place or not is uncertain. Josephus affirms it, and says that Apries was "defeated and driven out of Syria" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 3). The silence of Jeremiah is thought to throw doubt on his assertion. At any rate, the Egyptians retired (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>) and took no further part in the struggle. The Babylonians returned, and the siege recommenced. A complete blockade was established, and the defenders of the city soon began to suffer from famine (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12, 20</a>). Ere long, as so often happens in sieges, famine was followed by pestilence (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-6.htm">Jeremiah 21:6, 7</a>; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), and after a time the place was reduced to the last extremity (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-9</a>). Bread was no longer to be had, and mothers devoured their children (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>). At length a breach was effected in the defenses; the enemy poured in; and the city fell (see the comment on ver. 4).

(<span class="cmt_word">Now the Chaldees were against the city round about.</span>) The town, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">was</span> guarded on all sides by Chaldean troops, so that Zedekiah and his soldiers must either have attacked the line of guard, and broken through it, or have slipped between two of the blockading pests under cover of the darkness.

The commanders at Jerusalem would fuel this the more sensibly, since Nebuchadnezzar had for some time retired from the siege, and left its conduct to them, while he himself exercised a general superintendence over military affairs from Riblah (see ver. 6). They were liable to be held responsible for the escape. <span class="cmt_word">And overtook him in the plains of Jericho.</span> The "plains of Jericho" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>) is the fertile tract on the right bank of the Jordan near its embouchure, which was excellently watered, and cultivated in gardens, orchards, and palm-groves.

This seems to be mentioned in order to account for there being no engagement. Perhaps, thinking themselves in security, and imagining that they were not followed, the troops had dispersed themselves among the farmhouses and homesteads, to obtain a much-needed refreshment.

The Egyptian and Persian artists also represent it. To Riblah. (For the situation of Riblah, see the comment on 2 Kings 23:33.) As Nebuchadnezzar was engaged at one and the same time in directing the sieges both of Tyro and of Jerusalem, it was a most convenient position for him to occupy. <span class="cmt_word">And they gave judgment upon him.</span> As a rebel, who had broken his covenant and his oath (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16, 18</a>), Zedekiah was brought to trial before Nebuchadnezzar and his great lords. The facts could not be denied, and sentence was therefore passed upon him, nominally by the court, practically by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). By an unusual act of clemency, his life was spared; but the judgment was still sufficiently severe (see the next verse).

As Zedekiah was no more than thirty-two years of age (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), his sons must have been minors, who could not justly be held responsible for their father's doings. It was usual, however, in the East, and even among the Jews, to punish children for the sins of their fathers (see <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And put out the eyes of Zedekiah.</span> This, too, was a common Oriental practice. The Philistines blinded Samson (<a href="../../par/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). Sargon, in one of his sculptures, seems to be blinding a prisoner with a spear (Botta, 'Monumens de Ninive,' pl. 18). The ancient Persians often blinded criminals (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:9. &sect; 13; Ammian. Mare., 27:12; Procop., 'De Bell. Pers.,' 1:11. p. 80). In modern Persia, it was, until very lately, usual for a king, on his accession, to blind all his brothers, in order that they might be disqualified from reigning. The operation was commonly performed in Persia by means of a red-hot iron rod (see Herod., 7:18). Zedekiah's loss of eyesight reconciled the two apparently conflicting prophecies - that he would be carried captive to Babylon (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>, etc.), and that he would never see it (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>) - in a remarkable manner. <span class="cmt_word">And bound him with fetters of brass</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with a pair of brazen fetters</span>.

Neither the Assyrians nor the Babylonians had any regard for the gods of other nations. They everywhere burnt the temples, plundered the shrines, and carried off the images as trophies of victory. In the temple of Jerusalem they would find no images except those of the two cherubim (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-28</a>), which they probably took away with them. <span class="cmt_word">And the king's house</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1, 8-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>). The royal palace was, perhaps, almost as magnificent as the temple; and its destruction was almost as great a loss to art. It doubtless contained Solomon's throne of ivory (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>), to which there was an ascent by six steps, with two sculptured lions on each step. <span class="cmt_word">And all the houses of Jerusalem.</span> This statement is qualified by the words of the following clause, which show that only the houses of the princes and great men were purposely set on fire.

The line of demarcation was, in a general way, a social one. The rich and well-to-do he would take with him; the poor and insignificant he would leave behind (vers. 11, 12). Among the former were included the high priest, the "second priest," three of the temple Levites, the commandant of the city, a certain number of the royal councilors, the "principal scribe of the host," and sixty of the "princes" (vers. 18, 19). The latter were chiefly persons of the agricultural class, who were left to be "vinedressers and husbandmen." From the temple, which had been already plundered twice (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-7.htm">2 Chronicles 36:7, 10</a>), he carried off such vessels in gold and silver and bronze as were still remaining there, together with the bronze of the two pillars Jachin and Boaz, of the great laver, or "molten sea," and of the stands for the smaller layers, all of which he broke up (ver. 13).

The Assyrian sculptures show us prisoners of war impaled on crosses, beheaded, beaten on the head with maces, and sometimes extended on the ground and flayed. The inscriptions speak of hundreds as thus executed, and mention others as burnt in furnaces, or thrown to wild beasts, or cruelly mutilated. Herodotus says (3. 159) that Darius Hystaspis crucified three thousand prisoners round about Babylon after one of its revolts. That monarch himself, in the Behistun inscription, speaks of many cases where, after capturing rebel chiefs in the field or behind walls, he executed them and their principal adherents (see <a href="../../par/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>. Par. 13; <a href="../../par/colossians/3.htm">Colossians 3</a>. Par. 8, 11).

Nebuchadnezzar, when he carried off Zedekiah to Babylon, appointed, as governor of Judaea, a certain Gedaliah, a Jew of good position, but not of the royal family. Gedaliah made Mizpah, near Jerusalem, his residence; and here he was shortly joined by a number of Jews of importance, who had escaped from Jerusalem and hidden themselves until the Babylonians were gone. Of these the most eminent were Johanan the son of Karcah, and Ishmael, a member of the royal house of David. Gedaliah urged the refugees to be good subjects of the King of Babylon, and to settle themselves to agricultural pursuits. His advice was accepted and at first followed; but presently a warning was given to Gedaliah by Johanan that Ishmael designed his destruction; and soon afterwards, as Gedaliah took no precautions, the murder was actually carried out. Other atrocities followed; but after a time Johanan and the other leading refugees took up arms, forced Ishmael to fly to the Ammonites, and then, fearing that Nebuchadnezzar would hold them responsible for Ishmael's act, against Jeremiah's remonstrances, fled, with the great mass of the Jews that had been left in the land, from Judaea into Egypt.

Nebuchadnezzar's choice of Gedaliah for governor was probably made from some knowledge of his having sided with Jeremiah, whose persistent endeavors to make the Jews submit to the Babylonian yoke seem to have been well known, not only to the Jews, but to the Babylonians; most likely by reason of the letter he sent to his countrymen already in captivity (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Shaphan, ruler.</span> Probably not "Shaphan the scribe" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3, 12</a>), but an unknown person of the same name.

He therefore gathered together the people, and made a preliminary retreat to Chimham, near Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>), on the road to Egypt, whence he subsequently, against the earnest remonstrances and prophetic warnings of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9-22</a>, carried them on into Egypt itself (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-7</a>).

This alleviation of their king's condition could not but be felt by the captive Jews as a happy omen - a portent of the time when their lot too would be alleviated, and the Almighty Disposer of events, having punished them sufficiently for their sins, would relent at last, and put an end to their banishment, and give them rest and peace in their native country. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin King of Judah.</span> According to Berosus and the Canon of Ptolemy, Nebuchadnezzar reigned forty-four years. He carried off Jehoiachin to Babylon in his eighth year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>), and thus the year of his death would exactly coincide with the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of the Jewish prince. <span class="cmt_word">In the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month.</span> The <span class="accented">five</span> and twentieth day, according to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>, (On the rarity of such exact dates in the historical Scriptures, see the comment on ver. 1.) <span class="cmt_word">That Evil-Merodach King of Babylon.</span> The native name, which is thus expressed, seems to have been "Avil-Marduk." The meaning of <span class="accented">avil</span> is uncertain; but the name probably placed the prince under the protection of Merodach, who was Nebuchadnezzar's favorite god. Avil-Marduk ascended the Babylonian throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, and reigned two years only, when he was murdered by Neriglissar, or Nergal-sar-uzur, his brother-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">In the year that he began to reign</span> - the year  <span class="date">B.C. 561</span> - <span class="cmt_word">did lift up the head of Jehoiachin King of Judah out of prison.</span> (For the phrase used, see <a href="../../par/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13, 19, 20</a>.) The act was probably part of a larger measure of pardon and amnesty, intended to inaugurate favorably the new reign. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-28.htm">2 Kings 25:28</a></div><div class="verse">And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that <i>were</i> with him in Babylon;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake kindly to him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he spake good things with him</span>; but the meaning is well expressed by our rendering. Evil-Merodach compassionated the sufferings of the unfortunate monarch, who had grown old in prison, and strove by kind speech to make up to him for them in a certain measure. <span class="cmt_word">And set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</span> Evil-Merodach had at his court other captured kings besides Jehoiachin, whose presence was considered to enhance his dignity and grandeur (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>). An honorable position and probably a seat of honor was assigned to each; but the highest position among them was now conferred on Jehoiachin. Whether he had actually a more elevated seat, is (as Bahr observes) a mattes of no importance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a></div><div class="verse">And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And changed his prison garments.</span> The subject to "changed" may be either "Jehoiachin" or" Evil-Merodach." Our translators preferred the latter, our Revisers the former. In either case the general meaning is the same. Evil Merodach supplied suitable garments to the released monarch instead of his "prison garments," and Jehoiachin arrayed himself in the comely apparel before taking his seat among his equals. Dresses of honor are among the most common gifts which an Oriental monarch makes to his subjects (see <a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 5:1. &sect; 1). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin - <span class="cmt_word">did eat bread continually before him.</span> Besides giving occasional great feasts (see <a href="../../par/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3-9</a>), Oriental monarchs usually entertain at their table daily a large number of guests, some of whom are specially invited, while others have the privilege of daily attendance (see ' Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 214, 215). It was to this latter class that Jehoiachin was admitted. Comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>, which shows that the custom was one not unknown at the Jewish court. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin's - <span class="cmt_word">life.</span> Jehoisohin enjoyed this privilege till his death. Whether this fell in the lifetime of Evil-Merodach or not, is scarcely in the writer's thoughts. He merely means to tell us that the comparative comfort and dignity which Jehoiachin enjoyed after the accession of Evil-Merodach to the throne was not subsequently clouded over or disturbed. He continued a privileged person at the Baby-Ionian court so long as he lived. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-30.htm">2 Kings 25:30</a></div><div class="verse">And his allowance <i>was</i> a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his allowance was a continual allowance.</span> Keil supposes that this "allowance" was a daily "ration of food," intended for the maintenance of a certain number of servants or retainers. But it is quite as likely to have been a money payment. The word translated by "allowance"  - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> - does not point necessarily to food. It is a "portion' of any kind. <span class="cmt_word">Given him of the king</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, out of the privy purse, by the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">a daily rate for every day</span> - or, a c<span class="accented">ertain amount day by</span> day - <span class="cmt_word">all the days of his life</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse). Beth the privileges accorded to Jehoiachin, his sustenance at the king's table, and his allowance, whether in money or in kind, continued to the day of his death. Neither of them was ever revoked or forfeited. Thus this last representative of the Davidic monarchy, after thirty-six years of chastisement, experienced a happy change of circumstances, and died in peace and comfort. Probably, as Keil says, "this event was intended as a comforting sign to the whole of the captive people, that the Lord would one day put an end to their banishment, if they would acknowledge that it was a well-merited punishment for their sins that they had been driven away from before his face, and would turn again to the Lord their God with all their heart." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/24.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 24"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 24" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm"><title>2 Kings 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_kings/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_kings/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_kings/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_kings/1.htm" title="2 Kings 1">&#9668;</a> 2 Kings 2 <a href="../2_kings/3.htm" title="2 Kings 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven.</span> The subject is introduced as one of general notoriety, the writer professing rather to give the exact details of a well-known fact, than to relate a new fact unknown to his readers. "When the time came," he means to say, "for Elijah's translation, of which you, my readers, all know, the following were the circumstances under which it took place." The fact itself was deeply impressed on the Jewish consciousness. "Elias," says the Sou of Sirach, "was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery homes" (Ecclus. 48:9). He was ranked with Enoch, as not having seen death (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:2. &sect; 2), and was viewed as "continuing in heaven a mysterious life, which no death had ever interrupted, whence he was ready at any time to return to earth" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 113). The scribes thought that he was beyond all doubt to make his appearance upon the earth in person, before the coming of the Messiah (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-10.htm">Matthew 16:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By a whirlwind.</span> <span class="accented">Sa'arach</span> is not so much an actual "whirlwind" as a storm or atmospheric disturbance (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). It is a word which only occurs here in the historical Scriptures. <span class="cmt_word">That Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</span> Elisha had become to Elijah what Joshua was to Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>) - his "minister," or regular attendant, from the time of his call at Abel-meholah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-21.htm">1 Kings 19:21</a>). Elijah had no fixed residence, but moved from place to place as the Spirit of God suggested. His wanderings had now brought him to Gilgal (probably <span class="accented">Jiljilieh</span>, near Nablous), one of the most ancient sanctuaries of the land (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>, etc.), celebrated in the history of Saul and Samuel.

Under ordinary circumstances, the servant would naturally have obeyed his lord, and submitted to a temporary separation; but Elisha has a presentiment, or something stronger than a presentiment, of what is impending (vers. 3, 5), and will not be induced to accelerate by a single moment the time of the last parting. He will remain with his master, ready to do him all needful service, until the end. <span class="cmt_word">To Bethel.</span> Bethel was the spiritual center of the kingdom of the ten tribes. There may have been many reasons why Elijah should visit it once more before he quitted the earth. He may have had directions to leave, consolation to give, words of warning to speak. We must not suppose that the narrative before us is complete. <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth.</span> These were ordinary forms of earnest asseveration with the Israelites, generally used separately (<a href="../../par/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-26.htm">1 Samuel 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-6.htm">1 Samuel 19:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-21.htm">1 Samuel 20:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-11.htm">2 Samuel 11:11</a>, etc.); but on occasions of special solemnity united, as here and in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-26.htm">1 Samuel 25:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-30.htm">2 Kings 4:30</a>). The prophet is not to be blamed for using them, since the command, "Swear not at all," had not yet been given. <span class="cmt_word">I will not leave thee.</span> The resolve indicates strong attachment, deep fidelity, combined, perhaps, with a reasonable curiosity to see how the end would be brought about. <span class="cmt_word">So they went down to Bethel.</span> The expression, "went down," shows that the Gilgal of ver. 1 is not that of the Jordan valley, but the mountain-city between Sichem and Bethel.

The institution of the "schools of the prophets," or theological colleges where young prophets were brought up, is usually assigned to Samuel, one of whose habitual residences for a part of the year was Bethel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). Probably he had established a "school" there which continued to this time. <span class="cmt_word">Came forth to Elisha, and said unto him</span>. The students did not venture to address the master himself, who was a person of too much dignity to be intruded on; but sought out the servant, to give him a warning of what their prophetic instinct assured them was about to happen. <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his position as teacher and master) today? There was, perhaps, something a little officious and self-assertive in this question. They might have felt sure, if they had been properly modest, that Elisha would have at least as much prophetic instinct and foresight as themselves. Hence he answers them with something of rebuke: <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Yea, I know it</span> - literally, <span class="accented">I too know it</span> - <span class="cmt_word">hold ye your peace</span>; or, "Hush - do not chatter about what is so sacred; do not suppose that you are wiser than any one else; be a little modest and a little reticent."

The first trial of Elisha's fidelity is followed by a second. The master suggests his tarrying at Bethel, the sacred center, where he will have the company of the "sons of the prophets," and will not be companionless, as perhaps he would have been at Gilgal. He himself is ordered to take a second journey, longer and rougher than the first. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath sent me to Jericho.</span> Will it not be better that Elisha shall spare himself the long and rugged descent from the high-land of Ephraim to the deep gully of Jordan, and remain with the friends who have sought him out, while his master accomplishes the remainder of his journey alone? <span class="cmt_word">And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.</span> Absolute unchangeableness of resolution is best shown by absolute un-changingness of speech.

This would seem to imply the existence of a large number of such seminaries at this period. No doubt, when the secular power was most strongly opposed to true religion, the prophetical order had to make increased efforts to raise its numbers and multiply its schools. The prophets of Israel, it must be remembered, were, after the withdrawal of the priests and Levites (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13, 14</a>), the sole teachers of the people in true religion.

He is ordered, not to a town, where his follower might find lodging and refreshment and companionship, but into the open country - to the Jordan. And then, who can say whither? Will it not be best for Elisha to leave him now, and not continue a wandering which threatens to be endless?

For the sons of the prophets to have approached nearer, and hung on the skirts of Elijah, would have been an impertinence, Elisha's persistence is only justified by his strong affection, and the special office which he held, of attendant minister. The fifty students showed a courteous sense of what was due to the prophet's desire of seclusion by not pressing on his footsteps, and at the same time a real interest in him, and a reasonable curiosity, by quitting their college and "standing to view" on some eminence which commanded a prospect of the lower Jordan valley. There were many such eminences within a short distance of Jericho. <span class="cmt_word">And they two stood by Jordan.</span> At length all other human companionship was shaken off - "<span class="accented">they two"</span> stood, side by side, on the banks of the sacred stream, which had played so important a part, and was still to play so far more important a part, in the theocratic history. All the world, except their two selves, was remote - was beyond their ken; the master and the servant, the prophet of the past and the prophet of the coming generation, were together, with none to disturb them, or interfere between them, or separate them. Jordan rolled its waters before their eyes, a seeming barrier to further advance; and Elisha may naturally have looked to see the final scene transacted in that "plain below a plain," the Jordan bed, sunk beneath the general level of the Ghor, green with lush grass and aquatic plants, and with beds of reeds and osiers, but squalid with long stretches of mud and masses of decaying vegetation, brought down from the upper river, and with rotting trunks of trees torn from the banks higher up. But the end was not yet. Jordan was to be crossed, and the ascension to take place from the plain whence Moses, when about to quit earth, had made his ascent to Pisgah.

It was intended that Israel should regard Elijah and Elisha as a second Moses and Joshua, and should therefore yield them a ready obedience. If miracles are impossible, <span class="accented">cadit quaestio</span>; exegesis of Scripture, and even reading of Scripture, may as well be put aside. But if they are possible, and have a place in the Divine economy, here was a worthy occasion for them. The powers of the world were arrayed against the cause of true religion and so against God; the cause was about to lose its great champion and assertor, Elijah; a weaker successor was about to take his place; - without some manifest display of supernatural might the cause of religion would evidently have lost ground, perhaps have been ruined altogether. It pleased God, therefore, just at this time, to grant that signs and wonders of an extraordinary character should be done by the hands of his servants Elijah and Elisha, that a halo of mystic glory should encircle them, for the better sustentation of his own cause against his adversaries, for the exaltation and glorification of his faithful ones, and for the confusion and dismay of those who were opposed to them.

And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.</span> Elijah knows that the time is growing now very short. He will soon have left the earth. A yearning comes over him, before he goes, to leave his faithful follower, his trusty, persevering adherent, some parting gift, some token of his appreciation, some sign of his love. What does his "minister" desire? Let him ask what he will, and his master will, if it be possible, grant it. <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</span> Elisha's request has been variously explained. The older commentators regarded him as having asked for twice as much spiritual and prophetical power as Elijah had possessed; and this interpretation is certainly favored by the reply of Elijah, as recorded in the next verse. But it is objected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Elisha's modesty would prevent him from asking so much; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that double the spirit and power of Elijah certainly did not rest upon him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This latter fact is quite undeniable. As Keil says, "It is only a quite external and superficial view of the career of Elisha that can see in it a proof that double the spirit of Elijah rested upon him" ('Commentary on Kings,' <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). To one who looks beneath the surface, and regards something besides length of life and number of miracles, Elisha is a very faint and feeble replica of Elijah. Ewald's judgment is here correct: "Elisha is great only so far as he continues and carries out with more force than any other man of his time the work which Elijah had begun with new and wonderful power... he did not possess any such intensity of inward power as his master" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 82, Eng. trans.). Accordingly, Ewald, rejecting the old explanation, suggests one of his own - that Elisha asked for "two thirds of Elijah's spirit" (ibid., p. 81); but this would be a very strange and unusual request, even if the Hebrew could be made to mean it. Who ever asks for two-thirds of a thing? The third explanation, to which most modern commentators incline (Keil, Thenius, Patrick, Clarke, Pool, Bottcher), is that Elisha merely requested that he might receive twice as much of Elijah's spirit as should be received by any other of the "sons of the prophets." He made a reference to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>, and asked for the "double portion" (literally, "double mouthful") which was the right of an eldest son. The only objection to this view is Elijah's answer (see the next verse). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: <i>nevertheless</i>, if thou see me <i>when I am</i> taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be <i>so</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thou hast been hard in asking</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, LXX.). Perhaps the "hardness" of the request was in the thing asked, not in the quantity of the thing. Had Elisha asked for anything that Elijah had it directly in his power to give, as for his mantle, or his blessing, or his prayers in the other world, to grant the request would have been easy. But he had asked for something that was not Elijah's to give, but only God's. Elijah could not bequeath his spirit, as a man bequeaths his property; he could only pray God that Elisha's pious request might be granted. Nevertheless, <span class="cmt_word">if thou see ms when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</span> Our translators have thought to clear the sense by inserting "nevertheless" and "when I am." But the inserted words would be better away. As Elijah cannot either grant or refuse a request for a spiritual gift, which it is not in his power to Bestow, he is divinely instructed to give Elisha a sign, by which he shall know whether God grants his prayer or not. The sign of acceptance is to be his actually seeing his master's translation. Probably the chariot and horses were not visible to the natural human eye, any more than the angelic hosts were who compassed Elisha himself about at Dothan (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, <i>there appeared</i> a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50, 51</a>,). The antitype answers to the type in little details as well as in the general outline. <span class="cmt_word">That behold, there appeared a chariot of firs, and horses of fire.</span> God's "angels are spirits, and his ministers <span class="accented">a flaming fire"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>). When the eyes of Elisha's servant were opened, and he saw the angelic host that protected his master, it appeared to him that "the mountain was full of horses and chariots <span class="accented">of fire</span> round about Elisha" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Material fire is, of course, not to be thought cf. But the glory and brightness of celestial beings, when made visible to man, has some analogy with fire, or at any rate brings the conception of fire before the mind. The historian doubtless reports the account which Elisha gave of what he saw on this memorable occasion. <span class="cmt_word">And parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and Elijah went up in a storm into the heavens</span>. There is no mention of a "whirlwind;" and "the heavens" are primarily the visible firmament or sky which overhangs the earth. Elijah, like our Lord, rose bodily from the earth into the upper region of the air, and was there lost to sight. Three only of the seed of Adam - Enoch, Elijah, Jesus - have passed from earth to heaven without dying.

But Elisha probably meant something more than to show respect. He regarded himself as Elijah's specially adopted son, and hence had claimed the "double portion" of the firstborn. That his request was granted showed that the relationship was acknowledged. <span class="cmt_word">The chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the best earthly defense of Israel.

Note the substitution of "horsemen" for "horses," and comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10</a>, where the same expression is used in reference to Elisha. <span class="cmt_word">And he saw him no more.</span> Elijah passed beyond Elisha's ken.

Is he still here, with me, or has he withdrawn himself from earth with his prophet, and left me alone to my own unaided strength? This gives a good meaning, but is perhaps too bold a change.

Probably they had seen the passage of the Jordan by the two prophets, the disappearance of Elijah, and the return of Elisha across the stream in a way which they may have suspected to be miraculous. But the Jordan is four or five miles distant from the city of Jericho, and their apprehension of the various circumstances would be incomplete, and more or less vague. Perhaps there was something in Elisha's appearance and expression of countenance which impressed them, and appeared to them to mark his exaltation to a higher dignity and spiritual position. <span class="cmt_word">And they came to meet him; and bowed themselves to the ground before him; thus acknowledging him for their master, as they had been wont to acknowledge Elijah.</span>

Thenius suggests that Elisha first related to them what had befallen his master; but the impression left by the narrative is rather that <span class="accented">they</span> began the conversation, being aware of Elijah's disappearance, which in that clear atmosphere they may have distinctly perceived, though the ascension may not have been visible to them. Keil thinks that they saw the ascension, but supposed that the body, after being taken up a certain height into the air, would necessarily fall to earth, and that they wished to find it and bury it. But the natural interpretation is that they thought the prophet had been "caught away" by a Divine influence, as Philip the evangelist was in later times (<a href="../../par/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), and would be found somewhere alive, as Philip "was found at Azotus." <span class="cmt_word">Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men</span>; literally, sons <span class="accented">of strength</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> stout, active persons, capable of climbing the rough and precipitous rocks among which they thought that Elijah might be east. <span class="cmt_word">Let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.</span> On either side of the <span class="accented">ciccar</span>, or Jordan plain, are rugged districts, consisting of alternate rocky mountain slopes and narrow gulleys, or water-courses, dry during the greater part of the year.

It is always a hard thing for one man to refuse the repeated and earnest request of a multitude.

Lying on a broad plain which is traversed by an abundant river, at the point where one of the main wadys debouched from the Judaean upland upon the low country, shaded by groves of palm trees (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>) and fig-mulberries (<a href="../../par/luke/19-4.htm">Luke 19:4</a>), the air scented with aromatic shrubs, opobalsam, myroba-lanum, and the like, facing the Orient sun, and commanding a wide prospect both across and also up and down the Ghor, with the mountains of Moab in the distance, Jericho was, no doubt, even before the miracle of Elisha, a "pleasant" place. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - there was one drawback - <span class="cmt_word">the water is naught, and the ground barren.</span> Bitter and brackish springs, of which there are many in the Jordan valley, gushed forth from the foot of the mountains, and formed rivulets, which ran across the plain towards the Jordan, not diffusing health and fertility, but rather disease and barrenness. Untimely births, abortions, and the like prevailed among the cattle which were fed in the neighborhood, perhaps even among the inhabitants of the locality, and were attributed to the bitter springs, which made the land "miscarrying" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.).

Ain-es-Sultan is described as "a large and beautiful fountain of sweet and pleasant water" (Robinson, 'Researches,' vol. 2. p. 384), and as "scattering, even at the hottest season, the richest and most grateful vegetation over what would otherwise be a bare tract of sandy soft."

Such mischievous youths are among the chief nuisances of Oriental towns; they waylay the traveler, deride him, jeer him - are keen to remark any personal defect that he may have, and merciless in flouting it; they dog his steps, shout out their rude remarks, and sometimes proceed from abusive words to violent acts, as the throwing of sticks, or stones, or mud. On this occasion they only got as far as rude words. <span class="cmt_word">And mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head! go up, thou bald head!</span> It has been maintained that the scoff of the lads contained an allusion to the ascension of Elijah (Patrick, Pool, Clarke), of which they had beard, and was a call upon Elisha to follow his master's example in quitting the world, that they might be no longer troubled with him. But it is not at all apparent that the lads even knew who Elisha was - they would probably have jeered at <span class="accented">any</span> aged person with whom they had fallen in; and by "Go up" they merely meant "Go on thy way; 'the force of their jeer was not in the word' <span class="accented">aleh</span>, but in the word <span class="accented">kereach</span>, "bald head." Baldness was sometimes produced by leprosy, and then made a man unclean (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-42.htm">Leviticus 13:42-44</a>); but the boys probably flouted the mere natural defect, in which there was no "uncleanness" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-40.htm">Leviticus 13:40, 41</a>), but which they regarded as a fit subject for ridicule. Their sin was disrespect towards old age, combined, perhaps, with disrespect for the prophetical order, to which they may have known from his dress that Elisha belonged.

Under the Law God's ministers were required to curse the disobedient (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14-26</a>). Elisha could not tell what would be the effect of his curse. It could have no effect at all excepting through the will and by the action of God. <span class="cmt_word">And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood</span>; or, <span class="accented">the forest</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the forest, which, as all knew, lay within a short distance of Bethel, and was the haunt of wild beasts (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-24.htm">1 Kings 3:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And tare forty and two children of them.</span> It is not said how far the lads were injured, whether fatally or not. But the punishment, whatever its severity, came from God, not from the prophet, and we may be sure was just. For "shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" A severe example may have been needed under the circumstances of the time, when a new generation was growing up in contempt of God and of religion; and the sin of the lads was not a small one, but indicated that determined bent of the will against good, and preference of evil, which is often developed early, and generally goes on from bad to worse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/2-25.htm">2 Kings 2:25</a></div><div class="verse">And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went from thence to Mount Carmel.</span> Ewald thinks that Carmel was, on the whole, the main residence of Elijah, and "through him became a special prophetic locality" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 68). If so, we may account for Elisha's visiting it on this occasion by his desire to communicate the facts of Elijah's removal from earth to those who had been his intimates in that quarter. <span class="cmt_word">And from thence he returned to Samaria.</span> Elisha does not imitate the wild, half-savage life and almost constant seclusion of his master. He "prefers from the first the companionship of men," fixes his home in the capital of his country, Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-9.htm">2 Kings 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>); is a friendly counselor of the king (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9</a>), and highly honored by him (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>); his whole life, indeed, is, compared with that of Elijah, one of ease and tranquility. But, though living "in the world," he is not "of the world." As Ewald says, "In spite of all the seductions to which he was abundantly exposed through the great consideration in which he was held, he retained at every period of his life the true prophetic simplicity and purity, and contempt for worldly wealth and advantages" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 83). He is thus, far more than Elijah, a pattern for Christian ministers, especially for such as are highly placed, who will do well to follow his example. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

But an image of the god for whom a "house" was built was so much a matter of course in the idolatrous systems of the East, that it might have seemed superfluous to mention it. The actual existence of the image appears later, when its destruction is recorded (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>). It seems that Jehoram, at the commencement of his reign, took warning by the fates of his father and brother, so far as to abolish the state worship of Baal, which his father had introduced, and to remove the image of Baal from the temple where it had been set up. The image, however, was not destroyed - it was only "put away."

The maintenance of the calf-worship was, no doubt, viewed as a political necessity. If the two sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel had been shut up, the images broken, and the calf-worship brought to an end, there would, as a matter of course, have been a general flocking of the more religious among the people to the great sanctuary of Jehovah at Jerusalem; and this adoption of Jerusalem as a spiritual center would naturally have led on to its acceptance as the general political center of the whole Israelite people. Israel, as a separate kingdom, a distinct political entity, would have disappeared. Hence every Israelite monarch, even the Jehovistic Jehu, felt himself bound, by the political exigencies of his position, to keep up the calf-worship, and maintain the religious system of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

The historian goes back to the origin of the war. He had already, in <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>, mentioned the revolt of Moab at the death of Ahab; but he now recalls his readers' attention to the fact, and to some extent explains it and accounts for it. Moab had been treated oppressively - had been forced to pay an extraordinarily heavy tribute - and was in a certain sense driven into rebellion (vers. 4, 5). Jehoram, when he came to the kingdom, determined to make a great effort to put the rebellion down, and to re-establish the authority of Israel over the revolted people His relations with Jehoshaphat of Israel were so close that he had no difficulty in persuading him to join in the war. He was also able to obtain the alliance of the King of Edom. Thus strengthened, he made no doubt of being successful, and confidently invaded the country (vers. 6-9). The course of the war is then related (vers. 10-27).

He had joined Ahab in his attack on the Syrians at Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>), and had thereby incurred the rebuke of Jehu the son of Hanani (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). This, however, had net prevented him from continuing his friendship with the Israelite royal house; he "joined himself with Ahaziah" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a>), Ahab's successor, and though their combined naval expedition met with disaster (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), yet he still maintained amicable relations with the Israelite court. Jehoram, therefore, confidently sought his active help when he made up his mind to engage in a war with Moab. <span class="cmt_word">The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle! And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my hones as thy horses.</span> Compare the answer which the same king had made to Ahab, when requested to join him in his attack on the Syrians (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>). The words were probably a common formula expressive of willingness to enter into the closest possible alliance. Jehoshaphat, it appears from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-35</a>, had, a little before this, been himself attacked by the united forces of Moab and Ammon, and brought into a peril from which he was only delivered by miracle.

There 'were two ways in which Moab might be approached - the direct one across the Jordan and then southward through the country east of the Dead Sea to the Amen, which was the boundary between Moab and Israel; and a circuitous one through the desert west of the Red Sea, and across the Arabah south of it, then northwards through Northern Edom, to the brook Zered, or Wady-el- Ahsy, which was the boundary between Moab and Edom. If the former route were pursued, Moab would be entered on the north; if the latter, she would be attacked on the south. Jehoshaphat recommended the circuitous route. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom</span>; probably for two reasons: Edom, though under a native king, was a dependency of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and on passing through the Edomite country, an Edomite contingent might be added to the invading force; Moab, moreover, was mere likely to be surprised by an attack on this quarter, which was unusual, and from which she would not anticipate danger.

Now, apparently, she has her own native "king."

As he had made no attempt to learn God's will on the subject at the mouth of any prophet, he had no ground for surprise or complaint, even had the peril been as great as he supposed. God had not "called the three kings together;" they had come together of their own accord, guided by their own views of earthly policy.

Even now he was engaged in an expedition which had received no Divine sanction, and was allied with two idolatrous monarchs. But Elisha condones these derelictions of duty in consideration of the king's honesty of purpose and steady attachment to Jehovah, which is witnessed to by the authors both of Kings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>) and Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4-11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-5.htm">2 Chronicles 20:5-21</a>, etc.). He "regards the presence of Jehoshaphat," and therefore consents to return an answer to the three kings, and announce to them the mode of their deliverance. The adjuration wherewith he opens his speech is one of great solemnity, only used upon very special occasions (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>), and adds great force to his declaration.

What Elisha promises is a heavy storm of wind accompanied by violent rain, which, however, will be at such a distance that the Israelites will see nothing of it, but whereof they will experience the effects when the torrent-course that separates them from the Moabite country suddenly becomes a rushing stream as the rain flows off down it. Their "pits," or trenches, will retain a portion of the water, and furnish them with a sufficient supply for their wants. It was necessary that the storm should be distant, that the Moabites might know nothing of it, and so fall under the delusion (ver. 23), which led to their complete defeat. <span class="cmt_word">Yet that valley shall be filled with water.</span> Travelers tell us that, in certain circumstances, it takes but ten minutes or a quarter of an hour for a dry water-course in the East to become a raging torrent quite impassable. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the animals which you have brought with you for food - and your boasts; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> your beasts of burden, or baggage-animals.

The words are, "When thou shalt besiege a city.... thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: <span class="accented">for thou mayest eat of them</span>." The destruction of the fruit trees in an enemy's country was a common feature of the wars of the period, and was largely practiced, both By the Assyrians and the Egyptians (see Layard's 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, p. 73; second series, pl. 40; 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 588; and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 5, 51, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And stop all wells of water.</span> The stoppage of springs and wells was another common practice in ancient times, often employed against enemies and aliens. The Philistines stopped the Hebrew wells in the days of Isaac (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>). Hezekiah stopped the springs of water outside Jerusalem, when he expected to be besieged By the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3, 4</a>). The Scythians, when Darius invaded their country, stopped all their own wells as they retired before him (Herod., 4:120). Arsaces III. partly stopped, and partly poi-ached, the Persian wells in his war with Antiochus the Great (Polyb., 10:28. &sect; 5). The practice was regarded as quite legitimate. <span class="cmt_word">And mar every good piece of land with stones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">grieve every good piece of land</span>. To clear the stones off a piece of ground was the first step towards preparing it for cultivation in the stony regions on either side of the Jordan. The clearance was generally effected by collecting the stones into heaps. When it was wished to "mar the land," the stones were there to be spread over it afresh.

A ruddy sunrise is common in the East, more especially in stormy weather (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-3.htm">Matthew 16:3</a>); and the red light, falling upon the water in the pits, and reflected thence to the opposite side of the wady, would quite sufficiently account for the mistake of the Moabites, without supposing that the water was actually stained and discolored. The Moabites concluded that the red-looking liquid was blood, from knowing that the wady was dry the day before, and from not suspecting that there had been any change in the night, as the storm which had caused the change was at such a distance.

Edom especially was, it is probable, a reluctant member of the confederacy, forced to take her part in it by her suzerain, Jehoshaphat. The Moabites, moreover, had recently had personal experience how easily the swords of confederates might be turned against each other, since their last expedition against Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-25</a>) had completely failed through such a sudden disagreement and contention. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</span> If their supposition were correct, and the kings had come to blows, and the hosts destroyed each other, Moab would have nothing to do but to fly upon the spoil, to strip the slain, and plunder the camp of the confederates.

Kir-haraseth, which is not mentioned among the early Moabite towns, nor even upon the Moabite Stone, and which is therefore thought to have been a newly constructed fortress (Ewald), was, in the later times, one of the most important of the strongholds of Moab (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>). It was sometimes called Kir-Moab, "the fortress of Moab." At what time it got the name of Kerak is uncertain; but we find it spoken of as Kerak-Moab by Ptolemy (about A.D. ), and by Stephen of Byzantium (about A.D. ). It was a place of much importance in the time of the Crusades. The situation is one of great strength. The fortress is built upon the top of a steep hill, surrounded on all sides by a deep arid narrow valley, which again is completely enclosed by mountains, rising higher than the fort itself. It is undoubtedly one of the strongest positions within the territory anciently possessed by the Moabites. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</span> Ewald thinks that by "<span class="accented">slingers"</span> are meant, not mere ordinary slingers, but persons who worked more elaborate engines, as catapults and the like ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 89, note, Eng. trans.). He is undoubtedly correct in saying that "all sorts of elaborate modes of attacking fortifications were very early known in Asia;" but it is very questionable whether the Hebrew word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) can mean anything but "slingers" in the usual sense.

A former King of Moab, when in a sore strait, had asked, "Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" (<a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>); and there is reason to believe that a chief element in the worship of Chemosh was the sacrifice of young children by their unnatural parents. The practice rested on the idea that God was best pleased when men offered to him what was dearest and most precious to them; but it was in glaring contradiction to the character of God as revealed by his prophets, and it did violence to the best and holiest instincts of human nature. The Law condemned it in the strongest terms as a profanation of the Divine Name (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-1.htm">Leviticus 20:1-5</a>), and neither Jeroboam nor Ahab ventured to introduce it when they established their idolatrous systems. The King of Mesh, undoubtedly, offered the sacrifice to his god Chemosh (see Moabite Stone, lines 3, 4, 8, 12, etc.), hoping to propitiate him, and by his aid to escape from the peril in which he found himself placed. HIS motive for offering the sacrifice <span class="cmt_word">upon the wall</span> is not so clear. It was evidently done to attract the notice of the besiegers, but with what further <span class="accented">object</span> is uncertain. Ewald thinks the king's intention was to" confound the enemy by the spectacle of the frightful deed to which they had forced him," and thus to "effect a change in their purposes" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 90); but perhaps it is as likely that he hoped to work upon their fears, and induce them to retire under the notion that, if they did not, Chemosh would do them some terrible injury. <span class="cmt_word">And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed.</span> It seems necessary to connect these clauses, and to regard them as assigning cause and effect. The deed done aroused an indignation against Israel, which led to the siege being raised. But an indignation on whose part? Keil thinks, on God's. But could God be angry with Israel for an act of the King of Moab, which they had no ground for anticipating, and which they could not possibly have pro-vented? especially when the Israelites had done nothing to cause the act, except by carrying out God's own command to them through his prophet, to "smite every fenced city and every choice city" (ver. 19). The indignation, therefore, must have been human. But who felt it? Probably the Moabites. The terrible act of their king, to which they considered that Israel had driven him, stirred up such a feeling of fury among the residue of the Moabite nation, that the confederates quailed before it, and came to the conclusion that they had best give up the siege and retire. They therefore departed from him - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the King of Mesh - and returned to their own land; severally to Edom, Judea, and Samaria. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm"><title>2 Kings 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_kings/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_kings/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_kings/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_kings/3.htm" title="2 Kings 3">&#9668;</a> 2 Kings 4 <a href="../2_kings/5.htm" title="2 Kings 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying.</span> We learn from this that the "sons of the prophets" were not merely, all of them, college students, but included fathers of families, who cannot have lived a cloistered life, but must have had separate homes for themselves and their families. Such persons may still have taught in the prophetical schools, as do the married tutors and professors of modern universities. <span class="cmt_word">Thy servant my husband is dead.</span> Elisha had, it seems, known her husband, who had been his "servant," not literally and in deed, but in will and heart, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> always ready to serve him. She recalls this fact to his memory, to predispose him in her favor. <span class="cmt_word">And thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord.</span> Here was a second ground for Elisha's interference - the woman's husband had been a God-fearing man, one who not only acknowledged Jehovah, but worshipped him in spirit and in truth. There is a Jewish tradition, or legend, that the woman's husband was the Obadiah of <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3-16</a>, but no dependence can be placed on it. Obadiah, the "governor of Ahab's house," can scarcely have been one of the "sons of the prophets." <span class="cmt_word">And the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to he bondmen.</span> In primitive communities, men borrowed upon their personal credit, and the primary security for debt was regarded as being their own persons, the value of their labor, and that of those dependent on them. In Greece and Rome, originally, as in the Hebrew community, borrowers ordinarily raised money by pledging their persons, and, if they could not pay when the debt became due, went into servitude with their children. The Mosaic Law presupposes this state of things, and permits its continuance, but in two respects interferes to modify it: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by requiring that the service exacted shall not be severe (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-43.htm">Leviticus 25:43, 46</a>), but such as was commonly rendered by hired servants (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 40</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by limiting the period of service to the date of the next jubilee year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus 25:40, 41</a>). In the instance brought here under our notice, it would seem that the creditor had not proceeded to claim his rights until the debtor died, when he on-forced them against the man's children (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1-8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house?

This is, no doubt, in part, because she is a widow. Widows were, in the Law, especially commended to the attention and care of the faithful. As Bahr says, "It is a well-known feature of the Mosaic Law, one which is distinctly prominent, that it often and urgently commands to succor the widows and the fatherless, and to care for them (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>).

(<a href="../../par/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16</a>; Tobit 1:7; <a href="../../par/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Elisha could also gather from the tone of the woman's address that she, like her late husband, was God-fearing. <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, what hast thou in the house?</span> Hast thou anything, that is, which thou canst soil, and so pay the debt? <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Thins handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil</span>; literally, <span class="accented">save an anointing of oil</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so much oil as will suffice for one anointing of my person.

Attention was not to be called to it - perhaps because otherwise the prophet would have been overwhelmed with applications from others; perhaps because the act was not a mere mechanical one, but required that, during its performance, the hearts of the woman and of her sons should be lifted up in prayer and adoration and thankfulness to God for the mercy which he was bestowing. Interruption from without would have interfered with the frame of mind which was befitting the occasion. Compare our Lord's secret performance of many miracles. <span class="cmt_word">And shalt pour out into all those vessels</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those which thou shalt have borrowed - <span class="cmt_word">and thou shalt set aside that which is full</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as each vessel is filled, it shall be removed and set aside, and one of the empty vessels substituted - that the pouring might be continuous.

The prophet directs the woman to sell the whole, and, after satisfying the claim of her creditor with part of the money, to support herself and her children on the remainder.

It occurs only here and in the opening chapters of the Book of Job (Job 1:6, 13; 2:1). The most literal rendering would be, <span class="accented">and the day came when</span>. Elisha passed to Shunem. Shunem was a village of Galilee, situated in the territory assigned to Issachar (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). It is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Solam</span>, at the south-eastern foot of the Gebel Duhy, or "Little Hermon," a "flourishing village encompassed by gardens" (Porter), and "in the midst of the finest corn-fields in the world" (Grove), on the edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. Elisha, in his progression to different parts of the northern kingdom, happened to come on one occasion to Shunem. <span class="cmt_word">Where was a great woman.</span> Houbigant strangely translates, "a tan woman," maintaining that a woman would not be called "great" in the sense of "wealthy" during her husband's lifetime; but no other commentator has accepted his view. The meaning seems to be that she was a woman of substance, one well-to-do, perhaps one that had brought her husband the bulk of his wealth. <span class="cmt_word">And she constrained him to eat bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she invited him in as he passed her house, and would take no denial. Compare Lot's pressing hospitality, as related in <a href="../../par/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</span> Elisha, it appears, had frequent occasion to pass through Shunem on his way from Carmel to visit the cities of Galilee, or <span class="accented">versa</span>. It became his habit, on these journeys, to eat his meals at the house of the rich Shunammite. Hence arose a kindly feeling on both sides and a close intimacy.

In Elisha's time, as in all others, there were among the teachers of religion some who were "wolves in sheep's clothing:' The Shunammite woman, after a certain length of acquaintance, came to the conclusion that Elisha deserved the title which he commonly bore, was truly a "man of God," a real devoted servant of Jehovah. She therefore wished to do more for him than she had hitherto done. <span class="cmt_word">Which passeth by us continually</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who passes through our village, and has his meals with us so frequently.

He seems to have been Elisha's "servant" in a lower sense than Elisha had been Elijah's. Still, his position was such that on one occasion (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4, 5</a>) a king of Israel did not disdain to hold a conversation with him. <span class="cmt_word">Call this Shunammite.

Perhaps she aims at impressing on Elisha that she has had no selfish motive in what she has done for him, but has merely wished to honor God in his prophet. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-14.htm">2 Kings 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, What then <i>is</i> to be done for her?

Has he heard her express any wish? Does he know of any boon that would be welcome to her? Evidently the woman's disinterestedness has increased the prophet's desire to do something for her. b It does not appear that the woman had made any complaint or exhibited any special anxiety on the subject of offspring. But Gehazi knows, that to be barren is regarded by all Hebrew women as a re-preach, that it exposes them to scorn and contumely (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6, 7</a>), and that offspring is universally, or all but universally, desired. He therefore assumes that the Shunammite must wish for it. And Elisha accepts his suggestion without a moment's hesitation.

Elijah had placed on his own bed the child whom he restored to life (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19</a>); and the fact may have been known to the Shunammite. She certainly did not expect mere contact with the bed to resuscitate her child. <span class="cmt_word">And shut the door upon him.</span> Either that the body should not be disturbed, or rather that the death should not be known. It is clear that, from whatever motive, the woman wished to conceal the death of the child until she had seen what Elisha could do for her.

It was not either "new moon" or "sabbath"  - times when evidently the prophets conducted services, which were attended by pious persons from the neighborhood: what could she want of Elisha? He had evidently no idea that the child was dead.

It was not usual for his disciples to intrude upon him there, except at stated times, when gatherings were held at his residence for edification and for worship. <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off</span> - literally, over <span class="accented">against him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> coming towards him  (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite.</span> The prophet knew her at a distance, probably by her attire and carriage.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-26.htm">2 Kings 4:26</a></div><div class="verse">Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, <i>Is it</i> well with thee? <i>is it</i> well with thy husband? <i>is it</i> well with the child?

His anxiety is aroused, and, in his impatience to know what has happened, instead of waiting for the woman's arrival, he bids his servant run, and ask what is the matter. Some misfortune, he supposes, must have happened either to her, or to her husband, or to the child. <span class="cmt_word">And she answered, It is well.</span> She gave, as before to her husband (ver. 23), the ambiguous answer, "Peace," intending thereby merely to put off Gehazi, and not explain herself to any one but his master.

It has always been usual in the East to embrace the feet or the knees, in order to add force to supplication. <span class="cmt_word">But Gehazi came near to thrust her away.</span> He regarded the act as one unduly familiar or unduly importunate, and interfered to protect and release his master. <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her.</span> Elisha would not have the woman disturbed. He saw that she was in deep distress, and, if there was anything unseemly in her action according to the etiquette of the time, excused it to her profound grief and distraction. The ordinary mind is a slave to conventionalities; the superior mind knows when to be above them. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</span> God had not informed Elisha, by inward miraculous illumination, of the illness of the child, or its death, or the wild hopes stirring in the afflicted mother's mind, which induced her to make her long and troublesome journey. We need not feel surprised at this. There is always a limit to the miraculous; and facts that may be learnt by a little inquiry are but rarely communicated supernaturally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-28.htm">2 Kings 4:28</a></div><div class="verse">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</span> The woman does not directly reveal her grief. Great sorrow is reticent, cannot endure to put itself into words. But she sufficiently indicates the nature of her trouble by the form of her reproach. "Did I ask for a son? Did I make complaint of my childlessness? Had I been importunate, and obtained my son of thee by much asking, I would not have complained. But I did not ask. I did not even snatch greedily at the offer. I demurred. I said, 'Do not deceive me.' But now thou hast done worse than deceive me. Thou hast kept the word of promise to the ear, and broken it to the hope. It is greater misery to have a child and lose him, than never to have had one at all." All this, and more, seems to be involved in the woman's words. And the prophet fully understood their meaning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a></div><div class="verse">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Than he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again.</span> The object of all these injunctions is haste. Lose not a moment. Go as quickly as thou canst to the house where the child lies. Spend no time in greetings on the way. Slack not. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry not. And lay my staff upon the face of the child.</span> What effect the prophet expected from this act, we are not told. Gehazi appears to have expected that it would at once cause a resuscitation (ver. 31); but there is no evidence that the prophet participated in the expectation. He may have done so, for prophets are not infallible beyond the sphere of the revelations made to them; but he may only have intended to comfort and cheer the mother, and to raise in her an expectation of the resuscitation which he trusted it would be allowed him to effect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-30.htm">2 Kings 4:30</a></div><div class="verse">And the mother of the child said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.

But her own resolution was long ago taken - she would be content with nothing less than bringing the prophet face to face with her dead child. She "will not leave" him till he consents to accompany her to her home. <span class="cmt_word">And he arose, and followed her</span>; as, no doubt, he had intended from the first. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-31.htm">2 Kings 4:31</a></div><div class="verse">And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but <i>there was</i> neither voice, nor hearing.

The child was not reused by the staff being placed across his face. All remained still and silent as before. Although on some occasions it has pleased God to allow miracles to be wrought by the instrumentality of lifeless objects, as when Elisha's hones resuscitated a dead man (<a href="../../par/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>), and when virtue went out from the hem of our Lord's garment (<a href="../../par/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>), and still more remarkably, when "handkerchiefs or aprons from the body of Paul were brought unto the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits were case out of them" (<a href="../../par/acts/19-12.htm">Acts 19:12</a>); yet the instances are, comparatively speaking, rare, and form exceptions to what may be called the usual Divine economy of miracles. Miracles are, as a general rule, attached in Scripture to intense unwavering faith - faith, sometimes, in those that are the objects of them, almost always in those that are the workers of them. The present case was not to be an exception to the general rule, the circumstances not calling for an exception. The power of faith was to be shown forth once more in Elisha, as not long previously in Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19-23</a>); and Israel was to be taught, by a second marvelous example, how much the effectual fervent prayer of a faithful and righteous man avails with the Most High. The lesson would have been lest had the staff been allowed to effect the resuscitation. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore he</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> Gehazi - <span class="cmt_word">went again to meet him</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> Elisha - <span class="cmt_word">and told him, saying, The child is not waked.</span> It is clear from this, that Gehazi had expected an awakening; but there is nothing to show what the prophet himself had expected. We are certainly not entitled to conclude, with Peter Martyr,' that "Elisha did wrong in attempting to 'delegate his power of working miracles to another;" or even, with Starke, that "Elisha gave the command to Gehazi from over haste, without having any Divine incentive to it."

Recent critics have mostly come to the conclusion that the vegetable intended is the <span class="accented">Cucumis agrestis</span> or <span class="accented">Ecbalium elaterium</span>, the "squirting cucumber" of English naturalists. This is a kind of gourd, the fruit of which is egg-shaped, has a bitter taste, and bursts when ripe at a slight touch, squirting out sap and seeds. The main ground for this conclusion is etymologieal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> being derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5e2;</span>, "to crack" or "split." Another theory, and one which has the ancient versions in its favor, identifies the "gourd" in question with the fruit of the colocynth, which is a gourd-like plant that creeps along the ground, and has a round yellow fruit of the size of a large orange. This fruit is exceedingly bitter, produces colic, and affects the nerves<span class="cmt_word">.

Rushing, therefore, at once to the worst possible supposition, they concluded that they were poisoned, and exclaimed, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!"

Elisha seems not to have hesitated for a moment. Prompt measures must be taken, if poisoning is even suspected. He has meal brought - not that meal has any virtue in itself against colocynth, or against any other deleterious drug. But he acts, now as always, under Divine direction, and is instructed to use meal on this occasion, as he used salt in healing the waters of Jericho. The meal, as Keil observes, "might somewhat modify the bitterness and injurious qualities of the vegetable," whatever it was, but "could not possibly take them entirely away.  The meal, the most wholesome food of man, was only the earthly substratum for the working of the Divine effluence which proceeded from Elisha, and made the noxious food perfectly wholesome." <span class="cmt_word">And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out now for the people</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the assembled company of sons of the prophets - <span class="cmt_word">that they may eat.

By "north" we must probably understand "northeast," since the "land of Shalisha" lay between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>). The position thus indicated would not be very far from the Gilgal (<span class="accented">Jiljileh</span>) of <a href="../../par/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2</a>. and 2 Kings 4:38. <span class="cmt_word">And brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits.</span> It is clear that the more pious among the Israelites not only looked to the prophets for religious instruction (ver. 23), but regarded them as having inherited the position of the Levitical priests whom Jeroboam's innovations had driven from the country. The firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil were assigned by the Law (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4, 5</a>) to the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Twenty loaves of barley.</span> The "loaves" of the Israelites were cakes or rolls, rather than "loaves" in the modern sense of the word.

But the analogy of our Lord's miracles of feeding the multitudes, whereof this is a manifest type, makes it probable that in this case also there was a miraculous increase of the food. The object of the writer in communicating the account is certainly not merely to show how the Lord cared for his servants, but to relate another miracle wrought by Elisha, of a different kind from those previously related.

She has, in her servile condition, contracted an affection both for her master and her mistress, and her sympathies are strongly with them. Perhaps she had no serious purpose in speaking as she did. The words burst from her as a mere expression of goodwill. She did not contemplate any action resulting from them. "Oh that things could be otherwise than as they are!

Any notion of her vague wish being carried out, being made the ground of a serious embassy, was probably far from the girl's thought. But the "bread cast upon the waters returns after many days." There is no kind wish or kind utterance that may not have a result far beyond anything that the wisher or utterer contemplated. Good wishes are seeds that ofttimes take root, and grow, and blossom, and bear fruit beyond the uttermost conception of those who sow them.

Written communications seem to have led to the outbreak of the war by which the foreign dynasty of the Hyksos was driven out of Egypt, and the native supremacy reestablished ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 199, 200). Written engagements were certainly entered into between the Egyptian kings and the Hittites at a date earlier than the Exodus (ibid., pp. 291, 310).

Elisha's early miracles were mostly wrought with a certain amount of secrecy. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</span> The king misjudged Benhadad, but not without some grounds of reason, if he was ignorant of Elisha's miraculous gifts.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-9.htm">2 Kings 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot.</span> The Syrians had had chariots, and used horses to draw them, from a remote date. The Hyksos, who introduced horses and chariots into Egypt, though not exactly a Syrian people, entered Egypt from Syria; and in all the Syrian wars of the Egyptians, which began about  <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span>, we find their adversaries employing a chariot force. In one representation of a fight between the Egyptians and a people invading Egypt from' Syria, the war-chariots of the latter are drawn by four oxen; but generally the horse was used on both sides. Syria imported her horses and chariots from Egypt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>), and, as appears from this passage, employed them for peaceful as well as for warlike purposes. There was a similar employment of them from a very early time in Egypt (see <a href="../../par/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And stood at the door of the house of Elisha</span>. Elisha was at this time residing in Samaria, whether in his own house or not we cannot say. His abode was probably a humble one; and when the great general, accompanied by his cavalcade of followers, drew up before it, he had, we may be sure, no intention of dismounting and entering. What he expected he tells us himself in ver. 11. The prophet regarded his pride and self-conceit as deserving of a rebuke. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha sent a messenger unto him.</span> Elisha asserted the dignity of his office. Naaman was "a great man" (ver. 1), with a high sense of his own importance, and regarded the prophet as very much inferior to himself. He expected to be waited on, courted, to receive every possible attention. Elisha no doubt intended very pointedly to rebuke him by remaining in his house, and communicating with the great man by a messenger. But there is no ground for taxing him with "priestly pride," or even with "impoliteness" on this account. He had to impress upon the Syrian noble the nothingness of wealth and earthly grandeur, and the dignity of the prophetic office. He did not do more than was requisite for these purposes. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times.</span>  Elisha speaks no doubt, "by the word of the Lord."  He is directed to require of Naaman a compliance with a somewhat burdensome order. The nearest point on the course of Jordan was above twenty miles distant from Samaria. Naaman is to go thither, to strip himself, and to plunge into the stream seven times. The directions seem given to test his faith. They may be compared with that of our Lord to the blind man, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam," and, in another point of view, with that given to Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3-5</a>), and that of Elijah to his servant (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-43.htm">1 Kings 18:43</a>). To repeat a formal act six times with- out perceiving any result, and yet to persevere and repeat it a seventh time, requires a degree of faith and trust that men do not often possess. <span class="cmt_word">And thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</span> The scaly leprous scurf shall fall off and reveal clean flesh underneath.

As a "great man," the lord on whose arm the king leant, and the captain of the host of Syria, Naaman was accustomed to extreme deference, and all the outward tokens of respect and reverence. He had, moreover, come with a goodly train, carrying gold and silver and rich stuffs, manifestly prepared to pay largely for whatever benefit he might receive. To be curtly told, "Go, wash in Jordan," by the prophet's servant, without the prophet himself condescending to make himself visible, would have been trying to any Oriental's temper, and to one of Naaman's rank and position might well seem an insult. The Syrian general had pictured to himself a very different scene. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the Name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper</span>; rather, take away <span class="accented">the leprosy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). Naaman had imagined a striking scene, whereof he was to be the central figure, the prophet descending, with perhaps a wand of office, the attendants drawn up on either side, the passers-by standing to gaze  - a solemn invocation of the Deity, a waving to and fro of the wand in the prophet's hand, and a sudden manifest cure, wrought in the open street of the city, before the eyes of men, and at once noised abroad through the capital, so as to make him "the observed of all observers, the cynosure of all neighboring eyes." Instead of this, he is bidden to go as he came, to ride twenty miles to the stream of the Jordan, generally muddy, or at least discolored, and there to wash himself, with none to look on but his own attendants, with no <span class="accented">eclat</span>, no pomp or circumstance, no glory of surroundings. It is not surprising that he was disappointed and vexed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-12.htm">2 Kings 5:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Are</i> not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?</span> The "rivers of Damascus" are streams of great freshness and beauty. The principal one is the Barada, probably the Abaua of the present passage, which, rising in the Antilibanus range, and flowing through a series of romantic glens, bursts finally from the mountains through a deep gorge and scatters itself over the plain. One branch passes right through the city of Damascus, cutting it in half. Others flow past the city both on the north and on the south, irrigating the gardens and orchards, and spreading fertility far and wide over the Merj. A small stream, the Fidjeh, flows into the Barada from the north. Another quite independent river, the Awaaj. waters the southern portion of the Damascene plain, but does not approach within several miles of the city. Most geographers regard this as the "Pharpar;" but the identification is uncertain, since the name may very possibly have attached to one of the branches of the Barada. The Barada is limpid, cool, gushing, the perfection of a river: It was known to the Greeks and Romans as the Chrysorrhoas, or "river of gold." We can well understand that Naaman would esteem the streams of his own city as infinitely superior to the turbid, often sluggish, sometimes "clay-colored" (Robinson, ' Researches,' ver. 2. p. 256) Jordan. If leprosy was to be trashed away, it might naturally have appeared to him that the pure Barada would have more cleansing power than the muddy river recommended to him by the prophet. <span class="cmt_word">So he turned and went away in a rage.</span>

"My father" is a deferential and, at the same time, an affectionate address, not unnatural in the mouth of a confidential servant (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>). There is thus no need of any alteration of the text, such as Ewald (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) or Thenius (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) proposes.

Naaman was persuaded.

It involved going out of his way at least fifty miles. At the Jordan, Naaman was on his way home, had accomplished a fourth part of his return journey; in three more days he would be in Damascus, in his own palace. But he feels that it would be an unworthy act to accept his cure and make no acknowledgment of it, having turned away from the prophet "in a rage" (ver. 12), now, without apology, or retraction, or expression of regret or gratitude, to return into his own country under the obligation of an inestimable benefit. His cure has wrought in him, not merely a revulsion of feeling from rage and fury to thankfulness, but a change of belief. It has convinced him that the God of Elisha is the God of the whole earth. It has turned him from a worshipper of Rimmon into a worshipper of Jehovah. He must proclaim this. He must let the prophet know what is in his heart. He must, if possible, induce him to accept a recompense. Therefore he thinks nothing of an outlay of time and trouble, but retraces his steps to the Israelite capital, taking with him all his company, his horses and his chariots, his gold and silver and bales of clothing, and numerous train of attendants. <span class="cmt_word">And came, and stood before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> descended from his chariot, and asked admittance into the prophet's house, and was received and allowed an audience - a striking contrast with his previous appearance before the house, in expectation that the prophet would come down and wait upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel.</span> This is an acknowledgment of the sole supremacy of Jehovah on the part of a heathen, such as we scarcely find elsewhere. The general belief of the time, and indeed of antiquity, was that every land had its own god, who was supreme in it - Baal in Phoenicia, Che-mesh in Moab, Moloch in Ammon, Rimmon in Syria, Bel or Bel-Merodach in Babylon, Amun-Ra in Egypt, etc.; and when there is an acknowledgment of Jehovah on the part of heathens in Scripture, it is almost always the recognition of him as a god - the God of the Jews or of the Israelites, one among many (see <a href="../../par/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-26.htm">2 Kings 17:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>, etc.). But here we have a plain and distinct recognition of him as the one and only God that is in all the earth. Naaman thus shows a greater docility, a readier receptivity, than almost any of the other pious heathens who are brought before us in Scripture. Balaam and Cyrus alone equal him. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a present" - <span class="cmt_word">of thy servant.</span> Heathens were accustomed to carry presents to the oracles which they consulted, and to reward those from which they received favorable responses with gifts of enormous value (see Herod., 1:14, 50, etc.). The Jewish prophets did net generally object to such free-will offerings. Naaman therefore quite naturally and reasonably made the offer. He would have contravened usage had he not done so. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a></div><div class="verse">But he said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.

It was not compulsory on him so to act; for the precept, "Freely ye have received, freely give" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>), had not been yet uttered. Pious Israelites commonly brought gifts to the prophets whom they consulted (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>). But, in the case of a foreigner, ignorant hitherto of true religion, whom it was important to impress favorably, and, if possible, win over to the faith, Elisha deemed it advisable to take no reward. Naaman was thus taught that Jehovah was his true Healer, the prophet the mere instrument, and that it was to Jehovah that his gratitude, his thanks, and his offerings were due. <span class="cmt_word">And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</span> Contests of politeness are common in the East, where the one party offers to give and even insists on giving, while the other makes a pretence of declining; but here both parties were in earnest, and the gift was absolutely declined. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-17.htm">2 Kings 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?</span> Naaman does not state what he intends to do with the earth; and the critics have consequently suggested two uses. Some suppose that he intended to make the earth into an altar upon which he might offer his sacrifices; comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>, where an altar of earth is spoken of (Bahr and others). But the more general opinion (Thenius, Von Gerlach, etc.) is that he wished to spread the earth over a piece of Syrian ground, and thereby to hallow the ground for purposes of worship. The Jews themselves are known to have acted similarly, transferring earth from Jerusalem to Babylonia, to build a temple on it; and the idea is not an unnatural one, It does not necessarily imply the "polytheistic superstition" that every god has his own laud, where alone he can be properly worshipped. It rests simply on the notion of there being such a thing as "holy ground" (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>) - ground more suited for the worship of God than ordinary common soil, which therefore it is worth while to transfer from place to place for a religious purpose. <span class="cmt_word">For thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice</span> [as meat offerings or firstfruits] <span class="cmt_word">unto other gods, but unto the Lord.</span> It is implied that Naaman had been hitherto a polytheist. Not much is known of the Syrian religion, but, so far as can be gathered, it would seem to have been a somewhat narrow polytheism. The sun was the supreme god, and was worshipped ordinarily under the name of Hadad (Ma-crob, 'Sat.,' 1:23). There was also, certainly, a great goddess, the "Dea Syra" of the Romans, whom they identified with Cybele and with their own "Bona Dea," a divinity parallel with the Ashtoreth of the Phoenicians, and the Ishtar of the Assyrians and Babylonians. Whether there were any other distinct deities may be doubted, since Bitumen is possibly only another name of Hadad (see the comment on ver. 18). Adonis is simply "Adonai," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my Lord," an epithet of the Supreme Being. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, <i>that</i> when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant.</span> Naaman is not prepared to be a martyr for his religion. On returning to Damascus, it will be among his civil duties to accompany his master to the national temples, and to prostrate himself before the images of the national deities. If he declines, if (like an early Christian) he will not enter "the house of devils," much less bow down before the graven image of a false god, it may cost him his life; it will certainly cost him his court favor. For such a sacrifice he is not prepared. Yet his conscience tells him that he will be acting wrongly. He therefore expresses a hope, or a prayer, that his fault, for a fault he feels that it will be, may be forgiven him - that Jehovah will not be "extreme to mark what is done amiss," but will excuse his outward conformity to his inward faith and zeal. That <span class="cmt_word">when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon.</span> Riminon is probably derived from <span class="accented">rum</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>), "to be high," and means "the exalted god," according to the gloss of He-sychins -  <span class="greek">&#x3a1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>.

The royal name, "Tab-Bitumen" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), contains the root, as does also the local name (<a href="../../par/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>), "Hadad-Rimmon." This last word gives rise to the suspicion that Hadad and Rimmon are merely two names of the same deity, who was called "Hadad" or "Hadar" as bright and glorious, "Rim-men" as lofty and exalted. <span class="cmt_word">To worship there, and he leaneth on my hand</span>. Either Naaman's leprosy must have been recent, and he refers to the king's practice in former times, or there must have been far less horror of leprosy among the Syrians than there was among the Hebrews. And I bow myself in the house of Rimmon - before the image, or at any rate before the supposed presence of the god - <span class="cmt_word">when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing.</span> The repetition of the clause indicates Naaman's anxiety on the subject.

He was not called upon to give an answer, since Naaman had not put a question, but had only expressed a wish. His Go in peace is to be taken simply as "wishing the departing Syrian the peace of God upon the road." So Keil, rightly. <span class="cmt_word">So he departed from him a little way.</span> Naaman left the presence of Elisha, quitted Samaria, and had gone a short way on his homeward journey when Gehazi overtook him.

This is partly because formulae by frequent use become mere forms, to which the utterer attaches no meaning; partly because men blind themselves to the wrongfulness of their actions, and find some excuse or other for any course of conduct by which they hope to profit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-21.htm">2 Kings 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw <i>him</i> running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, <i>Is</i> all well?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Gehazi followed after Naaman.</span> A company of travelers in the East, even though it consist of the retinue of a single great man, will always contain footmen, as well as those who ride on horses or in chariots, and will not travel at a faster pace than about three miles an hour. Thus Gehazi, if he went at his best speed, could expect to overtake, and did actually overtake, the cavalcade of Naaman. He probably overtook them at a very short distance from Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And when Naaman saw him running after him.</span> Gehazi was pressed for time. He could not start at once, lest he should make it too plain that he was going m pursuit of Naaman; and he could not absent himself from the house too long, lest his master should call for him. He had, therefore, at whatever loss of dignity, to hurry himself, and actually "run after" the Syrian. Naaman, either accidentally looking back, or warned by some of his train, sees him, recognizes him, and is only too glad to respond to his wishes. <span class="cmt_word">He lighted down from the chariot to meet him.</span> An act of great condescension. As Bahr notes, "Descent from a vehicle is, in the East, a sign of respect from the inferior to the superior;" and Naaman, in lighting down from his chariot, must have intended to "honor the prophet in his servant" ('Commentary on Kings,' vol. 2. p. 55). But such honor is not commonly paid, and thus the act of Naaman was abnormal. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Is all well?</span> The words admit of no better translation. Seeing Gehazi's haste and anxious looks, Naaman suspects that all is <span class="accented">not</span> well, that something has happened since he left the prophet's house, and accordingly puts his question, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5be;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>?

Gehazi had to balance between his own greed on the one hand, and the fear of raising suspicion on the other. His story was altogether most plausible, and his demand prudently moderate.

Once enter on the devious path, and you cannot say whither it will conduct you. To deceive and plunder a foreigner of a hostile nation probably seemed to Gehazi a trifle, either no sin at all, or a very venial sin. But now he finds himself led on to telling a direct lie to his master, which even he could not have justified to himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto him, Went not mine heart <i>with thee</i>, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? <i>Is it</i> a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee</span>? There is no "with thee" in the original; and the words have been taken in quite a different sense. Ewald regards <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, "my heart," as designating Gehazi, and meaning "my loved one, my favorite disciple." "Thou hast denied that thou wentest any whither; but did not my favorite disciple in truth go forth, when the man turned again from his chariot, as Naaman did?" (ver. 21). But no parallel instance can be adduced of any such use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, which is altogether too strong a term to be applied to a mere favorite servant. The irony, moreover, of the term under the circumstances would be too great. Maurer's interpretation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> by "my prophetic power" (my prophetic power had not departed from me) is no better, since it requires <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> to be taken in two different senses in the two most closely connected clauses of vers. 25 and 26. Altogether, our version would seem to be the best rendering that has been suggested. It accords with the Septuagint, with Theodoret, and with the Vulgate; and it gives a satisfactory sense: "Did not my spirit go forth with thee when thou wentest forth, etc.? Was I not present in spirit during the whole transaction?" <span class="cmt_word">When the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?</span> (see ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</span> The prophet follows Gehazi's thoughts, which had been to purchase, with the money obtained from Naaman, olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, etc.; and asks - Was this a time for such proceedings? Keil well explains, "Was this the time, when so many hypocrites pretend to be prophets from selfishness and avarice, and bring the prophetic office into contempt with unbelievers, for a servant of the true God to take money and goods from a non-Israelite... that he might acquire property and luxury for himself?" It was evidently a most unfit time. As Thenius says, "In any other case better than in this mightest thou have yielded to thy desire for gold and goods."

The "school of the prophets" at Jericho, whereof we heard in <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5, 19</a>, had increased so much, that the buildings which hitherto had accommodated it were no longer sufficient. A larger dwelling, or set of dwelling, was thought to be necessary; but the scholars would make no change without the sanction of their master.

Along the course of the Jordan trees and shrubs were abundant, chiefly willows, poplars, and tamarisks (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:08. &sect; 3; Strabo, 16:2. &sect; 41). It would seem that the Jordan thickets were unappropriated, and that any one might cut timber in them. <span class="cmt_word">And take thence every man a beam.</span> The meaning is, "Let us <span class="accented">all</span> join in the work, each cutting beams and carrying them; and the work will soon be accomplished." <span class="cmt_word">And let us make us a place there.</span> They propose to build the new dwelling on the banks of Jordan, to save the trouble of conveying the materials any long distance. <span class="cmt_word">Where we may dwell.

He, therefore, raised no difficulty, but at once, in the simplest manner, acceded to the request. There is a remarkable directness, simplicity, and absence of fuss in all that Elisha says and does.

As the man hewed away at the stem a little above the root, the axe-head flew from the haft, into which it was insecurely fitted, and fell into the water. The slipping of an axe-head was a very common occurrence (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>), and ordinarily was of little consequence, since it was easily restored to its place. But now the head had disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">And he cried, and said, Alas, master!</span> - rather, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my master</span>! or, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my lord</span>! - <span class="cmt_word">for it was borrowed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was a borrowed one</span>. The words are part of the man's address to Elisha. He means to say, "It is no common misfortune; it is not as if it had been my own axe. I had borrowed it, and now what shall I say to the owner?" There is no direct request for help, but the tone of the complaint constitutes a sort of silent appeal.

The sacred writers are not concerned to put on record mere acts of manual dexterity.

But it agrees better with the prophet's injunction, "Beware that thou <span class="accented">pass not</span> such a place," to suppose that he merely sent out scouts to see if the place were occupied or no, and finding, in each case, Elisha's warning true, he avoided the locality. <span class="cmt_word">Which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> repeatedly; at least three several times, perhaps more.

How the Syrian lord knew this, or whether he merely made a shrewd guess, we cannot say.

Dothan, the place where Joseph was sold by his brethren to the Ishmaelites (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-17.htm">Genesis 37:17</a>), lay evidently not very far from Shechem (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>), and is placed by Eusebius about twelve miles north of Samaria. In the Book of Judith (4:6; 7:3) it is mentioned among the cities bordering the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. Modern travelers (Van de Velde, Robinson) have reasonably identified it with the present <span class="accented">Dothan</span>, a tel, or hill, of a marked character, covered with ruins, and from the foot of which arises a copious spring, to the south-west of Jenin, between that place and Jeba, a little to the left of the great road leading from Beisan (Scythopolis) to Egypt.

His mental state required something like a material manifestation; and hence Elisha prays that he may be permitted to behold the angelic host, which everywhere throughout creation is employed at all times in doing the will of God, and accomplishing his ends (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, etc.).

Elisha meant the Syrians to understand him to say, "This is not the way which ye ought to have taken if ye wanted to capture the Prophet Elisha, and this is not the city (Dothan) where you were told that he was to be found." And so the Syrians understood him. In the morality of the time, and, indeed, in the morality of all times up to the present, it has been held to be justifiable to deceive a public enemy. <span class="cmt_word">Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.</span> It could only be through the miraculous delusion for which Elisha had prayed, and which had been sent, that the Syrians believed the first comer in an enemy's country, followed him to the capital without hesitation, and allowed him to bring them inside 'the walls. But for the delusion, they would have suspected, made inquiries of others, and retreated hastily, as soon as the walls and towers of Samaria broke on their sight.

Compare the use of the same expression by Joash (<a href="../../par/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), and the employment of the correlative term "son" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>) by Berthadad. <span class="cmt_word">Shall I smite them? shall I smite them?</span> The repetition marks extreme eagerness, while the interrogative form shows a certain amount of hesitation. It is certain that the Israelites were in the habit of putting to death their prisoners of war, not only when they were captured with arms in their hands, but even when they surrendered themselves. When a city or country was conquered, the whole male population of full age was commonly put to death (<a href="../../par/numbers/31-7.htm">Numbers 31:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>, etc.). When a third part was spared, it was from some consideration of relationship (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The Law distinctly allowed, if it did not even enjoin, the practice (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>). Jehoram, therefore, no doubt, put his prisoners of war to death under ordinary circumstances. But he hesitates now. He feels that the case is an extraordinary one, and that the prophet, who has made the capture, is entitled to be consulted on the subject. Hence his question.

His prohibition is absolute. These prisoners, at any rate, are not to be slain. "The object of the miracle," as Keil says, "would have been frustrated, if the Syrians had been slain.

There was also, perhaps, a further political object. By sparing the prisoners and treating them with kindness, it might be possible to touch the heart of the King of Syria, and dispose him towards peace. <span class="cmt_word">Wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Wouldest</span> thou be smiting those, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Wouldest thou, in smiting these persons, be smiting those whom thou hadst made prisoners in war, so as to be able to justify thy conduct by <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>?

Bahr supposes that the raids were discontinued simply "because the Syrians had found out that they could not accomplish anything by these expeditions, but rather brought themselves into circumstances of great peril" ('Commentary on Kings,' vol. it. p. 69). But the <span class="accented">nexus</span> of the clause, "So the bands," etc., rather implies that the cessation was the consequence of Jehoram's sparing and entertaining the captives.

Artaxerx.,' &sect; 24), where an ass's head was sold for sixty drachmas (about forty shillings). "Dove's dung" is thought by some to be the name of a plant; but it is better to understand the term literally. Both animal and human excrement have been eaten in sieges (Josephus, ' Bell.

He wore sackcloth next his skin, no one suspecting it, until, in the exasperation of his feelings at the woman's tale, he rent his robe, and exposed to view the sackcloth which underlay it. We are scarcely entitled to deny him any true penitential feeling, though no doubt he was far from possessing a chastened or humble spirit. Poor weak humanity has at one and the same time good and evil impulses, praiseworthy and culpable feelings, thoughts which come from the Holy Spirit of God, and thoughts which are inspired by the evil one.

It was an imprecation of evil on one's self, if one did, or if one failed to do, a certain thing. Why Jehoram should have considered Elisha as responsible for all the horrors of the siege is not apparent; but perhaps he supposed that it was in Elisha's power to work a miracle of any kind at any moment that he liked. If so, he misunderstood the nature of the miraculous gift. In threatening to behead Elisha, he is not making himself an executor of the Law, which nowhere sanctioned that mode of punishment, but assuming the arbitrary power of the other Oriental monarchs of his time, who regarded themselves as absolute masters of the lives and liberties of their subjects. Beheading was common in Egypt, in Babylonia, and in Assyria.

Elisha had a house in Samaria, where he ordinarily resided, and from which he made his circuits. He happened to be sitting there, and the elders of the city to be sitting with him, when Jehoram sent "a man from before him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of the court officials, to put him to death. The "elders" had probably assembled at Elisha's house to consult with him on the critical situation of affairs, and (if possible) obtain from him some miraculous assistance. <span class="cmt_word">But ere the messenger came to him; he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head</span>; Elisha was supernaturally warned of what was about to take place - that an executioner was coming almost immediately to take away his life, and that the king himself would arrive shortly after. He calls the king "this son of a murderer," or rather "this son of <span class="accented">the</span> murderer," with reference to Ahab, the great murderer of the time, who had sanctioned all Jezebel's cruelties-the general massacre of the prophets of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>), the judicial murder of Naboth (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9-13</a>), the attempt to kill Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>) - and had, by a fierce and long continued persecution, reduced the worshippers of Jehovah in Israel to the scanty number of seven thousand (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). Jehoram had now shown that he inherited the bloodthirsty disposition of his father, and had justly earned the epithet which Elisha bestowed on him. <span class="cmt_word">Look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door.</span> Keil renders the last clause, "force him back at the door;" the LXX.

He could not in a general way have expected them to resist the king's will as declared by his representative; but he might reasonably ask a short respite, if the king was just about to arrive at the house, to confirm the order that he had given, or to revoke it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-33.htm">2 Kings 6:33</a></div><div class="verse">And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil <i>is</i> of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he yet talked with them</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, while Elisha yet talked with the elders, endeavoring probably to persuade them to stop the messenger - <span class="cmt_word">behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said.</span> The narrative is very compressed and elliptical.

The reader is expected to supply missing links, and to understand that all happened as Elisha had predicted and enjoined - that the messenger came, that the elders stopped him, and that the king shortly arrived. The king was, of course, admitted, and, being admitted, took the word, and said, <span class="cmt_word">Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what</span> - rather, <span class="accented">why - <span class="cmt_word"></span>should I wait for the Lord any longer?</span> Jehoram had, apparently, to some extent repented of his hasty message, and had hurried after his messenger, to give Elisha one further chance of life. We must understand that they had been in communication previously on the subject of the siege, and that Elisha had encouraged the king to "wait for" an interposition of Jehovah. The king now urges that the time for waiting is over; matters are at the last gasp; "this evil" this terrible suffering which can no longer be endured - "is of the Lord," has come from him, is continued by him, and is not relieved. What use is there in his "waiting" any longer? Why should he not break with Jehovah, behead the lying prophet, and surrender the town?

It must be remembered that the prophet's life was trembling in the balance. The executioner was present; the king had not revoked his order; the elders would probably have suffered the king to work his will. All depended on Elisha, by half a dozen words, changing the king's mind. He therefore announces a Divine oracle (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>; and for the exact expression, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-4.htm">Jeremiah 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure</span> - literally, a <span class="accented">seah</span> - of fine flour be sold for a shekel. The "seah" was probably about equal to a peck and a half English, the shekel of the time to about half a crown. Thus no extraordinary cheapness is promised, but only an enormous fall in prices from the rate current at the moment (2 Kings 7:25). Such a fall implied, almost necessarily, the discontinuance of the siege. Jehoram appears to have accepted the prophet's solemn asseveration, and on the strength of it to have spared his life, at any rate till the result should be seen. <span class="cmt_word">And two measures</span> - literally, <span class="accented">seahs - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</span> The gates, or rather gateways, of Oriental towns were spacious places, where business of various kinds was transacted. One at Nineveh had an area of above two thousand five hundred square feet. Kings often held their courts of justice in the city gates. On this occasion one of the gates of Samaria seems to have been used as a corn-market (comp. vers. 17-20).

Hence Elisha's stern reply. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</span> At once a threat and a warning. If the thing was to be, and the lord to see it and yet not profit by it, the only reasonable conclusion was that his death was imminent. He was thus warned, and given time to "set his house in order," and to repent and make his peace with the Almighty. Whether he took advantage of the warning, or even understood it, we are not told.

Four lepers, excluded from the city, and on the point of perishing of hunger, felt that they could be no worse off, and might better their condition, if they deserted to the Syrians. They therefore drew off from the city at nightfall, and made for the Syrian camp. On arriving, they found it deserted. The entire host, seized with a sudden panic, had fled, about the time that they began their journey. The lepers' first thought was to enrich themselves by plunder, but after a while it occurred to them that, unless they hastened to carry the good news to Samaria, inquiry would be made, their proceedings would be found out, and they would be severely punished. So they returned to the capital, and reported what they had discovered. Jehoram, on receiving the news, feared that the Syrians had prepared a trap for him, and declined to move. He consented, however, to send out scouts to reconnoiter. The scouts found evident proof that the entire army had actually fled and was gone, whereupon there was a general raid upon the camp and its stores, which were so abundant that Elisha's prophecy was fulfilled ere the day ended. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate</span>; or, at the <span class="accented">entrance to the gate-house</span>.

They were thrust out when the disease developed itself, and forced to dwell without the walls. No doubt their friends within the city ordinarily supplied them with food; and hence they congregated about the city gates. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</span> In the extreme scarcity, it is probable that no food was brought to them, the inmates of the city having barely enough wherewith to sustain themselves (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>).

A noise like that of chariots and of horses and of a great host (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) was borne in upon the ears of the Syrians about nightfall of the day on which Jehoram had determined to put Elisha to death; and, as they expected no reinforcements, they naturally concluded that succor had arrived to help their enemy. How the noise was produced it is impossible to say. Na-rural causes are insufficient; and the writer evidently regards the event as miraculous: "The <span class="accented">Lord had made</span> the host of the Syrians to hear a noise," etc. Nothing can be more weak and irrelevant than to remark, with Bahr," There are instances, even nowadays, that people in certain mountainous regions regard a rushing and roaring sound, such as is sometimes heard there, as a sign of coming war." The Syrians thought they heard the actual arrival of a vast army. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Lo, the King of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites.</span> This supposition has been thought "strange," almost inexplicable. "No such nation as the Hittites any longer existed," says Mr. Sumner ('The Books of the Kings,' vol. 2. p. 72, Eng. trans.). But the Assyrian records of the  <span class="date">ninth and eighth centuries B.C.</span> make it evident, not only that the Hittites still existed at that date, but that they were among the most powerful enemies of the Ninevite kings, being located in Northern Syria, about Carchemish (Jerabus) and the adjacent country. It is also apparent that they did not form a centralized monarchy, but were governed by a number of chiefs, or "kings," twelve of whom are mentioned in one place (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 112). It was no very improbable supposition on the part of the Syrians that Jehoram had called in the aid of the Hittite confederacy, and that they had marched an army to his assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the Egyptians.</span> "The plural, kings of the Egyptians," says Keil, "is not to be pressed. It is probably occasioned only by the parallel expression,' kings of the Hittites.'" But Egyptian history shows us that about this date Egypt was becoming disintegrated, and that two or three distinct dynasties were sometimes ruling at the same time, in different parts of the country - one at Bubastis another at Thebes, a third at Tanis, occasionally a fourth at Memphis (see "Ancient Egypt," in 'The Story of the Nations,' p. 311). The writer thus shows a knowledge of the internal condition of Egypt which we should not have expected. To come upon us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to fall upon us from the north and from the south at the same time. In their panic, the Syrians did not stop to weigh probabilities, or to think how unlikely it was that such a simultaneous attack could have been arranged between powers so remote one from the other.

So Darius Hystaspis, when he began his retreat from Scythia (Herod., 4:135), left his camp standing, and the camp fires lighted, and the asses tethered (see ver. 10), that the Scythians, seeing the tents and hearing the noise of the animals, might be fully persuaded that his troops were still in the same place. Asses were the chief baggage-animals in many ancient armies. <span class="cmt_word">And fled for their life.</span> Thinking that, if they waited till dawn, the Israelite allies, Hittites and Egyptians, would exterminate them.

Then their covetousness was excited by the riches exposed to view in the tent. <span class="cmt_word">And carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment.</span> Oriental armies carried with them vast quantities of the precious metals, in the shape of gold and silver vases, goblets, dishes, as well as in collars, chains, furniture, and trappings. Herodotus says (9:80) that, when the camp of Mardonius at Plataea fell into the hands of the Greeks, there were found in it "many tents richly adorned with furniture of gold and silver, many couches covered with plates of the same, and many golden bowls, goblets, and other drinking-vessels. On the carriages were bags containing gold and silver kettles; and the bodies of the slain furnished bracelets and chains, and scimitars with golden ornaments - not to mention era-broidered apparel, of which no one made any account." The camp of the Syrians would scarcely have been so richly provided; but still it contained, no doubt, a large amount of very valuable plunder. <span class="cmt_word">And went and hid it.</span> The lepers had no right to the pick of the spoil. It belonged to the nation, and it was probably the king's right to apportion it. The lepers had to conceal what they appropriated, lest it should he taken from them. <span class="cmt_word">And came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.</span> Plundering thus probably, not two tents only, but several. At last, either covetousness was satiated or conscience awoke.

Their fellow-countrymen in the city of Samaria were perishing of hunger, mothers eating their children, and the like, while they employed hour after hour in collecting and hiding away their booty.

He supposed that the enemy had merely gone a little way from their camp, and placed themselves in ambush, ready to take ad- vantage of any rash movement which the Israelites might make.

Elisha, on its approach, recommended the Shunammite, though she was a woman of substance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>), to quit her home and remove to some other residence, where she mighty, escape the pressure of the calamity He left it to her to choose the place of her temporary abode. The phrase, "God hath <span class="accented">called for</span> a famine," means no more and no less than "God has determined that there shall be a famine." With God to speak the word is to bring about the event. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall also come upon the land seven years.</span> Seven years was the actual duration of the great famine, which Joseph foretold in Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>), and was the ideally perfect period for a severe famine (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>). Many of the best meteorologists are inclined to regard the term of "seven years" as a cyclic period in connection with weather changes.

There were still those to whom the prophet was the mouthpiece of God, who waited on his words, and accepted them as Divine commands whereto they were ready to render immediate and entire obedience. It is conjectured by some that the woman had become a widow, and fallen into comparative poverty; but the narrative gives no indication of this. Even opulent persons have to migrate in times of severe dearth. <span class="cmt_word">And she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the philistines.</span> Philistia was a great grain country (<a href="../../par/judges/15-5.htm">Judges 15:5</a>), and, though not altogether exempt from famine, was less exposed to it than either Judaea or Samaria. The soil was exceedingly fertile, and the vapors from the Mediterranean descended upon it in clews and showers, when their beneficial influence was not felt further inland. The Shunammite may have had other reasons for fixing her residence in the Philistine country; but probably she was chiefly determined in her choice by its proximity and its productiveness.

Her own land, where she could have the ministrations of a "man of God" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), was dear to her; and no sooner had the famine abated than she returned to it. <span class="cmt_word">And she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</span> During her prolonged absence, some grasping neighbor had seized on the unoccupied house and the uncultivated estate adjoining it, and now refused to restore them to the rightful owner. Widows were especially liable to such treatment on the part of greedy oppressors, since they were, comparatively speaking, weak and defenseless (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>). Under such circumstances the injured party would naturally, in an Oriental country, make appeal to the king (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-4.htm">2 Samuel 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-26.htm">2 Kings 6:26</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king talked with Gehazi</span>; rather, <span class="accented">now the king was talking with Gehazi</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the Revised Version. The king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, happened to be talking with Gehazi at the moment when the woman came into his presence and "cried" to him. It has been reasonably concluded from this, that chronological order is not observed in the portion of the narrative which treats of Elisha and his doings, since a king of Israel would scarcely be in familiar conversation with a leper (Keil). It may be added that Gehazi can scarcely have continued to be the servant of Elisha, as he evidently now was, after his leprosy. He must have dwelt "without the gate." <span class="cmt_word">The servant of the man of God.</span> That a king should converse with a servant is, no doubt, somewhat unusual; but, as Bahr notes, there is nothing in the circumstance that need astonish us. It is natural enough that, having been himself a witness of so many of the prophet's marvelous acts done in public, Jehoram should become curious concerning those other marvelous acts which he had performed in private, among his personal friends and associates, with respect to which many turnouts must have got abroad; and should wish to obtain an account of them from a source on which he could rely. If he had this desire, he could scarcely apply to the prophet himself, with whom he was at no time on familiar terms, and who would shrink from enlarging on his own miraculous powers. "To whom, then, could he apply with more propriety for this information than to the prophet's familiar servant" - an eye-witness of most of them, and one who would have no reason for reticence? Oriental ideas would not be shocked by the king's sending for any subject from whom he desired information, and questioning him. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</span> Miracles are often called "great things" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) in the Old Testament, but generally in connection with God as the doer of them (see <a href="../../par/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-10.htm">Job 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-5.htm">Job 37:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/71-19.htm">Psalm 71:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-21.htm">Psalm 106:21</a>, etc.).

As an eye-witness (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29-36</a>), he could give all the details. <span class="cmt_word">That, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.</span> The coincidence can scarcely have been accidental. Divine providence so ordered matters that, just when the king's interest in the woman was most warm, she should appear before him to urge her claim. At another time, Jehoram would, it is probable, have been but slightly moved by her complaint. Under the peculiar circumstances, he was deeply moved, and at once granted the woman the redress for which she asked. <span class="cmt_word">And Gehazi said, Wry lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> The Shunammite was accompanied by her son, now a boy of at least tea or eleven years old - the actual object of Elisha's miracle. The king's interest in the woman would be still more roused by this circumstance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-6.htm">2 Kings 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when the king asked the woman, she told him.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-7.htm">2 Kings 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-15.</span> <span class="accented">- Elisha's visit to Damascus</span>, <span class="accented">and its consequences</span>. It has been usual to connect this visit of Elisha's to Damascus with the commission given to Elijah many years previously, to anoint Hazael to be king over Syria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). But it is certainly worthy of remark that neither is Elijah authorized to devolve his corn-mission on another, nor is he said to have done so, nor is there any statement in the present narrative or elsewhere that Elisha anointed Hazael. It is therefore quite possible that Elisha's journey was wholly unconnected with the command given to Elijah. It may, as Ewald imagines, have been the consequence of disorders and dangers in Samaria, growing out of the divergence of views between Jehoram and the queen-mother Jezebel, who still retained considerable influence over the government; and Elisha may have taken his journey, not so much for the sake of a visit, as of a prolonged sojourn. That he attracted the attention both of Benhadad and of his successor Hazael is not surprising. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha came to Damascus.</span> It was a bold step, whatever the circumstances that led to it. Not very long previously the Syrian king had made extraordinary efforts to capture Elisha, intending either to kin him or to keep him confined as a prisoner (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18-19</a>). Elisha had subsequently helped to baffle his plans of conquest, and might be thought to have caused the disgraceful retreat of the Syrian army from the walls of Samaria, which he had certainly prophesied (<a href="../../par/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>). But Elisha was not afraid. He was probably <span class="accented">commissioned</span> to take his journey, whether its purpose was the anointing of Hazael or no. <span class="cmt_word">And Benhadad the King of Syria was sick.</span> Ewald supposes that this "sickness" was the result of the disgrace and discredit into which he had fallen since his ignominious retreat, without assignable reason, from before the walls of Samaria; but Ben-hadad must have been of an age When the infirmities of nature press in upon a man, and when illness has to be expected. He was a contemporary of Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), who had now been dead ten or twelve years. <span class="cmt_word">And it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</span> Elisha seems to have attempted no concealment of his presence. No sooner was he arrived than his coming was reported to Benhadad. The Syrians had by this time learnt to give him the name by which he was commonly known (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 21, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2, 18</a>) in Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-8.htm">2 Kings 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto Hazael.</span> It is implied that Hazael was in attendance on Benhadad in his sick-room, either permanently as a chamberlain, or occasionally as a minister. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:4. &sect; 6), he was "the most faithful of the king's domestics" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). We cannot presume from ver. 12 that he had as yet distinguished himself as a warrior. <span class="cmt_word">Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God.</span> It was usual, both among the heathen and among the Israelites, for those who consulted a prophet to bring him a present (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>). Hence, mainly, the great wealth of the Delphic and other oracles. Naaman (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>) had brought with him a rich present when he went to consult Elisha in Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And inquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease!</span> The miracles of Elisha had had at any rate this effect - they had convinced the Syrians that Jehovah was a great and powerful God, and made them regard Elisha himself as a true prophet. Their faith in their own superstitions must have been at least partially shaken by these convictions. It was by these and similar weakenings of established errors that the world was gradually educated, and the way prepared for the introduction of Christianity. There was very early among the Syrians a flourishing Christian Church.

Orientals are guilty of extreme ostentation with respect to the presents that they make. As Chardin says, "Fifty persons often carry what a single one could have very well borne" ('Voyage en Perse,' vol. 3. p. 217). The practice is illustrated by the bas-reliefs of Nineveh and Persepolis, which furnish proofs of its antiquity. One present-bearer carries a few pomegranates; another, a bunch of grapes; a third, a string of locusts; a fourth, two small ointment-pots; a fifth, a branch of an olive tree, and the like (Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pls. 8, 9, etc.). It is not unlikely that a single camel could have carried the whole. <span class="cmt_word">And earns and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad King of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying</span> - Benhadad seeks to propitiate Elisha by calling himself his son, thus indicating the respect he feels for him (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I recover of this disease?</span> Nothing was more common in the ancient world than the consultation of an oracle or a prophet in cases of disease or other bodily affliction. Two questions were commonly asked, "Shall I recover?" and "How may I recover?" So Pheron of Egypt is said to have consulted an oracle with respect to his blindness (Herod., 2:111), and Battus of Cyrene to have done the same with respect to his stammering (ibid., 4:155). It was seldom that a clear and direct answer was given.

Hazael does not accuse Elisha of making him out a dog in the future, but calls himself a dog in the present. "Dog" is a word of extreme contempt - "the most contemptuous epithet of abuse" (Winer), as appears, among other places, from <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a>.

A death of the same kind is recorded in the Persian history entitled 'Kholasat el Akhbar,' which contains (p. 162) the following passage: "The malik ordered that they should place a carpet on Abdallah's mouth, so that his life was cut off." <span class="cmt_word">And spread it on his face, so that he died.</span> It has been supposed by some commentators, as Luther, Schultz, Geddes, Boothroyd, that Benhadad put the wet <span class="accented">macber</span> on his own face for refreshment, and accidentally suffocated himself; but this is very unlikely, and it is certainly not the natural sense of the words. As "Hazael" is the subject of "departed" and "came" and "answered" in ver. 14, so it is the natural subject of "took" and "dipped" and "spread" in ver. 15. Ver. 11 also would be unintelligible if Hazael entertained no murderous intentions. Why Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 93, Eng. trans.) introduces a "bath-servant," unmentioned in the text, to murder Benhadad for no assignable reason, it is difficult to conjecture. <span class="cmt_word">And Hazael reigned in his stead.</span> The direct succession of Hazael to Benhadad is confirmed by the inscription on the Black Obelisk, where he appears as King of Damascus (line 97) a few years only after Benhadad (<span class="accented">Bin-idri</span>) had been mentioned as king.

(On the nature of this worship, see the ' Commentary on the First Book of Kings,' p. 374.) The "house of Ahab" maintained and spread the Baal-worship, wherever it had influence. Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, championed it in Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-53.htm">1 Kings 22:53</a>); Jehoram, his brother, allowed its continuance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>); Jehoram of Judah was induced by his wife, Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, to countenance it in Judaea; Athaliah, when she usurped the throne upon the death of her son Ahaziah, made it the state religion in that country. "Evil communications corrupt good manners." The alliance of the two separated kingdoms, concluded between Jehoshaphat and Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>), had no tangible result beyond the introduction into Judah of the licentious and debasing superstition which had previously overspread the sister country. <span class="cmt_word">For the daughter of Ahab was his wife.</span> In ver. 26 Athaliah, the wife of Jehoram, is called "the daughter of Omri;" but by "daughter" in that place must be meant "descendant" or "granddaughter."

Shortly after his accession he put to death his six brothers - Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Ahaziah (?), Michael, and Shephatiah - in order to "strengthen himself." At the same time, he caused many of the "princes of Israel" to be executed. Soon afterwards he "made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to become idolaters), "and compelled Judah thereto."

God had declared by Moses, "If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of  the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his  commandments and statutes, which I command thee this day; all these curses shall come upon thee  The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in  all that thou settest thine hand unto for to  do, <span class="accented">until thou be destroyed</span>, and until thou  perish quickly; because of the wickedness  of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken  me.

Thou shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-37</a>). The apostasy of Jeheram, and of the nation under him, was calculated to bring about the immediate fulfillment of all these threats, and would have done so but for a restraining cause. God had made promises to David, and to his seed after him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29-37</a>, etc.), which would be unfulfilled if Judah's candlestick were at once removed. He had declared, "If thy children forsake my Law, and walk not in my statutes... I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges. Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take away, nor suffer my truth to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips; I have sworn once by my holiness that I will not fail David." If he had now swept away the Jewish kingdom, he would have dealt more hardly with these who clave to David than with those that broke off from him. He would not have shown the "faithfulness" or the "mercy" which he had promised, he would have forgotten "the loving-kindnesses which he aware unto David in his truth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-49.htm">Psalm 89:49</a>). Therefore he would not - he <span class="accented">could</span> not  - as yet "destroy Judah," with which, in point of fact, he bore for above three centuries longer, until at last the cup of their iniquities was full, and "there was no remedy." <span class="cmt_word">As he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.</span> There is no "and" in the original.

On the death of David, Edom seems to have revolted under a prince named Hadad, and to have re-established its independence. It had been again sub-jeered by the time of Jehoshaphat, who appointed a governor over it (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and treated it as a portion of his own territories (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>). Now the yoke was finally thrown off, as had been prophesied (<a href="../../par/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>). Edom became once more a separate kingdom, and was especially hostile to Judah. In the reign of Ahaz the Edomites "smote Judah" and carried away many captives (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). When the Chaldaeans attacked and besieged Jerusalem, they cried, "Down with it, down with it, even to the ground!" (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). They looked on with joy at the capture of the holy city (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>), and "stood in the crossway, to cut off such as escaped" (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>). After the return from the Captivity, they were still Judah's enemies, and am especially denounced as such by the Prophet Malachi (<a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3-5</a>). In the Maccabee wars, we find them always on the Syrian side (1 Mac. 4:29, 61 1 Mac. 5:3 1 Mac. 6:31; 2 Macc. 10:15, etc.), doing their best to rivet the hateful yoke of the heathen on their suffering brethren.

The writer of Chronicles says, "two and forty" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>), which is absolutely impossible, since his father was but forty when he died (see ver. 17, and setup. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5, 20</a>). Even "two and twenty" is a more advanced age than we should have expected, since Ahaziah was the youngest of Jehoram's sons (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>); he must therefore have been born in his father's nineteenth year. Yet he had several elder brothers (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>)!

He was, no doubt, regarded of a sort of second founder of the kingdom of Israel, having been the first monarch to establish anything like a stable dynasty. His "statutes" were looked upon as the fundamental laws of the kingdom, and were "kept" down to the time of its destruction (<a href="../../par/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>).

He is the only Israelite king mentioned by name on the Moabite Stone (line 5), and the earliest mentioned in the inscriptions of Assyria. Even Jehu, who put an end to his dynasty, was regarded by the Assyrians as his descendant, and known under the designation of" Yahua, the son of Khnmri" (Black Obelisk, epig. 2.). Athallah, the daughter of Ahab, is called "the daughter of Omri," not only in the present passage, but also in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>.

For any other end, and done otherwise than at God's express command, such an act is sin. Jehu was rewarded for the measure in which he fulfilled God's commands, as Ahab, 'who had sold himself to work wickedness,' had yet a temporal reward for humbling himself publicly, when rebuked by God for his sin, and so honoring God, amid an apostate people. But Jehu, by cleaving, against the will of God, to Jeroboam's sin (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29, 31</a>), which served his own political ends, showed that, in the slaughter of his master, he acted, not as he pretended, out of zeal for the will of God (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-16.htm">2 Kings 10:16</a>), but served his own will and his own ambition only.

To an Israelite, and even to a Phoenician, it was an awful threat; for both nations alike buried their dead carefully in deep-dug graves or rocky receptacles, and both regarded the desecration of a corpse as a grievous calamity ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 112,114).

But "Jezebel had none to bury her." When she was ejected from the palace window (ver. 33) and fell to the ground, and was trodden under foot by Jehu's chariot-horses, no one came forth from the palace to give the bruised and wounded corpse such tendance as was possible. There was entire neglect of the body for (probably) some hours; and, during these, the catastrophe occurred which Divine foresight had prophesied, but which human malice had not intended (see vers. 34-37). <span class="cmt_word">And he opened the door, and fled.</span> The young man the prophet obeyed to the letter the injunctions which Elisha had given him (ver. 3).

It is reasonably conjectured (Bahr) that "a deep dissatisfaction with Joram must have prevailed in the <span class="accented">army</span>," though whether the dissatisfaction arose from the idolatry of the house of Ahab, or from Joram's withdrawal from the war, may be doubted, Jehu, on the ether hand, was evidently highly esteemed. The captains threw themselves with ardor into his cause, and extemporized a sort of enthronement. As often in an Oriental house, an external staircase led from the court to the upper story or to the roof. This they carpeted with their <span class="accented">begeds</span>, or outer cloaks, and, seating him on the top stair, saluted him as actual king. The expression, <span class="accented">el-gerem ham-ma'aloth</span>, is not literally, "on the <span class="accented">top</span> of the stairs," but rather "on the stairs <span class="accented">themselves</span>."

Secrecy was absolutely essential. If the revolt had got wind - and a single messenger might have carried the news - the whole attempt might have failed, or only have succeeded after a long and bloody civil war. All John's efforts were bent on keeping his revolt secret until he himself announced it to the astonished king (see ver. 22).

Jehu, with a moderate troop or company (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), sets out, perhaps on the very day of his enthronement, and hastens with all speed to Jezreel, bent on arriving there before any suspicion has arisen of revolt or rebellion. His great object was to surprise Joram, and to kill or capture him before he could take any steps to organize a defense. Probably the force which accompanied him was wholly a chariot force. <span class="cmt_word">And Ahaziah King of Judah was come down to see Joram</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a>, and the comment A.D. loc).

If the "company" had been a band of Syrians, or other enemies, coming in hostile fashion, the watchman would have worded his warning differently.

Had the king started a little sooner, or had Jehu made less haste, the meeting would have taken place further from the town, and outside the "portion of Naboth." But Divine providence so ordered matters that vengeance for the sin of Ahab was exacted upon the very scene of his guilt, and a prophecy made, probably by Elisha, years previously, and treasured up in the memory of Jehu (ver. 26), was fulfilled to the letter.

Jehu recalls his captain's recollection to an occurrence which was deeply impressed upon his own. "When thou and I rode together after Ahab" probably means "when we two stood behind Ahab in his chariot." The Assyrian sculptures usually represent the monarch as attended by two body-guards, who ride in the same chariot with him, standing up behind him, and often interposing their shields to protect his person. In this near proximity Jehu and Bidkar would hear any speech which was addressed to Ahab.

In this case "Beth-Gan" would be a village or town, probably identical with En-gannim, which lay at the foot of the hills bounding the Plain of Esdraelon, nearly due south of Jezreel (Zerin), and which is now known as Jenin (see the Map of Western Palestine, by Mr. Trelawney Saunders, compiled from the surveys of the Palestine Exploration Fund, where Ahaziah's flight is well traced. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu followed after him; and said, Smite him also in the chariot</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his chariot</span>, not in that of Jehoram, since the two kings rode respectively in their own chariots (ver. 21). It was a bold step in a pretender not yet settled upon the throne to provoke the hostility of a neighboring country by murdering its monarch; but Jehu probably thought he had more to fear from Ahaziah himself, who had been on such close terms of friendship with Jehoram, than from any probable successors. He, therefore, finding him in his power, pursued after him and slew him. From a religious point of view he could justify the act; since the commission given to him (ver. 7) was to smite all the house of Ahab, and Ahaziah was Ahab's grandson. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. The "ascent of Gur," <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5be;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, was probably the rising ground between the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraslon and the place known as" Ibleam," or "Bileam" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>), which is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Bir-el-Belameh</span>, two miles south of Jenin.

The reconciliation of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-8.htm">2 Chronicles 12:8, 9</a> with the present passage is difficult, but not wholly impossible. Perhaps the Chronicler means by "Samaria" the kingdom, not the town.

But it is certainly more natural to understand (with Keil and Josephus) that Jehu himself pursued. The pursuit to Ibleam, where Ahaziah was mortally wounded, and the return to Jezreel, need not have occupied more than about three hours. <span class="cmt_word">Jezebel heard of it.</span> She would naturally be the first to hear. On the death of her son, which must have been plainly seen from the walls of Jezreel, she become practically the chief authority in the place, and indeed in the kingdom. Jehoram's sons were probably minors. <span class="cmt_word">And she painted her face</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and she put her eyes in antimony</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she adorned her eyes with the dark dye which has always been fashionable in the East, and which is still used at the present day. The dye is spread both on the upper and the lower eyelids. It at once increases the apparent size of the eye, and gives it unnatural brilliancy. The Oriental nations, Babylonians, Assyrians, Medes, Persians, were acquainted with the practice from very early times; and it is not surprising that it was known to Jezebel. What was her exact object in applying it is more doubtful. The older commentators, who are followed by Ewald, suppose that she intended to "summon up all her seductive fascinations in order to tempt and conquer Jehu;" but more recent writers (Bahr, Keil, and others) argue that her probable age renders this incredible, since she had already a grandson who was twenty-three years of age (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>), and must therefore have been herself at least fifty. But, if we remember that Cleopatra was forty when She held Antony as her slave and hoped to captivate Augustus, it would seem to be not altogether beyond the bounds of possibility that a Phoouician princess of fifty may have thought that, by the use of art, she might reader herself a captivating personage. There is, at any rate no evidence that "putting the eyes in antimony" was an ordinary or a fitting preparation for meeting death in a way worthy of a queen. Ewald's view has, therefore much to commend it to our acceptance. Jezebel, trusting in the charms and the fascination which had been so potent over Ahab, may have imagined that she had still enough beauty left to capture Jehu, provided she increased her natural attractions by a careful use of all the resources of art. <span class="cmt_word">And tired her head.</span> Phoenician statues of goddesses have their hair arranged in long pendent curls, and bear on their heads a small conical cap with a ribbon wreathed round the base. The artists probably had queens and princesses as their models. There is no evidence that false hair was worn in Phoenicia, either by men or women. <span class="cmt_word">And looked out at a window.</span> Windows, sometimes open, sometimes latticed, were common in Oriental houses from the earliest times. They mostly looked into the court round which a house was commonly built; but some few were in the external wall of the building; and through these new arrivals might be reconnoitered. Jezebel "looked out," partly to see, but perhaps still more to be seen.

But so defiant an utterance is quite incompatible within intention to captivate and conciliate. Probably, therefore, we should understand the queen either as saying affirmatively, "Peace to thee, Zimri!" (or, "Hail, Zimri!") "slayer of thy lord," or else as asking, "Is it peace" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Is it peace now between thee and me?"), Zimri, slayer of thy lord?" In either case, Zimri is an honorific appellation, recalling the fact of another Israelite general, who had revolted, slain his master, and reigned as king.

He had made up his mind for "war to the knife" before he embarked upon his enterprise, and the feeble attempts of a queen whose part was played out, whose age he knew, and whom he no doubt regarded as an old woman, had no power on him. Instead of responding to her blandishments, he took a stern and hard line. He would not see her privately. He summoned to his aid the menials of the palace - the eunuchs -those on whom beauty has least influence. "Who is on my side? <span class="accented">who</span>?" he exclaimed (literally, "Who is with me? who?"); thus calling on the court servants to desert their masters, the guards to turn their swords against their employers, the menials to consummate an intra-palatial revolution. We cannot deny to Jehu the credit of vigor, promptness, audacity, the talent to seize on the opportunity of the moment, and to make the most of it; but he must ever present himself to us as the rough soldier, with no courtesy, with no chivalry, bent on accomplishing his own ends, and shrinking from no deed of blood, no precedent <span class="accented">pessimi exempli</span>, if thereby his ends might be brought about. <span class="cmt_word">And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</span> Eunuchs had become an integral part both of the Jewish and of the Israelite courts from the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>). They are an institution which almost necessarily accompanies polygamy; and they had long held high office in. Egypt, in Babylon, and in Assyria. A position outside nature, at variance with all men's natural feelings and aspirations, of necessity depraves the character, weakens the moral principle, and ends by debasing the class. In Oriental history, the lowest, vilest part is always played by the eunuchs of the palace, who are ever ready to take part in any intrigues, in any conspiracies, and who seem to be almost wholly devoid of the ordinary feelings of humanity. The eunuchs who "looked out" to Jehu were probably the <span class="accented">chief</span> eunuchs of the palace, who had authority over the others, and indeed over the court officials generally.

A queen, a queen-mother, always more tenderly regarded than an ordinary queen-regnant, a princess in her own right (see ver. 34), daughter of a neighboring and powerful potentate, settled in her kingdom for over thirty years, the most powerful person the state during that entire period, backed up by the numerous and dominant party of her co-religionists, she is to Jehu nothing but a wicked woman who is in his way; she inspires him with no awe, she does not even touch him with any feeling of respect. "Throw her down." History presents no parallel to such an indignity. Kings and queens had been, time after time, removed by violence; their lives had been taken; they had been transplanted to another sphere of being. But the open casting forth from a window of a crowned head by the menials of the court, at the command of a usurper, was a new thing, unprecedented, unparalleled. It must have been a shock to all established notions of propriety. In commanding it Jehu showed his superiority to existing prejudice, his utter fearlessness, and his willingness to create a new precedent, which might seriously shake the monarchical principle. <span class="cmt_word">So they threw her down.</span> There appears to have been no hesitation. The boldness of Jehu communicated itself to those whom he addressed; and the eunuchs violently seized the person of the queen, and precipitated her from the window to the ground below. She fell on the road by which the palace was approached, and lay there bleeding and helpless. <span class="cmt_word">And some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall.</span> As she fell, some portion of her body struck against the wall of the palace, and left splashes of blood upon it. There were probably some projections from the wall between the window and the ground. <span class="cmt_word">And on the horses.</span> As her body struck the projections, a bloody shower spurted from it, which fell in part upon the horses that drew Jehu's chariot. <span class="cmt_word">And he trode her underfoot.</span> Like Tullia (Liv, 1:48), Jehu had his chariot driven over the prostrate corpse, so that the hoofs of his horses, and perhaps his own person, were sprinkled with the royal blood. Compare the passage of Livy, "Amens, agi-tantibus furiis, Tullia per patris corpus carpentum egisse fertur, partemque sanguinis ac caedis paternae cruento vehiculo, contaminata ipsa respersaque, tutisse ad penates suos virique sui."
