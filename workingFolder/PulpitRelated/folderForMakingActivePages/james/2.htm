Bishop Lightfoot has pointed out ('Galatians,' p. 108) that, in the Old Testament, the expression is a neutral one, not necessarily involving any idea of partiality, and more often used in a good than in a bad sense. "When it becomes an independent Greek phrase, however, the bad sense attaches to <span class="accented">it</span>, owing to the secondary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as a mask,' so that  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> signifies 'to regard the external circumstances of a man' - his rank, wealth, etc. - as opposed to his real intrinsic character. Thus in the New Testament it has always a bad sense." It is exactly this <span class="accented">regard to external circumstances</span> against which St. James is warning his readers; and the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ had himself been known, when on earth, as no respecter of persons (<a href="../../par/luke/20-21.htm">Luke 20:21</a>), would give point to his warning. The plural (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is perhaps used to include the different kinds of manifestations of the sin.

The man was probably bedecked with a number of rings, and had not one only. <span class="cmt_word">In goodly apparel.</span> The same phrase is rendering "gay clothing" in ver. 3.

Hence this rendering is to be preferred. So Huther, Plumptre, and Farrar, the latter of whom explains the passage as follows: "It shows <span class="accented">doubt to</span> act as though Christ had never promised his kingdom to the poor, rich in faith; and <span class="accented">wicked reasonings</span> to argue mentally that the poor <span class="accented">must</span> be less worthy of honor than the rich."

It is, however, too slight to be worth much (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1</a>).

St. James's use here is somewhat similar (see on James 1:9, etc.). "Christiani multi ex pauperibus erant: pauci ex divitibus" (Bengel). The "rich men" here alluded to are evidently such as was the Apostle Paul before his conversion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They dragged the poor Christians before the judgment-seat (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). So Saul, "haling (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) men and women, committed them to prison" (<a href="../../par/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They blasphemed the honorable Name by which Christians were called.

No difficulty need be felt about the presence of these rich men in the synagogues of the Christians (see Introduction, p. 8.). It will be noticed that St. James <span class="accented">never</span> calls them "<span class="accented">brethren."</span> Further, it must be remembered that, at this early date, the Church had not yet learnt by bitter experience the need for that secrecy with which in later days she shrouded her worship. At this time the Christian assemblies were open to any who chose to find their way in. All were welcome, as we see from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-23.htm">1 Corinthians 14:23</a>, etc., where the chance entry of "<span class="accented">men</span> unlearned or unbelieving" is contemplated as likely to happen. Hence there is no sort of difficulty in the presence of the "rich man" here, who might be eagerly welcomed, and repay his welcome by dragging them to the judgment-seat. <span class="cmt_word">Draw you before the judgment-seats.</span> The account given by Josephus of the death of St, James himself affords a good illustration of the manner in which Christians were liable to this (see Introduction, p. 6.). But the tribunals need not be confined to Jewish ones. Other instances of similar treatment, illustrating the thoughts and language of the passage before us, may be found in <a href="../../par/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>.

[The tendency of the Jews to rely on their claim as "Abraham's children" is rebuked by the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>) and by our Lord (<a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>).

With St. Paul' it is the negation of law: "Ye are not under Law, but under grace" (<a href="../../par/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>). With St. James it is the perfection of Law. But, as Bishop Lightfoot has pointed out, "<span class="accented">the</span> ideas underlying these contradictory forms of expression need not be essentially different." The mere ritual has no value for St. James. Apart from anything higher it is sternly denounced by him (<a href="../../par/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>, etc.). The gospel is in his view a <span class="accented">Law</span>, but it is no mere system of rules, "Touch not, taste not, handle not;" it is no hard bondage, for it is a law of <span class="accented">liberty</span>, which is in exact accordance with the teaching of St. Paul, that "<span class="accented">where</span> the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <span class="accented">liberty"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>). But: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The question now arises. Granting that St. James does not contradict the doctrine of St. Paul, is he not opposing Antinomian perversions of it, and writing with conscious reference to the teaching of the apostle of the Gentiles, and the misuse which some had made of it? To this question different answers have been returned. "So long as our range of view is confined to the apostolic writings, it seems scarcely possible to resist the impression that St. James is attacking the teaching, if not of St. Paul himself, at least of those who exaggerated and perverted it. But when we realize the fact that the passage in Genesis was a common thesis in the schools of the day, that the meaning of faith was variously explained by the disputants, that diverse lessons were drawn from it - then the case is altered. The Gentile apostle and the Pharisaic rabbi might both maintain the supremacy of faith as the means of salvation; but faith with St. Paul was a very different thing kern faith with Maimonides, for instance. With the one its prominent idea is a <span class="accented">spiritual life</span>, with the other an <span class="accented">orthodox creed</span>; with the one the guiding principle is the individual conscience, with the other an external rule of ordinances; with the one faith is allied to liberty, with the other to bondage. Thus it becomes a question whether St. James's protest against reliance on faith alone has any reference direct or indirect to St. Paul's language and teaching. Whether, in fact, it is not aimed against an entirely different type of religious feeling, against the Pharisaic spirit which rested satisfied with a barren orthodoxy fruitless in works of charity" (Lightfoot on 'Galatians,' p. 164; the whole essay should be carefully studied). In favor of this view of the entire independence of the two writers, to which he inclines, Bishop Lightfoot urges: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> That the object of the much-vaunted faith of those against whom St. James writes is "<span class="accented">the</span> fundamental maxim of the Law," "Thou believest that God is one" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>); not "the fundamental fact of the gospel," "Thou believest that God raised Christ from the dead" (<a href="../../par/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> That the whole tone of the Epistle recalls our Lord's denunciations of the scribes and Pharisees, and seems directed against a kindred spirit. To these we may add: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> That the teaching of St. Paul and St. James is combined by St. Clement of Rome ('Ep. ad Corinthians,' c. 12.) in a manner which is conclusive as to the fact that he was unaware of any divergence of view between them, whether real or apparent. We conclude, then, that the teaching of St. James has no direct relation to that of St. Paul, and may well have been anterior in time to his Epistles to the Romans and Galatians.

The objection in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-35.htm">1 Corinthians 15:35</a> is introduced by precisely the same words. It is somewhat difficult to see their drift here, as what follows cannot be an objection, for it is just the position which St. James himself adopts. The formula must, therefore, be taken as introducing the perfectly fair retort to which the man who gives utterance to the sentiments of ver. 16 lays himself open. <span class="cmt_word">Without thy works.</span> Instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">A</span>, B, C, Latt., Syriac, Coptic), the Received Text has the manifestly erroneous reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> (K, L), in which it is happily not followed by the A.V.

The reading, and by consequence the translation, must be considered somewhat doubtful, as scarcely any two uncials read the words in precisely the same order. The illustration is taken from the central command of the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), indicating that the case of Jews is under consideration. The following quotations from the Talmud will show the importance attached by the Jews to this command (Farrar, 'Early Days,' etc., p. 83). It is said ('Berachoth,' fol. 13, 6) that whoever in repeating it "<span class="accented">prolongs</span> the utterance of the word '<span class="accented">One</span>,' shall have his days and years prolonged to him." Again we are told that when Rabbi Akibah was martyred he died uttering this word "One;" and then came a Bath Kol, which said, "<span class="accented">Blessed</span> art thou, Rabbi Akibah, for thy soul and the word 'One' left thy body together."

But years after this we find that God "tested Abraham" (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>). To this trial St. James refers as that by which Abraham's faith was "perfected" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>), and by which the saying of earlier years found a more complete realization (cf. Ecclus. 44:20, 21, "Abraham...  kept the Law of the Most High, and was in covenant with him...  and when he was proved, he was found faithful. Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed," etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Faith without works is dead</span>.
