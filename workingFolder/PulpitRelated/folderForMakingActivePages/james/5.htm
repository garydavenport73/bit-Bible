Their costly garments, in a great store of which the wealth of an Eastern largely consists, should become moth-eaten. Their gold and silver should be rusted. Bengel notes on this passage: "Scripta haec suut paucis annis ante obsidionem Hierosolymorum;" and certainly the best commentary upon it is to be found in the terrible account given by Josephus of the sufferings and miseries which came upon the Jews during the war and siege of Jerusalem. The Jewish historian has become the unconscious witness to the fulfillment of the prophecies of our Lord and his apostle. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: only here in the New Testament; in the LXX., <a href="../../par/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is also an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament; in LXX. used also of garments in <a href="../../par/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>.

The rendering of the A.V. is quite defensible (see Winer, p. 265), but it is equally possible to take the words as the R.V. margin," for a testimony <span class="accented">unto</span> you." "The rust of them," says Alford, "is a token of what shall happen to yourselves; in the consuming of your wealth you see depicted your own."

Ye have heaped up as it were fire in the last days." This has the support of the Syriac ("Ye have gathered fire for you for the last days"), and is adopted by Drs. Westcott and Herr. The "fire" will, of course, be the fire of judgment; and the expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may easily have been suggested by <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>. The whole form of expression also reminds us of St. Paul's "treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>), to which it is exactly parallel, the "wrath in the day of wrath" there answering to the "fire in the last days" here. (The rendering of the Vulgate is evidently influenced by this parallel, as it has <span class="accented">thesaurizastis tram.</span>) For the last days; rather, <span class="accented">in the last days</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>. If the words are connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> as suggested above, there is no difficulty in them. If the punctuation of the A.V. be retained, we must suppose that the writer is speaking from the point of view of the last day of all. "When the end came it found them heaping up treasures which they could never use" (Dean Scott). But the other view, though not so generally adopted, seems fat' preferable.

But this view is dispelled when we remember how throughout this whole passage the ideas and expressions are borrowed from the Old Testament, and when we find that in <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a> (LXX.) the wicked are represented as saying, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> passage which lies at the root of the remarkable section in Wisd. 2, "Let us oppress the poor righteous man .... Let us condemn him with a shameful death." It is probable, then, that passages such as these were in St. James's mind, and suggested the words, and thus that there is no direct allusion to the Crucifixion (which, indeed, could scarcely be laid to the charge of his readers), but that the singular <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used to denote the class collectively (cf. <a href="../../par/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>).

He, like his Master, "lays down rules and maxims and principles without specifying the limitations and exceptions." The sermon on the mount, as interpreted by our Lord's own actions, is a clear witness that this formed <span class="accented">Ms</span> method of teaching. If, then, his words do not touch the case of oaths solemnly tendered to men in a court of justice (and his own acceptance of an adjuration on his trial shows that they do <span class="accented">not</span>), no more do St. James's. Both our Lord and his apostle had probably in view "only those profane adjurations with which men who have no deep-seated fear of God garnish their common talk" (see Sadler's 'Commentary on St. Matthew,' p. 66). The special oaths mentioned were those in vogue among the Jews, and just the very ones which our Lord himself had specified (comp. Lightfoot's 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 2. p. 127, edit. Gandell). On the need of such teaching as this, see Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 190: "This people are fearfully profane. Everybody curses and swears when in a passion. No people that I have ever known can compare with these Orientals for profaneness in the use of the names and attributes of God. The evil habit seems inveterate and universal. When Peter, therefore, 'began to curse and to swear' on that dismal night of temptation, we are not to suppose that it was something foreign to his former habits. He merely relapsed, under high excitement, into what, as a sailor and a fisherman, he had been accustomed to all his life. The people now use the very same sort of oaths that are mentioned and condemned by our Lord. They swear by the head, by their life, by heaven, by the temple, or what is in its place, the church. The forms of cursing and swearing, however, are almost infinite, and fall on the pained ear all day long." So, too, Aben Ezra speaks of the practice of swearing as almost universal in his day, so that he says, "men swear daily countless times, and then swear that they have not sworn!" With regard to the translation of the verse, two renderings are possible: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of the A.V. and of the R.V. (text), "Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of the R.V. margin, "Let yours be the yea, yea, and the nay, nay;" viz. those enjoined by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>), "Let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." On behalf of this latter rendering, may be pleaded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the clearness of the reference to our Lord's teaching; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the fact that this is the interpretation given to the clause in the two leading versions of antiquity, the Syriac and the Vulgate, both of which have exactly the same words here and in St. Matthew.

If the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, be admitted, they must be taken as referring to the Lord Jesus (contrast ver. 10, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). So also in ver. 15 the Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) who shall raise him up is clearly the Lord Jesus. Had God the Father been alluded to we should probably have had the anarthrous <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> after the manner of the LXX. (see note on James 4:10). Unction is mentioned in connection with the sick also in <a href="../../par/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>. The apostles "anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them;" and compare the parable of the good Samaritan (<a href="../../par/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>), "<span class="accented">pouring</span> in wine and oil." "<span class="accented">Josephus</span> mentions that among the remedies employed in the case of Herod, he was put into a sort of oil bath.... The medicinal use of oil is also mentioned in the Mishna, which thus exhibits the Jewish practice of that day" ('Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. it. p. 595; see Mishna, 'Shabbath,' 13:4; and compare Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. it. p. 415). According to Tertullian, "<span class="accented">the</span> Christian Proculus, surnamed Torpacion, the steward of Euhodus," cured with oil Severus, the father of Antonino (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Caracalla), who "<span class="accented">in</span> gratitude kept him in his palace till the day of his death." Tertullian, 'Ad Scapulam,' c. 4. (see Oehler's notes on the passage). But in the case before us if, as in these other instances, the oil was used as an actual remedy, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> why was it to be administered by the elders? and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> why is the healing immediately afterwards attributed to "the prayer of faith"? These questions would seem to suggest that oil was enjoined by St. James rather as an outward symbol than as an actual remedy. A further question remains to which a few lines must be devoted. Is the apostle prescribing a rite for all times? On the one hand, we are told that the use of oil was connected with the miraculous powers of healing, and therefore ceased "when those powers ceased" (cf. Bishop Browne on the Articles, p. 589). On the other hand, the passage is appealed to as warranting the Roman Catholic sacrament of extreme unction. With regard to the practice of the early Church, there is a constant stream of testimony to the use of oil <span class="accented">for purposes of healing</span>; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the case in Tertullian already quoted, and many others in the fourth and fifth centuries (see 'Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' pp. 1455, 2004, 2053). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as originally practiced it was administered by laymen and even by women. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> After the <span class="accented">blessing</span> of the oil was restricted to bishops it was still regarded as immaterial by whom the unction was performed. So Psalm-Innocent, 'Ep. ad Decent.,' &sect; 8, "Being made by the bishop, it is lawful not for priests only, but for all Christians, to use it in anointing in their own need or in that of their friends." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Not till the middle of the ninth century do we meet with any express injunction to the priest to perform the unction himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "The restraint of the unction to the priest had momentous consequences. The original intention of it in relation to healing of the body was practically forgotten, and the rite came to be regarded as part of a Christian's immediate preparation for death. Hence in the twelfth century it acquired the name of 'the last unction,' <span class="accented">unctio extrema</span> (Peter Lombard, ' Sent.,' 4:23), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Catechism of Trent asserts ('De Extr. Unct.,' 3), the last of those which a man received from the Church. In the thirteenth it was placed by the schoolmen among the seven rites to which they limited the application of the term sacrament" ('Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' p. 2004). In the sixteenth century it was definitely laid down at the Council of Trent, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is a sacrament instituted by our Lord; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that by it grace is conferred, sin remitted, and the sick comforted, "sometimes also" the recovery of health is obtained; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it should be given to those in danger of death, but if they recover they may receive it again (Session 14. c. 9.). Further, the Catechism of the Council condemns as a grievous error the practice of waiting to anoint the sick "until all hope of recovery being now lost, life begins to ebb, and the sick person to sink into lifeless insensibility." In spite of this, however, the common practice in the Roman Catholic Church at the present day appears to be to administer the rite only to persons <span class="accented">in extremis.</span> Turning now to the Eastern Church, we notice that a rite of unction has been continued there up till the present time. The service, which is a somewhat lengthy one, may be seen in Daniel's 'Codex Liturgicus,' bk. 4. c.v.; and cf. Neale's 'Holy Eastern Church,' Introd., vol. it. p. 1035, where it is noted that it differs from the Western use in three points: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the oil is not previously consecrated by the bishop, but at the time by seven priests; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the unction is not conferred only <span class="accented">in extremis</span>, but in slighter illness, and if possible in the church; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is not usually considered valid unless at least three priests are present to officiate. It has been thought well to give this slight historical sketch, as affording the best answer to the claims of Romanists by showing how they have gradually departed from the primitive custom and changed the character of the rite. But the sketch will also have shown that it is scarcely accurate to imply that unction ceased when the miraculous powers ceased. At the Reformation, when the English Church wisely rejected the mediaeval service for extreme unction, she yet retained in the first English Prayer-book a simple form of unction, to be used "if the sick person desire it," consisting of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> anointing, "upon the forehead or breast only," with the sign of the cross; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> prayer for the inward anointing of the soul with the Holy Ghost, and for restoration of bodily health and strength. Thus the service was entirely primitive in character, and it is hard to see what valid objection could be raised to it. It was, however, omitted from the second English Prayer-book of 1552, and has never been restored. The justification, I suppose, of this disuse of unction must be sought in the entire absence of evidence that the primitive Church understood the passage before us as instituting a religious rite to be permanently continued. All the earliest notices of unction refer simply to its use for healing purposes.

It is difficult to know exactly what to make of this injunction to confess "one to another," which is stated in the form of an inference from the preceding. The form of the expression, "one to another," and the perfectly general term, "a righteous man," forbid us to see in it a direct injunction to confess to the clergy, and to the clergy only. But on the other hand, it is unfair to lose sight of the fact that it is directly connected with the charge to send for the elders of the Church. Marshall, in his' Penitential Discipline,' is perfectly justified in saying that St. James "hath plainly supposed the presence of the elders of the Church, and their intercession to God for the sick penitent, and then recommended the confession of his faults in that presence, where two or three assembled together in the Name of Christ might constitute a Church for that purpose" ('Penit. Discipline,' p. 80). We may, perhaps, be content with saying, with Bishop Jeremy Taylor, "When St. James exhorts all Christians to confess their sins one to another, certainly it is more agreeable to all spiritual ends that this be done rather to the curate of souls than to the ordinary brethren" ('Dissuasive from Popery,' II. 1:11; cf. Hooker, 'Eccl.

The striking position which the words occupy <span class="accented">here</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> those with which the Epistle closes, would make them linger in the memory; and there is nothing to militate against the conclusion, which appeared probable on the occasion of previous coincidences between the two writers, that St. James is the earlier of the two (comp. on James 4:6). The expression used by the apostle leaves it undetermined <span class="accented">whose</span> sins are thus "covered," whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> those of the man who is "<span class="accented">converted</span> from the error of his way," or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those of the man who wins him back, and through this good action obtains, by the grace of God, pardon for his own "multitude of sins." It has been well noticed that "<span class="accented">there</span> is a studied generality in the form of the teaching which seems to emphasize the wide blessedness of love. In the very act of seeking to convert one for whom we care we must turn to God ourselves, and in covering the past sins of another our own also are covered. In such an act love reaches its highest point, and that love includes the faith in God which is the condition of forgiveness" (Plumptre). The Epistle ends abruptly, with no salutation and no doxology. In this it stands almost by itself in the New Testament; the First Epistle of St. John alone approaching it in the abruptness of its conclusion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../james/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="James 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="James 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_peter/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Peter 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Peter 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
