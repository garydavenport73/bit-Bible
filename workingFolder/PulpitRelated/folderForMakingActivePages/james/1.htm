It is noteworthy that he keeps entirely out of sight his natural relationship to our Lord, and styles himself simply "a bond-servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ." That, and that alone, gave him a right to speak and a claim to be heard. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is similarly used by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a> by St. Peter in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; and by St. Jude ver. 1. It is clearly an <span class="accented">official</span> designation, implying that his office is one "in which, not his own will, not the will of other men, but only of God and of Christ, is to be performed" (Huther). <span class="cmt_word">To the twelve tribes</span>, etc. Compare the salutation in <a href="../../par/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>, which was also probably written by St. James: "The apostles and the elder brethren unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is common to both, and not found elsewhere in apostolic greet-tugs. (It is used by Ignatius in the opening of all his epistles except that to the Philadelphians.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The letter in the Acts is addressed to <span class="accented">Gentile</span> communities in <span class="accented">definite</span> regions; St. James's Epistle, to <span class="accented">Jews of the dispersion.</span> So also his contemporary Gamaliel wrote "to the sons of the dispersion in Babylonia, and to our brethren in Media, and to all the dispersion of Israel" (Frankel, 'Monatsschrift,' 1853, p. 413). <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>; Clem., 'Rom,' l, &sect; 55; 'Prefer. Jacob.,' c.i.). Such expressions are important as tending to show that the Jews were regarded as representing, not simply the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, but the whole nation, including those so often spoken of as "the lost tribes" (cf. 1 Esdr. 7:8). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span>. The abstract put for the concrete. It is the word used by the LXX. for the "dispersion" (2 Macc. 1:27; Jud. 5:19; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, etc.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jews "so scattered among the nations as to become the seed of a future harvest" (Westcott on St. <a href="../../par/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a>). (On the importance of the dispersion as preparing the way for Christianity, see the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 44:1.) It was divided into three great sections: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">Babylonian</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the original dispersion; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Syrian</span>, dating from the Greek conquests in Asia, Seleucus Nicator having transplanted largo bodies of Jews from Babylonia to the capitals of his Western provinces; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="accented">Egyptian</span>, the Jewish settlements in Alexandria, established by Alexander and Ptolemy I., and thence spreading along the north coast of Africa. To these we should, perhaps, add a fourth - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="accented">Roman</span>, consequent upon the occupation of Jerusalem by Pompey,  <span class="date">B.C. 63</span>. All these four divisions were represented in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-8.htm">Acts 2:8-11</a>) - a fact which will help to account for St. James's letter. The whole expression, "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad," makes it perfectly clear that St. James is writing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Jews, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to those beyond the borders of Palestine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-18.</span> - THE SUBJECT OF TEMPTATION.

A favorite expression with St. James, occurring no less than fifteen times in the compass of this short Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Count it all joy</span>, etc.; cf. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a>, "Wherein ye greatly <span class="accented">rejoice</span>, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief <span class="accented">in manifold temptations</span>, that the <span class="accented">proof of your faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)...  might be found unto praise," etc. The coincidence is too close to be accidental, although the shade of meaning given to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is slightly different, if indeed it has any right in the text in St. Peter (see Herr, vol. it. p. 102). Here it has its proper force, and signifies <span class="accented">that by which the faith is tried</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the instrument of trial rather than the process of trial. Thus the passage in ver. 3 becomes parallel to <a href="../../par/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>, "tribulation worketh patience." With regard to the sentiments of ver. 2, "Count it all joy," etc., contrast <a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>. Experience, however, shows that the two are compatible. It is quite possible to shrink beforehand from temptation, and pray with intense earnestness, "Lead us not into temptation," and yet, when the temptation comes, to meet it joyfully, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The use of this word implies that the temptations of which St. James is thinking are <span class="accented">external</span> (see <a href="../../par/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30</a>, where the same word is used of the man <span class="accented">who fell among</span> thieves). <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32, 33</a> will show the trials to which believing Jews were subject. But the epithet "manifold" would indicate that we should not confine the word here to trials such as those.

The whole passage before us (vers. 2-6) affords a most remarkable instance of the figure called by grammarians anadiplosis, the repetition of a marked word at the close of one clause and beginning of another. "The trial of your faith worketh <span class="accented">patience</span>; but let <span class="accented">patience</span> have her <span class="accented">perfect</span> work, that ye may be <span class="accented">perfect</span> and entire, <span class="accented">lacking</span> in nothing.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all <i>men</i> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> <span class="accented">- Digression suggested by the thought of perfection.</span> There can be no true perfection without wisdom, which is the gift of God, and must be sought from him. It is possible that the thought and connection of the passage is due to a reminiscence of Wisd. 9:6, "For though a man be never so perfect (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded." But whether this be so or not, the teaching is manifestly founded on our Lord's words with regard to prayer, <a href="../../par/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, "Ask, and it shall be given you;" and <a href="../../par/mark/11-23.htm">Mark 11:23</a>, "Have faith in God.

The image is taken from the wave sheaf, the firstfruits of the harvest, the earnest of the crop to follow. St. Paul (according to a very possible reading) has the same figure in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, "God chose you as firstfruits (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>);" see R.V. margin. Elsewhere he applies it to Christ, "the Firstfruits of them that are asleep" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). "His creatures (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." It does not appear to be absolutely necessary to extend the use of this word so as to include the irrational creation as well as mankind. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> is frequently used in rabbinical writings for <span class="accented">the Gentile world</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> may be given the same meaning here, and perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>.

Similar maxims were not infrequent among the Jews.

In the rabbinical work, 'Pirqe Aboth,' 1. 12, we have the following saying of Rabbi Simeon, the son of Gamaliel (who must, therefore, have been a contemporary of St. James): "All my days I have grown up amongst the wise, and have not found ought good for a man but silence; not learning but doing is the groundwork; and whoso multiplies words occasions sin."

The figurative meaning occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>. Properly it signifies to "peep into." See its use in the LXX., <a href="../../par/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6</a>; Ecclus. 21:23.

Its use in St. Peter, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, is easy enough to explain. Angels desire even a glimpse of the mysteries. But what are we to say of its use hero?

The substantive is anarthrous, yet the attributive has the article. This construction serves to give greater prominence to the attributive, and requires the rendering given above (see Winer, &sect; 20:4).
