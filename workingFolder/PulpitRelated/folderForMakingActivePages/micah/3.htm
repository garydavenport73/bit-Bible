Micah addresses the heads of families and the officials to whom the administration of justice appertained. These magistrates and judges seem to have been chiefly members of the royal family, at any rate in Judah; see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-11.htm">Jeremiah 21:11, 12</a> (Cheyne).

We have the same figurative expression for merciless extortion and pillage. Ezekiel makes a similar complaint (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>). Cheyne sees in this and the following verse a possible allusion to cannibalism as at least known to the Israelites by hearsay or tradition. There is a passage in Wisdom (12:5) which somewhat countenances the idea that the Canaanites were guilty of this enormity, but it is probably only a rhetorical exaggeration of the writer. In the present passage the terms seem to be simply metaphors taken from the preparation of meat for human food. Such an allusion is natural in the mouth of one who had just been speaking of Israel as a flock (<a href="../../par/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>).

The people are treated by their rulers as cattle made to be eaten, flayed, broken up, chopped into pieces, boiled in the pot (comp <a href="../../par/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>). (For an analogous figure, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3-5</a>.)

These are the lying prophets of whom Jeremiah complains (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace.</span> Very many commentators take the phrase, "bite with the teeth," to mean "eat," so that the clause signifies that the prophets when bribed with food predict peace and happiness to people. The antithesis of the following clause seems to require this explanation, which is further supported by the Chaldee. But it is quite unprecedented to find the word translated "bite" (<span class="accented">nashakh</span>) in the sense of "eat," or as it is taken here, "to have something to eat;" wherever it occurs it means "to bite like a serpent," to wound (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>). The parallelism of the succeeding member does not compel us to put a forced interpretation upon the word. These venal seers do vital harm, inflict gravest injury, when they proclaim peace where there is no peace; by such false comfort they are really infusing poison and death. <span class="cmt_word">He that putteth not into their mouths.</span> If any one does not bribe them, and so stop their evil mouths. <span class="cmt_word">They even prepare war against him.</span> The Hebrew expression is, "they consecrate" or  "sanctify war." There may be allusion to the religious rites accompanying a declaration of war (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>); but Micah seems to mean that, if the customary bribes are withheld, these prophets announce war and calamity as inevitable; they proclaim them in God's name, as speaking with his sanction and under his Inspiration (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; see note on Zephaniah 1:7).

But it is best taken as still addressed to the rulers, and Micah tells how that in the time of their distress there shall be no prophecy to direct them (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>).

Parallel and identical in meaning with the preceding clause. <span class="cmt_word">The sun shall go down over the prophets;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> over the false prophets. The sun of their prosperity shall set. Micah seems to derive his imagery from the phenomena of an eclipse (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The day.</span> The time of their punishment (<a href="../../par/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>).

The first of these is "power," - such might imparted to him that his words fall with force and proclaim their Divine origin (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).

"The general surface of Mount Zion descends steeply eastwards into the Tyropoeon and Kidron, and southwards into the Valley of Hinnom.
