At the fruit. harvest no early figs are to be found, and (in the next clause) after the vintage no more grapes; so in Israel there is none righteous left. The Septuagint gives a plainer exposition, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I became as one that gathereth straw in harvest;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Factus sum sicut qui collegit in autumno racemos vindimiae</span>, joining the two clauses together. My soul desired the first ripe fruit; better, <span class="accented">nor</span> <span class="accented">early fig which my soul desired.</span> The holiness and grace of more primitive times are wholly absent from this later period (see <a href="../../par/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, where a similar figure is used; compare also Christ's dealing with the barren fig tree, <a href="../../par/matthew/21-18.htm">Matthew 21:18</a>, etc.). The first ripe figs were proverbially sweet and good (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>; and Hosea, <span class="accented">loc cit</span>.).

Instead of this, they pursue them as the fowler traps birds, or the hunter beasts. The word rendered "net" (<span class="accented">cherem</span>) is in most versions translated "destruction." Thus, Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1fc7;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">ad mortem venatur</span>; so the Syriac and Chaldee.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <i>asketh</i> for a reward; and the great <i>man</i>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may do evil,</span> etc. rather, <span class="accented">both hands are upon</span> (equivalent to "busy with") <span class="accented">evil to do it thoroughly</span>. This clause and the rest of the verse are very obscure Cheyne supposes the text to be corrupt. Henderson renders, "For evil their hands are well prepared;" so virtually Hitzig, Pusey, and the Septuagint. Caspari agrees rather with the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Malum manuum suarum dicunt bonum</span>)," Hands are (busy) upon evil to make (it seem) good," which looks to that extremity of iniquity  when men "call evil good, and good evil" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The general meaning is that they are ready enough to do evil, and, as the next clause says, can be bribed to do anything. <span class="cmt_word">The prince asketh;</span> makes some nefarious demand of the judge, some perversion of justice at his hands, as in the case of Naboth (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The judge asketh</span> (<span class="accented">is ready</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for a reward.</span> The judge is willing to do what the prince wishes, if he is bribed for it.

The passage is altered in meaning by a different grouping of the Hebrew letters, thus: "The prince demandeth (a reward) to do good; and the judge, for the recompense of a great man, uttereth what he himself desireth. And they entangle the good more than briars, and the righteous more than a thorn hedge." The LXX. carries on the sense to the next verse, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "And I will destroy their goods as a consuming moth."

The decree (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>) is explained by Hengstenberg and many commentators, ancient and modern, to he that of the enemy by which they held Israel captive. Keil and others suppose the law to be meant which separated Israel from all other nations, the ancient ordinance which confined God's people and the blessings of the theocracy to narrow limits. This is now to be set aside (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-16</a>), when heathen nations flock to the city of God. Oaspari, Hitzig, Cheyne, and others translate, "shall the bound be afar off," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the boundaries of the land of Israel shall be widely extended (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>, which Cheyne explains, "Thine eyes shall behold a widely extended territory"). Wordsworth obtains much the same meaning by taking the verb in the sense of "promulgated," and referring the "decree," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7, 8</a>, to God's purpose of giving to Messiah the utmost parts of the earth for a possession. The building, of the walls does not indicate the narowing of the limits of the theocratic kingdom. Whether <span class="accented">chok</span> be taken to signify "decree" (<span class="accented">lex</span>, Vulgate) or "boundary," the effect of its removal afar is seen by the next verse to be the entrance of foreign nations into the kingdom of God.
