So Moses, in his song (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>), calls on heaven and earth to listen to his words (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>). These expressions are not mere rhetorical figures; they have a special application. Whatever happens to Israel has a bearing on the development of the kingdom of God; the judgments on the chosen people are not only a warning to the heathen, but bring on the great consummation. <span class="cmt_word">All that therein is;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the fulness thereof</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">plentitudo ejus</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>, "all ye that are therein" (<a href="../../par/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let the Lord God</span> (<span class="accented">the Lord Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>be witness against you</span>.

God is hidden except when he displays his power in judgment and mercy (see note on Zechariah 14:3). <span class="cmt_word">Will come down.</span> An anthropomorphic expression, as <a href="../../par/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The high places.</span> As though descending from heaven, God first came upon the tops of the mountains (see note on Amos 4:13; comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>).

The idea that underlies this description is that the inanimate creation shares in the effects of the judgment on man, and is used as an instrument in his punishment.

He names the capitals of the two kingdoms as the source and centre of the idolatry and wickedness which pervaded the whole country. Samaria was built by Omri, a king who "wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him;" and in it his son Ahab erected a temple to Baal (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32</a>), and it became the chief seat of idolatry in the land. <span class="cmt_word">What are the high places?</span> The prophet seems to say that Jerusalem is no longer the Lord's sanctuary, but a collection of unauthorized or idolatrous shrines. These were buildings or altars erected in conspicuous spots, contrary to the enactments of the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11-14</a>), and used more or less for idolatrous worship. With a strange perversity, the Jews mixed the pure service of Jehovah with the rites of heathen deities. Even the best kings of Judah were unable wholly to suppress these local sanctuaries (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>, etc.). They were found even in Jerusalem itself (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>), especially in the time of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a>). The parallelism of this clause with the preceding being thought defective ("high places" being not parallel with "apostasy"), the Septuagint reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "the sin," followed by the Syriac and the Targum. One Hebrew manuscript confirms the reading; but it is probably unauthorized, and has been ignorantly introduced The prophet defines the sins of Samaria and Jerusalem. The sin of the former is apostasy; that of the latter, unauthorized worship. Instead of "what" in both places the Hebrew gives "who," implying that there is a personal cause, the two capitals being personified. Hezekiah's partial reformation had not taken place when this was uttered.

Such shall be the utter ruin of the city, that on its site vines shall be planted. The prophet here uses a description of complete destruction which is a regular formula in Assyrian inscriptions, where we read of cities being made into "a rubbish heap and a field." The expression occurs, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in a monument of Tiglath-Pileser (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 449). <span class="cmt_word">I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley</span>. Samaria stood on a hilly platform (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), with a sheer descent on every side, and when it was overthrown its stones were hurled into the valley surrounding it, as may be seen to this day. "When we looked down," says Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 136), "at the gaunt columns rising out of the little terraced fields, and the vines clambering up the sides of the hill once covered by the palaces of proud Samaria, who could help recalling the prophecy of Micah? Not more literally have the denunciations on Tyre or on Babylon been accomplished. What though Sebaste rose, under Herod, to a pitch of greater splendour than even old Samaria, the effort was in vain, and the curse has been fully accomplished.

Idolatry is viewed as spiritual fornication, and the offerings made to the idol temples are reckoned to be harlot gifts.

The judgment on Samaria was executed by the Assyrians. Three times in his short reign of less than six years did Shalmaneser IV. invade Israel. Shortly after his accession, having reason to suspect the fidelity of Hoshea, he "came up against him" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>), and so overawed him by the exhibition of his superior power that the King of Israel submitted without a struggle, "became his servants and gave him presents," or rendered him tribute. But Hoshea's allegiance was not yet secured. Encouraged by the enterprise and success of the Ethiopian monarch So, or Shebek, who had defeated and slain the Egyptian king, and established himself firmly on the throne of Upper Egypt, Hoshea, in reliance on Egyptian aid, again threw off the yoke of Assyria, and refused the customary tribute. His punishment was speedy and sharp. Shalmaneser had no difficulty in making himself master of his person, "shut him up and bound him in prison." On a fresh act of rebellion, of what nature we are not informed, Shalmaneser made his third attack. This time he was everywhere resisted, and ended by laying siege to Samaria itself. Before this city his forces were detained for more than two years; nor was it till  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, when apparently his own reign had come to an end, that Samaria was taken, his successor Sargon claiming the conquest as appertaining to his first year (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2. ch. 9.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - 3. <span class="accented">Micah mourns because the punishment extends to Judah also.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will wail.</span> The prophet marks the destruction of Samaria with these outward signs of mourning, in order that he might affect the minds of his own countrymen, and show how he grieved over their sins which should bring like punishment. The word rendered "wail" means "to beat" the breast.

The two epithets contain one notion; the prophet assumes the character, not merely of a mourner, who put off his usual garments, but that of a captive who was stripped to the skin and carried away naked and despoiled (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Dragons</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: Hebrew, <span class="accented">tannim</span>, "jackals" (<a href="../../par/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>), whose mournful howling is well known to all travellers in the East. <span class="cmt_word">Owls</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "daughters of sirens;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">struthionum.</span> The bird is called in Hebrew bath <span class="accented">yaanah</span>, which some explain "daughter of the desert," or else refer to roots meaning either "to cry out" or "to be freed."

Gath is mentioned as the seat of the Philistines, the constant and powerful enemy  of Judah. (For its situation, see note on Amos 6:2.) The paronomasias in this passage, which seem to modern ears artificial and puerile, are paralleled in many writings both Hebrew and classic, and were natural to a people who looked for mystical meaning in words and names. Thus Gath is taken to signify "Tell town," and the clause is, "In Tell town tell it not." <span class="cmt_word">Weep ye not at all;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">lacrymis ne ploretis</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "weep in silence," or "hide your tears," that the enemy may not know your grief. As in cash of the other clauses a town is mentioned, some editors would here read, "In Acco ('Weep town') weep not!" - Acco being the later Ptolemais, the modern St. Jean d'Acre, and taken here to represent another foreign city which would rejoice at Judah's misfortunes (see, <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>). The Septuagint alone of all the versions seems to countenance this reading, by translating, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "Ye Enakim, do not rebuild," which has been resolved into <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;</span>, supposed to be an error for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;</span> The objections against this reading may be seen in Keil and Pusey. There is a play on the words in both these clauses (as in the following five verses), which is not seen in the English Version, <span class="accented">begath al taggidu</span>, and <span class="accented">bako al tibeku.</span> Knabenbauer imitates the paronomasia in Latin, "Cannis ne canite; Anconae ne angamini;" Ewald and Schegg in German, "In Molln meldet nicht; in Weinsberg. weinet nicht;" Reuss in French, "N'allez pas le dire a Dijon! N'allez pas pleurer a Ploermel!" In these puns, as we should call them, the prophet is far, indeed, from jesting. "He sees," says Dr. Cheyne, "like Isaiah, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>, a preordained correspondence between names and fortunes;" and he wishes to impress this on his countrymen, that the judgment may not come upon them unwarned. <span class="cmt_word">In the house of Aphrah</span>; better, at <span class="accented">Beth-le-Aphrah, i.e.</span> "House of dust;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in domo pulveris.</span> The site of Aphrah is unknown. Some identify it with Ophrah in Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>), four miles northeast of Bethel; others, with Ophrah in Philistia (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-14.htm">1 Chronicles 4:14</a>). Host of the towns named below lie in the Shephelah. Keil notes that the word is pointed with <span class="accented">pathach</span> here for the sake of the paronomasia. <span class="cmt_word">Roll thyself in the dust;</span> <span class="accented">sprinkle dust upon thyself</span>. This was a common sign of mourning (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>). The Hebrew text (in contradistinction to the margin, Keri) gives, "I roll myself," or "I have besprinkled myself," the prophet identifying himself with the people. But as in all the subsequent passages, not what the prophet does, but what the inhabitants do, is the point impressed, the reading of the Keri is hem to be preferred. Vulgate, <span class="accented">pulvere vos conspergite.</span> The Septuagint has an inexplicable rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "against laughter sprinkle earth," which Brenton translates, "sprinkle dust in the place of your laughter." With this section (vers. 10-15) should be compared <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>, which describes the alarm occasioned by Sennacherib's invasion of Judah from the northeast, as Micah represents his progress to the southwest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pass ye away.</span> Leave your house. <span class="cmt_word">Thou inhabitant of Saphir.</span> The Hebrew is "inhabitress," the population being personified as a virgin (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-21.htm">2 Kings 19:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). "Saphir" means "Fair city."

St. Jerome, in despair of explaining these Greek renderings, says here, "Multum Hebraicum a LXX. interpretatione discordat, et tantis tam mea quam illorum translatio difficultatibus involuta est, ut si quando indiguimus Spiritus Dei (semper autem in exponendis Scripturis sanctis illius indigemus adventu), nunc vel maxime eum adesse cupiamus." <span class="cmt_word">Zaanan</span> is supposed to be the same as Zenan, mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-37.htm">Joshua 15:37</a>. The meaning of the name is doubtful. It is taken to signify "abounding in flocks" or "going out." <span class="cmt_word">Came not forth;</span> or, <span class="accented">is not come forth.</span> The paronomasia seems to lie rather in sound than sense, and is variously explained, "The inhabitants of Flock town went not forth with their flocks." "The dwellers of Forthcoming came not forth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to flee, or to fight, or to aid their brethren; or did not escape destruction. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Non est egressa quae habitat in exitu</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>, "She who dwelt at Sennaar came not forth." <span class="cmt_word">In the mourning,</span> etc. These words are best joined with the following clause, thus: <span class="accented">The mourning of Beth-ezel taketh from you its standing</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refuge or shelter. Beth-ezel is explained, "House at one's side." "Neighbour town;" so the prophet would say, "Neighbour town is no neighbour to you," affords you no help. But various other explanations are given. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Lamentation makes its sure abode at Beth-ezel from your calamity." This may, perhaps, be supported by the rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "She shall receive of you the stroke of anguish." Dr. Cheyne connects the whole  verse with one idea, "Zaanan would willingly take to flight, but the sound of the mourning at Beth-ezel (which might mean, "the house, or place, at one's side') fills them with despair." Taking Beth-ezel to mean "House of root," others would interpret, on account of the public sorrow, "The 'house of root' affords no firm home for you." Others, again," The lamentation of 'The near House' will not stop near it, but pass on to other places." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-ezel</span> is probably the <span class="accented">Azal</span> of <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>, the <span class="accented">beth</span> being dropped, as is often the case.

She was the beginning, etc. How Lachish came to adopt the idolatry of Israel, and how she infected Judah, we know not. A connection between Jerusalem and Lachish is found in the case of Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>), but nothing bearing on religion is mentioned. The whole clause is translated by Calmer, Keil, etc., thus: "It was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion that the iniquities of Israel were found in thee" (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). The particular transgressions meant may be the idolatry of Jehoram (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-6.htm">2 Chronicles 21:6</a>) and Ahaziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3, 4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib <i>shall be</i> a lie to the kings of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>.

The prophet here addresses Judah, and continues to do so to the end of the chapter. <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou give presents to Moreshsth-Gath.</span> The "presents" intended are parting gifts, farewell presents. The word is used (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>) for the dowry given to a daughter when she is married. The meaning, therefore, is that Judah must relinquish all claim to Moresheth. The paronomasia is explained in two ways. As <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> may mean "possession," the prophet may be understood to say, "Thou shalt give up possession of Gath's possession." Or the play of words may depend upon the similarity of sound between <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> and <span class="accented">Meorasah</span>, "Betrothed" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), "Thou shalt give dismissal (bill of divorcement) to the city once betrothed to thee." Moresheth-Gath, Micah's birthplace, is placed just south of Beit Jibrin, or Eleutheropolis, about twenty-five miles from Gaza (see Introduction, &sect; II.). The addition of Gath to the name of the town is meant to mark its situation in the immediate neighbourhood of that well known city. So we have Bethlehem-Judah (<a href="../../par/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>), Abel-Maim or Maachah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>).

Ain Kezbeh</span>, eight miles north of Adullam, is probably the same as Chezib (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>), where Shelah, Judah's son by Tamar, was born. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Israel.</span> "Israel" is here equivalent to Judah, having, according to the prediction of vers. 6, 7, lost its political existence (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19</a>, where Ahaz is called King of Israel).

The "heir" is the Assyrian king, Sargon, into whose possession the city shall pass. Mareshah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>) was near Achzib, one mile southcast of Beit Jibrin, and is now  called <span class="accented">Mer'ash</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall come,</span> etc.; better, <span class="accented">the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nobility (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>) of Israel shall fly for refuge to such places as the cave of Adullam, David's asylum (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>).

But Rosenmuller, Henderson, Pusey, and others take the sentence as in the Authorized Version, making "the glory of Israel" in apposition with "Adullam," and understanding by "he" the heir or enemy. One knows no reason why Aduliam should be honoured with the above-named title; so the rendering given above is preferable. There is probably a paronomasia intended, "The glory of the Lord shall set (<span class="accented">ad olam</span>) forever." The city of Adullam, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Aid-el-Mah</span>, lay in the valley of Elah, ten miles northwest of Hebron, halfway between Sochoh and Keilah. It was of great antiquity, being mentioned as the birthplace of Hirah, the friend of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12</a>), and one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). In its neighbourhood is the celebrated cave, Mugha et Khureitun, which is pointed out as the traditional hold of David, and which has been carefully explored by Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake, of the Palestine Exploration Fund (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 332, etc.).
