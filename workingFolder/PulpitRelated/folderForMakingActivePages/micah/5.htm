Jerusalem is addressed, as in <a href="../../par/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9, 11</a>, not the invading army. The prophet returns to the view of the misery and humiliation expressed in that passage. <span class="cmt_word">Gather thyself in troops;</span> or, <span class="accented">thou shalt gather thyself, etc.</span> Jerusalem must collect its armies to defend itself from the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">O daughter of troops.</span> Jerusalem is thus named from the number of soldiers collected within her walls, from whence marauding expeditions were wont to set forth. Pusey considers that she is so called from the acts of violence, robbery, and bloodshed which are done within her (<a href="../../par/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>). Keil thinks the prophet represents the people crowding together in fear. It is more natural to refer the expression to the abnormal assemblage of soldiers and fugitives within the walls of a besieged city. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1fb7;</span>, "The daughter shall be wholly hemmed in;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vastaberis, filia latronis. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He hath laid siege.</span> The enemy is spoken of by an abrupt change of person (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Against us.</span> The prophet identifies himself with the besieged people. <span class="cmt_word">They shall smite the judge of Israel,</span> etc. "The judge" represents the supreme authority, whether king or other governor (<a href="../../par/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>); but he is called here "judge," that the sacred name of king may not be spoken of as dishonoured. To smite upon the cheek is the grossest insult (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>) When Zion is thus besieged, and its rulers suffer the utmost contumely, its condition must look hopeless, Such a state of things was realized in the treatment of Zedekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.), and in many subsequent sieges of Jerusalem. But the underlying idea is that Israel shall suffer dire distress at the hands of her enemies until Messiah comes, and she herself turns to the Lord. The LXX. translates <span class="accented">shophet</span>, "judge," by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, "tribes," but the other Greek translators give <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>.

This passage was quoted by the Sanhedrin to answer Herod's question where the Christ was to be born (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5, 6</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah.</span> Ephratah (Ephrathah, or Ephrath), "fruitfulness," is another name for Bethlehem, "House of bread" (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a>); from its position it is also called Bethlehem Judah (<a href="../../par/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>), being situated in the tribal lot of Judah, about five miles south of Jerusalem, and thus distinguished from a town of the same name in Zebulun(<a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;</span> Alex.]. "And thou, Bethlehem, house of Ephrathah." The rest of the clause is best translated, <span class="accented">too little to be among the thousands of Judah</span>. Each tribe was divided into "thousands," which would be equivalent to clans, with its own head. Probably the reckoning was made of fighting men (see note on Zechariah 9:7; and comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-21.htm">Joshua 22:21, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>). Bethlehem, called in the text Bethlehem Ephratah for solemnity's sake, was a small place (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>), of such slight importance as not to be named among the possessions of Judah in <a href="../../par/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15</a>, or in the catalogue of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Yet out of thee shall he</span> (<span class="accented">one</span>) <span class="cmt_word">come forth unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel.</span> In spite of its insignificance, this birthplace of David shall be the birthplace of Messiah. "Shall some forth" is spoken sometimes of birth and descent, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> and Genesis 35:11; at other times it contains merely the notion of proceeding from, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>. In the present ease both ideas are suitable. <span class="accented">Unto me</span> (Jehovah is speaking). To my praise and glory, to do my will. Micah by these words would recall the announcement concerning David made to Samuel, "I have provided me a king" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>), and thus show the typical relation of David to the Messiah (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting</span>. The meaning of the word rendered "goings forth" (<span class="accented">motsaoth</span>) is somewhat doubtful. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">egressus</span>. The Fathers see in it a declaration of the eternal generation of the Son: he who was born in time at Bethlehem hath an eternal existence. In this case the plural form of the word is a plural of majesty, or an abstract expression (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/114-2.htm">Psalm 114:2</a>, "dominions;" <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>. "habitations"). To Christians, who believe in the mystery of the Holy Trinity, the plural would express the continual generation or the Son from the Father from everlasting and to everlasting, never beginning and never ending; as the Council of Lateran says, "Without beginning ever and  without end, the Father begetting, the Sen being born (<span class="accented">nascens</span>), and the Holy Ghost proceeding." Many commentators take the "goings forth" to be the ancient promises, the revelations of the Angel of the covenant to the patriarchs, the various preparations made in type and history for the appearance of the great Son of David in due time; but this is a forced interpretation of the word. Granted that Micah's contemporaries understood the prophecy to state merely that a Saviour should arise from the lineage of David who traced his descent from hoar antiquity, and might be said to have lived in the days of old, this fact (if it be a fact) does not preclude us, with our more perfect knowledge, from seeing a deeper meaning in the inspired utterance, an adumbration of the nature of that Prince whom Isaiah calls "Everlasting" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), the Word who "was in the beginning with God" (<a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 2</a>). We may note certain contrasts in these two first verses. Zion, "the daughter of troops," is contrasted with the mean and insignificant Bethlehem; yet the former shall be shamefully handled, the latter highly honoured; that one's king shall be dethroned and disgraced, this one's Ruler is from everlasting and to everlasting.

This presupposes that the house of David will have lost the throne and have been reduced to a low condition. <span class="cmt_word">Will he give them up.</span> Jehovah will give up the people to its enemies; this is the way in which the house of David shall come to low estate. <span class="cmt_word">She which travaileth hath brought forth.</span> Many commentators have taken the travailing woman to be the afflicted community of Israel, or Zion; but we may not altogether reject the old interpretation which regards this as a prophecy of the birth of Christ from the Virgin, in accordance with the received Messianic exposition of Isaiah's great prediction, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Such an announcement comes in naturally after the announcement of the Ruler coming forth from Bethlehem.

Peace personified (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>). It is best to put a full stop here, and remove the colon at "land" in the next clause.
