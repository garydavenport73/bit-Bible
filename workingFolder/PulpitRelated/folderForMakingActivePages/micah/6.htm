<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, <i>and</i> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The people, awakened to its ingratitude and need of atonement, asks how to please God, and is referred for answer to the moral requirements of the Law.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It is greatly doubted who is the speaker here. Bishop Butler, in his sermon "Upon the Character of Balaam," adopts the view that Balak is the speaker of vers. 6 and 7, and Balaam answers in ver. 8. Knabenbauer considers Micah himself as the interlocutor, speaking in the character of the people; which makes the apparent change of persons in ver. 8 very awkward. Most commentators, ancient and modern, take the questions in vers. 6 and 7 to be asked by the people personified, though they are not agreed as to the spirit from which they proceed, some thinking that they are uttered in self-righteousness, as if the speakers had done all that and more than could be required of them; others regarding the inquiries as representing a certain acknowledgment of sin and a desire for means of propitiation, though there is exhibited a want of appreciation of the nature of God and of the service which alone is acceptable to him. The latter view is most reasonable, and in accordance with Micah's manner. <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with what offering?

The Vulgate has a different reading, <span class="accented">In multis millibus hircorum pinguium</span>; so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "with ten thousands of fat goats," so also the Syriac. The alteration has been introduced probably with some idea of making the parallelism more exact. <span class="cmt_word">Shall I give my firstborn?</span> Micah exactly represents the people's feeling; they would do anything but what God required; they would make the costliest sacrifice, even, m their exaggerated devotion, holding themselves ready to make a forbidden offering; but they would not attend to the moral requirements of the Law. It is probably by a mere hyperbole that the question in the text is asked. The practice of human sacrifice was founded on the notion that man ought to offer to God his dearest and costliest, and that the acceptability of an offering was proportioned to its preciousness. The Hebrews had learned the custom from their neighbours, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Phoenicians and Moabites (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>), and had for centuries offered their children to Moloch, in defiance of the stern prohibitions of Moses and their prophets (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). They might have learned, from many facts and inferences, that man's self-surrender was not to be realized by this ritual; the sanctity of human life (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), the substitution of the ram for Isaac (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>), the redemption of the firstborn (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>), all made for this truth. But the heathen idea retained its hold among them, so that the inquiry above is in strict keeping with the circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">The fruit of my body;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rest of my children (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>).

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>,"Hath it not been told thee?" <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>What doth the Lord require of thee?</span> The prophets often enforce the truth that the principles of righteous conduct are required from men, and not mere formal worship. This might well be a comfort to the Israelites when they heard that they were doomed to be cast out of their country, and that the temple was to be destroyed, and that the ritual on which they laid such stress would for a time become impracticable. So the inculcation of moral virtues is often connected with the prediction of woe or captivity. (For the prophetic view of the paramount importance of righteousness, see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.: 1. 8, etc.; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, etc.; see on Zechariah 7:7.) <span class="cmt_word">To do justly.</span> To act equitably, to hurt nobody by word or deed, which was the exact contrary of the conduct previously mentioned (<a href="../../par/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1, 2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To love mercy.</span> To be guided in conduct to others by loving kindness. These two rules contain the whole duty to the neighbour. Compare Christ's description of genuine religion (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To walk humbly with thy God.</span> This precept comprises man's duty to God, humility and obedience. "To walk" is an expression implying "to live and act" as the patriarchs are said to have "walked with God," denoting that they lived as consciously under his eye and referred all their actions to him. Humility is greatly enforced in the Scriptures (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, etc.). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "to be ready to walk with the Lord;" Vulgate, S<span class="accented">olicitum ambulare</span> <span class="accented">cum Deo</span>; Syriac, "Be prepared to follow thy God." But our version is doubtless correct. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and <i>the man of</i> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - &sect; 3. <span class="accented">Because Israel was very far from acting in this spirit, God sternly rebukes her for prevailing sins</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord's voice</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>). These are no longer the words of the prophet, but those of God himself, and not spoken in secret, but unto the city, that all may hear the sentence who dwell in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The man of wisdom shall see thy Name</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he who is wise regards thy Name and obeys time, does not simply hear, but profits by what he hears. The reading is uncertain. Others render, "Blessed is he who sees thy Name;" but the construction is against this. Others, "Thy Name looketh to wisdom" (or prosperity), has the true wisdom of life in sight. The versions read "fear" for "see." Thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39f;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "Shall save those that fear his Name;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Salus erit timentibus Nomen tuum</span>; Syriac, "He imparts instruction to those that fear his Name;" Chaldee, "The teachers fear his Name." This reading depends upon a change of vowel pointing. Orelli renders, "Happy is he who fears thy Name." The Authorized translation, which seems on the whole to be well established, takes the abstract noun "wisdom" as equivalent to "the wise," or "the man of wisdom." For similar expressions, Henderson refers to <a href="../../par/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>-4; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-6.htm">Proverbs 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>.

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; "Is there fire and the house of the wicked treasuring up wicked treasures?" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Adhuc ignis in domo impii thesauri iniquitatis?</span> So the Syriac; the Chaldee keeps to the Masoretic reading. <span class="cmt_word">The scant measure;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the ephah of leanness.</span> The ephah was about three pecks. According to Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:09. 2), it contained one Attic medimnus, which would be nearly a bushel and a half. Fraudulent weights and measures are often denounced (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-14.htm">Deuteronomy 25:14</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-10.htm">Proverbs 20:10, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Mensura minor irae plena</span>, where the Hebrew has, that is abominable. Such frauds are hateful to God, and are marked with his wrath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">Shall I count <i>them</i> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I count them pure?</span> literally, <span class="accented">Shall I be pure?</span> The clause is obscure. The Authorized Version regards the speaker as the same as in ver. 10, and translates with some violence to the text. It may be that the prophet speaks as the representative of the awakened transgressor, "Can I be guiltless with such deceit about me?" But the sudden change of personification and of state of feeling is very harsh. Hence some follow Jerome in regarding God as the speaker, and rendering, "Shall I justify the wicked balance?" others, the Septuagint, Syriac, and Chaldee, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; "Shall the wicked be justified by the balance?" Cheyne is inclined to read the verb in the second person, "Canst thou (O Jerusalem) be pure?" since in the next verse the prophet proceeds, "the rich men thereof" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Jerusalem). If we retain the present reading, "Can I be innocent?" we must consider the question as put, for effect's sake, in the mouth of one of the rich oppressors. Jerome's translation is contrary to the use of the verb, which is always intransitive in kal.

They have just been charged with injustice and fraud, now they are denounced for practising every kind of violence. And not only the rich, but all the inhabitants fall under censure for lying and deceit. <span class="cmt_word">Their tongue is deceitful;</span> literally, <span class="accented">deceit</span>; they cannot open their mouth without speaking dangerous and destructive lies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/6-13.htm">Micah 6:13</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore also will I make <i>thee</i> sick in smiting thee, in making <i>thee</i> desolate because of thy sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-16.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">For all this God threatens punishment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will I make thee sick in smiting thee;</span> literally, <span class="accented">have made the smiting thee sick</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> incurable, as <a href="../../par/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>, or, "have made the blows mortal that are given thee." The perfect is used to express the certainty of the future. The Septuagint and Vulgate read, "I have begun [or, will begin] to smite thee." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/6-14.htm">Micah 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <i>shall be</i> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <i>that</i> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt eat,</span> etc. The punishment answers to the sin (which proves that it comes from God), and recalls the threats of the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy humiliation, thy decay and downfall, shall occur in the very centre of thy wealth and strength, where thou hast laid up thy treasure and practised thy wickedness. But the meaning of the Hebrew is very uncertain, and the text may be corrupt. The LXX. had a different reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "darkness shall be in thee." The Syriac and Chaldee interpret the word rendered "casting down" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;</span>, which is found nowhere else) of some disease like dysentery. It is most suitable to understand this clause as connected with the preceding threat of hunger, and to take the unusual word in the sense of "emptiness." Thus, "Thy emptiness (of stomach) shall remain in thee." Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>)speaks of the famine in the city at the time of its siege. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take hold;</span> rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt remove</span> (<span class="accented">thy goods</span>). This is the second chastisement. They should try to take their goods and families out of the reach of the enemy, but should not be able to save them. The LXX. interprets the verb of escaping by flight. <span class="cmt_word">That which thou deliverest.</span> If by chance anything is carried away, it shall fall into the hands of the enemy (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7, 8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/6-15.htm">Micah 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Here is another judgment in accordance with the threatenings of the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33, 38</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shalt not reap.</span>  The effect may be owing to the judicial sterility of the soil, but more likely to the incursions of the enemy. Trochon quotes Virgil, ' Eel.,' 1:70 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit?<br />Barbarus has segetes? en, quo discordia cives<br />Produxit miseros! his nos consevimus agros!"</span> <span class="cmt_word">Tread the olives.</span> Olives were usually pressed or crushed in a mill, in order to extract the oil; the process of treading; was probably adopted by the poor. Gethsemane took its name from the oil presses there. The oil was applied to the person for comfort, luxury, and ceremony, and was almost indispensable in a hot country. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet wine.</span> Thou shalt tread the new wine of the vintage, but shalt have to leave it for the enemy (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>). The Septuagint has here an interpolation, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "And the ordinances of my people shall vanish away," which has arisen partly from a confusion between Omri, the proper name in the next verse, and <span class="accented">ammi</span>, "my people."

The first part of the verse corresponds to vers. 10-12, the second part to vers. 13-15. <span class="cmt_word">The statutes of Omri.</span> The statutes are the rules of worship prescribed by him of whom it is said (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-25.htm">1 Kings 16:25</a>) that he "wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him." No special "statutes" of his are anywhere mentioned; but he is named here as the founder of that evil dynasty which gave Ahab to Israel, and the murderess Athaliah (who is called in <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>, "the daughter of Omri") to Judah. The people keep his statutes instead of the Lord's (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-22.htm">Leviticus 20:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The works of the house of Ahab</span> are their crimes and sins, especially the idolatrous practices observed by that family, such as the worship of Baal, which became the national religion (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>, etc.). Such apostasy had a disastrous effect upon the neighbouring kingdom of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Walk in their counsels.</span> Take your tone and policy from them. <span class="cmt_word">That I should make thee.</span> "The punishment was as certainly connected with the sin, in the purpose of God, as if its infliction had been the end at which they aimed" (Henderson).
