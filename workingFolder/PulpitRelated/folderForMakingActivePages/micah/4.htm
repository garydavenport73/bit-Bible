The passage, vers. 1-3, occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, The question as to which prophecy is the earlier cannot be settled.

But the term here seems to include Jerusalem itself.

The prophet speaks as if he contemplated a physical change, expressing thereby with singular force the notion that the worship of the true God (of which the temple was the symbol) shall be promulgated among all nations of the world; that from the old Jewish centre of religion a new order of things shall arise, not transitory, nor local, but extending to all time and pervading the utmost parts of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">And people</span> (<span class="accented">peoples</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall flow unto it.</span> The prophet beholds the nations of the world coming up in formal procession to join in the service of the temple. Thus is adumbrated the comprehension of all nations in the Catholic Church. Isaiah says "all nations" in the parallel passage (comp. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a> and <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-22.htm">Zechariah 8:22</a>, and notes there).

This is the reason given by the prophet for the eagerness of the nations to resort to Jerusalem. They would seek instruction at the hand of those authorized to give it (see note on Micah 3:11). <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord.</span> The revelation of Jehovah, the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">From Jerusalem.</span> It is obvious that in a defined sense the gospel sprang from Jerusalem, the place where Christ exercised his ministry, died, rose, ascended; where the apostles received their commission and the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../../par/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>); the gospel being not set up in opposition to the Law, but being its fulfilment and development.

The gospel is a gospel of peace and love, and when "the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ" (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>), peace and love shall everywhere abound. (For the phrase in the text, comp. <a href="../../par/judges/11-27.htm">Judges 11:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-12.htm">1 Samuel 24:12, 15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke strong nations afar off.</span> The word rendered '"rebuke" means here "decide concerning," "act as umpire for."

As commonly, the restoration from captivity and the privileges of Messiah's kingdom are combined in one foreshortened view. But this "remnant" shall be made into a strong nation, which no power shall overthrow (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; 55:22). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall reign over them.</span> Not through an earthly representative, but by himself (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-21.htm">Obadiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In Mount Zion.</span> This prophecy does not necessarily point to any literal earthly fulfilment, but rather to the establishment of Christ's spiritual kingdom, and the revelation of that new Jerusalem which St. John saw "descending out of heaven from God" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - &sect; 6. <span class="accented">After a certain period of calamity and captivity the kingdom of David shall be revived.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, O tower of the flock</span> (<span class="accented">migdal-edar</span>). There was a village with a tower so called near Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a>), and it is thought that Micah refers to it as the home of David and as destined to be the birthplace of Messiah. But the context compels us to consider the expression as a periphrasis for Jerusalem, which the prophet here addressee, declaring that the royal power shall be restored to her. It is evidently the same place as <span class="cmt_word">the stronghold</span> (<span class="accented">ophel</span>, "the hill") <span class="cmt_word">of the daughter of Zion.</span> The name "Ophel" is affixed to the southern spur of Moriah, opposite to the Mount Zion, from which it was separated by the Tyropoeon Valley. It was fortified by Jotham (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>), and on it were the king's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old palace of David, and "the tower that lieth out," or the upper tower (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26, 27</a>). This is probably the "flock tower" mentioned in the text (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, where Ophel and the watch tower are named together); and it is so called as having been originally a place of refuge for flocks, or of observation for shepherds. Micah uses the two expressions to represent the power and dominion of Jerusalem. The propriety of the usa of the term "flock tower" is seen when we remember that David was a shepherd before he was king, and that the Israelites are the sheep of the Lord's pasture. The reference to a flock in the prceeding  verses may also have influenced the prophet's thought. Owing to a slight variation in the reading, the LXX. renders <span class="accented">Ophel</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "dark;" so Jerome, "nebulosa;" Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These translators would refer the term to the ruinous condition of the tower. The first dominion shall come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former, original empire, such as it was in the days of David and Solomon, and which had been lost in later times. The LXX. adds, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: and hence the Greek expositors explain the passage as referring to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. The verb "shall come" is better taken with "the first dominion," and this clause in apposition to the former, "the kingdom of" or "the reign over the daughter of Jerusalem." Sovereignty over Jerusalem, or, as others take it, that appertains to Jerusalem, represents rule over the whole country. In Messiah the glory and power are restored to the throne of David (<a href="../../par/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>).

Is this the reason of thy sorrow? The allusion is to the captivity of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24, 25</a>.). The loss of the king, the representative of the help and favour of God, was a token of the withdrawal of the Divine protection (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy counsellor.</span> A synonym for "king." Cheyne notes that the root of <span class="accented">melech</span> ("king") in Aramaic means "to counsel." In <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> Messiah is called "Counsellor." The Septuagint, treating the word as a collective, renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "thy counsel." <span class="cmt_word">Pangs</span>, etc. The comparison of sorrow of heart to the anguish of labour pains is very common (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; 6:43; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>).

They must leave their city, live shelterless in the open country, be carried to a distant land, even to Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall dwell in the field;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while they are making their way to the place of their captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shall go even to Babylon.</span> This is simple prophecy, and could have been known to Micah only by inspiration. In his day Assyria was the enemy whom Israel had to dread (as <a href="../../par/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5, 6</a>), Babylon being at this time in the position of a conquered country, and not becoming again powerful and independent for another century, So Isaiah prophesied of the captivity to Babylon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3-8</a>), if modern critics have not shaken our faith in the genuineness of that chapter. Micah does not define the time of the Captivity, or the agents; he notes merely the place whither the Jews were at last to be deported. Even in this case "Babylon" may have its typical import, and be taken to represent the great world power arrayed against the chosen race; and the prophecy may look forward to other fulfilments in succeeding ages. Some commentators think that Babylon is here mentioned as the most distant country known, or as a portion of the Assyrian empire. Others suppose that Sargon transported some Israelitish captives to Babylon to replace the rebellious Babylonians whom he exiled to Palestine ('Records of the Past,' 7:29; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), and that thus Micah was naturally led to represent the Judaeans as following their brethren. Whichever explanation we take, there is no reason to consider that the reference to Babylon is the interpolation of a late editor of the prophetic writings. <span class="cmt_word">There shall thou be delivered.</span> In Babylon deliverance shall arise. This prophecy was first literally fulfilled in the return from captivity under Cyrus; it is further fulfilled, under Christ, in the rescue of the true Israelites from the bondage of sin and the world. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - &sect; 7. <span class="accented">Rescued from Babylon, Zion overcomes all enemies in the strength of God.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now also;</span> <span class="accented">and now</span>. A new scene is presented in contrast to the view in vers, 1-4. <span class="cmt_word">Many nations are gathered against thee.</span> Primarily the Assyrians are meant (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-3.htm">Isaiah 33:3</a>), whose armies were composed of various nationalities (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>; see below, <a href="../../par/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>). Pusey thinks that the reference is rather to the attacks of petty enemies, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Maccabean times, and in the Samaritans' opposition to the rebuilding of the temple. Cheyne would place vers. 5-10 in a parenthesis, and connect the present with the ideal description in vers. 1-4. <span class="cmt_word">Let her be defiled;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. profaned, despoiled of her boasted holiness and inviolability. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, "we  will rejoice." The Vulgate, <span class="accented">lapidetur</span>, points to her punishment as an adulteress, which does not suit the context. <span class="cmt_word">Let our eye look upon Zion.</span> The heathen anticipate with malicious pleasure the sight of the humiliation of Jerusalem (comp. <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12, 13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - But the enemies who came to exult over Zion do not know God's design while blindly working it out. God's people are not to be destroyed, but their adversaries. <span class="cmt_word">They know not the thoughts of the Lord.</span> The heathen, who were the instruments of God's wrath against his people, knew nothing of his purpose in thus afflicting them, nor perceived that they themselves were drawn together for punishment. <span class="cmt_word">He shall gather</span> (<span class="accented">hath gathered</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>them as the sheaves into the floor.</span> Their blindness is proved by their not perceiving till too late that God has brought them together before Jerusalem, as sheaves are brought into the threshing floor, in order to be broken up and destroyed (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>). The metaphor is carried on in the next verse. Various are the explanations of the prophet's reference in this prophecy. Many commentators see in it a reference to the destruction of the army of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); others discern a defeat of the Scythians after the return from captivity; others, again, place it in the times of the Maccabees; and others interpret it of the defeat of the mystical adversaries of God's Church adumbrated in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12.htm">Zechariah 12</a>; and <a href="../../par/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20</a>. But the prophet has not one definite event in view, but looks forward to the general conflict between the powers of the world and the Church, of which the historical events and material enemies were the types. Certain historical circumstances may exactly suit the prediction, but they do not exhaust it. And indeed we do wrong to seek for minute and definite fulfilment of particular predictions. Such utterances are often conditional and are modified by subsequent circumstances. The prophets are concerned with great moral truths and the righteous government of the world, and are not always to be interpreted with literal exactness.

The metaphor of threshing is dropped for the moment, but resumed in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">Hoofs</span>. In allusion to the mode of threshing mentioned above (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-9.htm">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">People</span>; <span class="accented">peoples</span>.
