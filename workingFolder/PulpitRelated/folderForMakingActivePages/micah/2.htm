The commandment against coveting (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>) taught the Jews that God regarded sins of thought as well as of action.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">In that day shall <i>one</i> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <i>and</i> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <i>it</i> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day.</span> The evil time mentioned in ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">A parable</span> (<span class="accented">mashal</span>); probably here "a taunting song." The enemy shall use the words in which Israel laments her calamity as a taunt against her (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And lament with a doleful lamentation.</span> The Hebrew gives a remarkable alliteration, <span class="accented">Nahah nehi niheyah</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "Lament a lamentation with melody;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Cantabitur canticum cum suavitate</span>; "Wail a wail of woe." (Pusey). The Syriac coincides with the LXX. By taking the three words as cognates, we get a very forcible sentence; but most modern commentators consider <span class="accented">niheyah</span> not a feminine formation, butniph. of the substantive verb <span class="accented">hayah</span>; hence the words would mean, "Lament with the lamentation;" "It is done," they shall say; "we are utterly spoiled." Thus Cheyne. The lamentation begins with "It is done," and continues to the end of the verse. The verbs are used impersonally - "one shall take up," "one shall lament," "one shall say;" but it is plain that the last two refer to the Jews who shall utter the given dirge, which in turn shall be repeated as a taunt by the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">We are utterly spoiled.</span> According to the second of the explanations of the preceding clause, these words expand and define the despairing cry, "It is done!" In the other case, they are the commencement of the lamentation. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "We are miserably miserable." The complaint is twofold. First, the once flourishing condition of Israel is changed to ruin and desolation. Secondly, <span class="cmt_word">He hath changed</span> (<span class="accented">changeth</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the portion of my people.</span> This is the second calamity: he, Jehovah, passes our inheritance over to the hands of others; the land of Canaan, pledged to us, is transferred to our enemies. Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>, "hath been measured with a line." <span class="cmt_word">How hath he removed it</span> [the portion] <span class="cmt_word">from me!</span> This is better than the alternative rendering, "How doth he depart from me?" Turning away he hath divided our fields;  rather, <span class="accented">to an apostate he</span> <span class="accented">divideth our fields.</span> The apostate is the King of Assyria or Chaldea; and he is so named as being a rebel against Jehovah, whom he might have known by the light of natural religion (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). This was fulfilled later by the colonization of Samaria by a mixed population. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-5.htm">Micah 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore thou.</span> BECAUSE thou, the tyrannical, oppressive grandee (vers. 1, 2), hast dealt with thy neighbour's land unjustly, <span class="cmt_word">therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord</span> (<span class="accented">the line</span>) <span class="cmt_word">by lot</span> (<span class="accented">for a lot</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou shalt have no more inheritance in Israel. The "line" is the measuring line used in dividing land, as <a href="../../par/amos/7-17.htm">Amos 7:17</a>. The reference is to the original distribution of the land by lot in Joshua's time (see <a href="../../par/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In the congregation of the Lord.</span> The Lord's own people, whose polity was now about to be dissolved. Hitzig, Reuss, and Orelli suppose that this verse contains a threat against Micah himself on the part of the ungodly Jews, intimating that they will punish him for presuming to prophesy against them, and that he shall die without leaving children. But this seems far fetched and inadmissible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Prophesy ye not, <i>say they to them that</i> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <i>that</i> they shall not take shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-11.</span> - &sect; 7. <span class="accented">The threat announced in ver.</span> 3 <span class="accented">is further vindicated and applied to individual sinners, with a glance at the false prophets who taught the people to love lies.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy ye not;</span> literally, <span class="accented">drop ye not</span>, as <a href="../../par/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a> (where see note). The speakers are generally supposed to be the false prophets who wish to stop the mouths of Micah and those who are like minded with him. This is probably correct; but these are not the only speakers; the people themselves, the oppressing grandees, who side with the popularity hunting seers, are also included (see note on ver. 12). Say they to them that <span class="cmt_word">prophesy</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thus they prophesy</span> (<span class="accented">drop</span>). Micah uses their own word sarcastically, "Do not be always rebuking; Thus they rebuke." The rest of the verse belongs to the same speakers, and should be rendered, "They shall not prophesy of these things; reproaches never cease." The great men and the false prophets complain of the true prophets that they are always proclaiming misfortune and rebuking the people, and they bid them leave such denunciations alone for the future. The passage is very difficult, and its interpretation has greatly exercised commentators; the above is virtually the explanation of Ewald, Hitzig, Caspari, and Cheyne. Orelli makes the two last clauses Micah's answer to the interdict of the adversaries, "Should one not prophesy of these things? Should reproaches (against the true prophets) never cease?" We prefer the interpretations given above, and consider the prophet's reply to be given in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">O <i>thou that art</i> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <i>are</i> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The prophet answers the interdict of the speakers in the preceding verse by showing that God's attributes are unchanged, but that the sins of the people constrain him to punish. <span class="cmt_word">O thou that art named the house of Jacob.</span> Other renderings of these words are given, viz. "Ah! what a saying!" or, "Is this a thing to be said, O house of Jacob?" The versions of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3b2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., and of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dicit domus Jacob</span>, do not suit the Hebrew. If we adopt the rendering of the Authorized Version, we must consider that Micah addresses those who gloried in their privilege as the family of Jacob, though they had ceased to be what he was, believing and obedient. "O ye who are only in name and title the chosen nation" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33, 39</a>). Professor Driver (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1887) obtains the very suitable meaning, <span class="accented">Num dicendum</span>, "Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the ear of the Lord shortened?" etc., by the change of a vowel point. Somewhat similarly Orelli, "Is this the speech of the house of Jacob?" viz. - Should Jehovah be impatient (as these threats declare him to be)? or were these his doings? The following clause is Jehovah's answer to the objection. <span class="cmt_word">Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?</span> or, <span class="accented">shortened</span>. Is he less long suffering than Jehovah of heretofore? Will you accuse Jehovah of impatience? "Shortness" of spirit is opposed to longanimity (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are these his doings?</span> Are these judgments and chastisements his usual doings that which he delights in? Is the cause of them in him? Is it not in you (<a href="../../par/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">Do not my words do good,</span> etc.? This may be Jehovah's answer to the previous questions, or Micah's refutation of the complaint. The Lord's word is good, his action is a blessing, but only to him who does his commandments (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/1-50.htm">Luke 1:50</a>).

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "before;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">e</span> <span class="accented">contrario.</span> The prophet exemplifies the iniquity which has led God to punish. They are not old offences which the Lord is visiting, but sins of recent and daily occurrence. <span class="cmt_word">My people is risen up as an enemy.</span> A reading, varying by a letter or two, is rendered, "But against my people one setteth himself." But them is no valid reason for altering the received text; especially as, according to Ewald, the present reading may be taken in a causative sense  "They set up my people as an enemy," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the grandees treat the Lord's people as enemies, robbing and plundering them. This translation obviates the difficulty of referring the words, "my people," in this verse to the oppressor, and in ver. 7 to the oppressed. According to the usual view, and retaining the authorized rendering, the meaning is that the princes exhibit themselves as enemies of the Lord by their acts of violence and oppression, which the prophet proceeds to particularize. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, "My people withstood as an enemy." <span class="cmt_word">Ye pull off the robe with the garment;</span> <span class="accented">ye violently strip off the robe away from the garment.</span> The "robe" (<span class="accented">eder</span>) is the wide cloak, the mantle sufficient to wrap the whole person, and which was often of very costly material. The "garment" (<span class="accented">salmah</span>) is the principal inner garment, or tunic. There may be an allusion to the enactment which forbade a creditor retaining the pledged garment during the night (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>, etc.). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "Against his peace they stripped off his skin." <span class="cmt_word">From them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</span> This is probably the correct translation. The grandees rob those who are peaceably disposed, perhaps strip their debtors of their cloaks as they pass quietly along the road. The versions vary considerably from the received Hebrew text. The LXX. (with which the Syriac partially agrees) has, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "To remove hope in the destruction of war;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Eos qui transibant simpliciter convertistis in bellum.</span> From this rendering Trochon derives the paraphrase - Ye treat them as if they were prisoners of war. Hitzig considers that the reference is to fugitives from the northern kingdom who passed through Judaea in their endeavour to escape the evils of the war, leaving wives and children in the hands of the Judaeans. But these treated the refugees harshly.

The "glory" is by some commentators, but not so appositely, referred to vesture exclusively.

The oppressors never repented or tried to make restitution; and so they incurred the special woe of those who injure the poor, the fatherless, and the widow (Pusey).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <i>the multitude of</i> men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13</span> - &sect; 8. <span class="accented">Promise of restorations and deliverance.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The prophet, without any preface, introduces abruptly a promise of restoration after exile, a type of the triumph of Messiah. Some commentators, indeed, regard this and the following verso as the language of the false prophets; others, as a denunciation of punishment, not a promise of deliverance; others, as a late interpolation. But the style is entirely Micah's (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6, 7</a>), the promise is a true one, and such like sudden transitions are common in the prophetical books (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>); so that we need not resort to the hypothesis that some connecting link has dropped out of the text, or that the clause is misplaced; and we are fully justified in considering the paragraph as inserted here in its right position, and as predictive of the restoration of the Jews after captivity. Micah would seem to imply - I am not, indeed, as one of the false prophets who promise you earthly good without regard to your moral fitness for receiving God's bounty; neither am I one who has no message but of woe and calamity; I, too, predict salvation and happiness for a remnant of you after you have been tried by defeat and exile. <span class="cmt_word">I will surely assemble.</span> This presupposes dispersion among the heathen, such as is foretold in <a href="../../par/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>, etc.; Micah 2:4, etc. <span class="cmt_word">O Jacob, all of thee.</span> The promise extends to the whole nation, whether called Jacob or Israel, as <a href="../../par/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <span class="cmt_word">but still only a remnant,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that portion of the nation which should make a good use of adversity, and turn to the Lord with sincere repentance (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>,. etc.). Some see in the term "remnant" an allusion to the people that were left in the northern kingdom after the fall of Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">As the sheep of Bozrah.</span> There were two or more towns so named - one in Sidon, for which see note on Amos 1:12; and another, <span class="accented">hod. Buzrah</span>, on the south border of the Hauran. This is mentioned in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>, as one of the cities of Moab, a district celebrated for its flocks (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>); hence "sheep of Bozrah" may have become a proverbial saying. Many commentators take <span class="accented">Botsrah as</span> an appellative, meaning "fold," in agreement with the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quasi gregem in ovili</span>, and Chaldee, as well as Aquila and Symmachus. The parallelism in the following words seems to favour this view. The LXX. reads differently, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "in trouble." Thus, too, the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">As the flock in the midst of their fold;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as a flock in the midst of its pasture</span>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall make great noise,</span> etc. Like a numerous flock bleating in its fold, so shall the returned Israelites be, prosperous and happy, celebrating their salvation with praise and exultation (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Ezekiel 34:31</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "They shall leap forth from among men," which St. Jerome explains as meaning that the repentant Israelites shall rise above worldly things and aspire to heaven. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breaker is come</span> (<span class="accented">gone</span>) <span class="cmt_word">up before them.</span> Micah depicts Israel's redemption under the figure of release from captivity. The passage is clearly Messianic, and can neither be considered an interpolation nor tortured into a declaration of the siege and ruin of Samaria or Jerusalem. "One that breaketh" is a liberator, a leader that overcomes all obstacles which oppose Israel's return. There may be an allusion in the first instance to a human leader, such as Zerubbabel, in analogy with Moses and Joshua in old time, but the real conqueror intended is generally regarded as Messiah. The Breaker up is supposed to be a title of the Messiah well known to the Jews (see Pusey; and Pearson, 'Exposition of the Creed,' art. 7, note y). This interpretation is rejected by Professor Driver (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April 1887), who considers the "breaker up" to be "either a leader or a detachment of men, whose duty it was to break up walls or other obstacles opposing the progress of an army." But is not this to introduce an agency unknown to these times? Was there any special body of men trained and maintained for this particular duty? This "breaker up," according to Dr. Driver's conception, "advances before them, breaking through the gates of the prison in which the people are confined; they follow, marching forth triumphantly through this open way; their king, with Jehovah at his side (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>), heads the victorious procession (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">They have broken up;</span> <span class="accented">broken forth</span>, or <span class="accented">through.</span> The captives cooperate with their leader. <span class="cmt_word">Have passed through the gate,</span> etc. The prophet speaks of a solemn, regular removal, like the Exodus from Egypt, which no human power can oppose. <span class="cmt_word">Their king.</span> The same as Jehovah in the next clause (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>). He shall lead the host, as he headed the Israelites  when they left the house of bondage (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The prediction may look forward to the final gathering of Israel, which St. Paul seems to contemplate when he writes, "And so all Israel shall be saved" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../micah/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Micah 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Micah 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../micah/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Micah 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Micah 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
