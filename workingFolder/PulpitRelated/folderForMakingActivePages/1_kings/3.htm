It has been assumed (Bunsen, Ewald, Brugsch, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that it was Psusennes II., the last king of that house, on the supposition that he reigned 35 years, (as stated by Eusebius), but according to Africanus, his reign was limited to 14 years. It is wiser to say, therefore, with Mr. Poole (Dict. Bib., "Pharaoh") that this Pharaoh "cannot yet be identified on Manetho's list." It is also impossible to decide whether the alliance was first sought by Solomon with a view to win over a powerful and dangerous neighbour (Thenius), to whose inroads his northern border was exposed, and especially to counteract the influence (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-21.htm">1 Kings 11:21</a>) of Hadad (Plumptre), or whether the marriage was proposed by Pharaoh because the 21st dynasty "had then become very weak" (Rawlinson) and its head desired "friendly relations with the kingdom of Israel, which had grown into a power to be dreaded" (Keil). But we may reasonably suppose that the alliance "must have been to most Israelites a very startling one" (Plumptre.) Egypt (Rahab, <a href="../../par/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>) was to every Israelite a name both of triumph and dread.

"At the same time, it was only when the foreign wives renounced idolatry, that such marriages were in accordance with the spirit of the law" (Keil). As Solomon at this period of his life faithfully observed the law, as he is never blamed for this marriage, and as there is no trace whatever of the introduction of Egyptian rites into Israel, it is a fair presumption that the Egyptian princess conformed to the religion of her adopted country], <span class="cmt_word">and brought her into the city of David</span> [<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a> speaks of her dwelling in "the <span class="accented">house</span> of David," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it would seem, the palace which David had occupied] <span class="cmt_word">until he had made an end</span> [this hardly shows that he had begun to build, as Keil infers.

The idea rather is that just as he was obliged to bring his Egyptian wife into the city of David, because his palace was not yet finished, so the people were compelled to sacrifice on the high places, because the temple was not yet built (Keil), and "the place" where God would put His name had only just been chosen (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-1.htm">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">the people sacrificed</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">were sacrificing, i.e.</span>, habitually, constantly] <span class="cmt_word">in high places</span> [All nations have chosen hill tops for acts of worship, perhaps as being nearer heaven. "Even Abraham built an altar to the Lord on a mountain near Bethel  (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 8</a>; cf. 22:2, 9; 31:54)." And the use of high places for this purpose was not <span class="accented">distinctly</span> condemned in the Law. It is true the Hebrews were commanded to have but one place of sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-9.htm">Leviticus 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 13, 26, 27</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/22-29.htm">Joshua 22:29</a>), and this no doubt was, if not an indirect prohibition, a discouragement of such sanctuaries. It has been held, however, that this command was purely prospective, and it is certainly remarkable that even when the Israelites were settled in the promised land, and the tabernacle was set up (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), altars were constantly built and sacrifices offered on high places, and sometimes, as in the case of Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>), and Manoah (<a href="../../par/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19, 20</a>), by express Divine command. Later on we find Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>), Saul (1 Samuel 13:9; 14:35), David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>), Solomon and Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>), offering sacrifices in various places, which they could not possibly have done had it seemed to them that this was condemned beforehand by the Law. It is highly probable, therefore, that though the contemporaries of Joshua took a different view (as <a href="../../par/joshua/22-15.htm">Joshua 22:15-31</a> proves), the men of a later age excused themselves on the ground stated in the text, that "there was no house built unto the name of the Lord." It has been held by some that "had they not sacrificed and burnt incense on high places, they could not have sacrificed or burnt incense at all" (Bp. Horsley); but this seems to overlook the fact that there was one place provided for sacrifices - the door of the tabernacle &#8212;  and that for some reason or other they sacrificed elsewhere. And the reason, no doubt, was the one assigned by the historian. It should be added that this term "high place" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) came to be used of <span class="accented">all</span> places of worship, not only on heights, but even those in valleys (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>).
