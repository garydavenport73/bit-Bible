This is certainly more probable than that it was due to the prescience of his parents. It may, however, mark their piety and hopes, and may have influenced the life of their son.

But it is by no certain  that the current interpretaioni not the best. Such a play upon words as it involves is not at all uncommon in Hebrew. The meaning  would then be that Elijah , who was, if not by birth, by  domicile, of Tishbe, was one of the strangers - <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span> is found in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">inquilinus</span>, in <a href="../../par/genesis/23-4.htm">Genesis 23:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/12-45.htm">Exodus 12:45</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 47</a>, etc. - or immigrants who had settled in Gilead. The only objection to this rendering - apart from the identity of radicals just <span class="accented">mentioned -</span> is that we should have expected to find <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> written <span class="accented">plene</span>, as the word always is elsewhere. It is alleged by Keil, Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span>, however, that the <span class="accented">stat</span>. <span class="accented">constr</span>. <span class="accented">plur</span>. may well be an exception to the rule, and in support of this view it may be mentioned that the cognate word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, is constantly found in the <span class="accented">constr, plural</span> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (see Gesen., Thessalonians 635). It is clear, then, that the usual <span class="accented">interpretation is</span> by no <span class="accented">means</span> to be lightly set aside. It is certainly preferable to the rendering, "Elijah the stranger," etc., for we have no proof that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> can bear this meaning. In favour of the alternative rendering "the Tishbite of Tishbe," it may be said that it has the support of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and of Josephus (Ant. 8:13. 2), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Nor is it any weighty objection to this view that we now here read of a Tishbe in Gilead: as for the matter of that, we have no undoubted traces of any such place <span class="accented">west</span> of the Jordan; the passage in Tobit (ch. 1:2, LXX.), which is often alleged as proving that there was a Tishbe in Galilee, and from which Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, etc., <span class="accented">conclude</span> that this must be the Tishbi here referred to, being too uncertain to permit us to build any positive conclusions thereupon. See Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1489, 1516. In any case - and it is <span class="accented">perhaps impossible</span> to decide positively between this and the rendering of the A.V. - it is clear that Elijah, even if born in Galilee (but see <a href="../../par/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>, for the belief of the Jews), was trained for his work in Gilead. It was, <span class="accented">therefore</span>, a rugged, unsettled, half-civilized, trans-Jordanic region gave to the world the greatest of its prophets. In this respect he was like Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>), and his antitype the Baptist (<a href="../../par/luke/1-80.htm">Luke 1:80</a>). "The fact that this <span class="accented">mission</span> was entrusted not to a dweller in royal city or prophetic school, but to a genuine child of the deserts and forests of Gilead, is in exact accordance with the dispensations of Providence in other times" (Stanley)] <span class="cmt_word">said unto Ahab</span> [The abrupt way in which Elijah appears upon the scene without a word of introduction or explanation is certainly remarkable. Ewald observes that "his first entry within the <span class="accented">province</span> of the history seems almost as unique and inexplicable as his final disappearance." "Elijah comes in with a <span class="accented">tempest</span>, and goes out with a whirlwind" (Hall). But there is no sufficient ground for believing (Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>.) that a part of our history which described some of his antecedents has been lost to us, or that our text merely recites the <span class="accented">issue</span> of a long conference which Elijah had held with Ahab, for other prophets of this period, Ahijah, Shemaiah, Jehu, are introduced to us in a similar manner, though it must be allowed that their respective ministries were of very different proportions and importance from Elijah's. This sudden appearance, however, is thoroughly characteristic of the man. He presently disappears just as suddenly (ver. 5. Cf. 19:3; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>). It was thought by some in that age that he was borne hither and thither by the Spirit of God! <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>), and men of a later time caught this as one of his prominent characteristics (Ecclus. 48:1-12). Hence, too, the traditions of a still later period, according to which he was "the fiery Phinehas returned to earth, or an angel hovering on the outskirts of the world," Stanley], <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord God of Israel liveth</span> [This formula here occurs for the first time, and it is full of meaning. It asserts first that Jehovah, not Baal, is the God of Israel, and it suggests, in the second place, that he is the <span class="accented">living</span> God, such as Baal was not, and that though ordinarily He keeps silence, He is one who can make His power felt], <span class="cmt_word">before whom I stand</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Whose I am and whom I serve" (<a href="../../par/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>).

See note on 1 Kings 1:28, and cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>. Elijah claims to speak in God's name, and as His ambassador], <span class="cmt_word">there shall not be dew nor rain</span> [Observe the order of the words. Dew is perhaps put first as more essential to vegetable life. Elijah only denounces a plague already threatened in the law as the punishment of idolatry (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>). He came forward as the vindicator and restorer of the law] <span class="cmt_word">these years</span> [An indefinite period. Its duration depended on Elijah's word, and that again on the penitence, etc., of the people. It was because of the obduracy of king and people that it lasted so long] <span class="cmt_word">but according to my word.</span> [The idolatrous priests no doubt claimed for Baal the dominion over nature and absolute control over the clouds and rain - a power which, it may be worth observing, the monks of the convent of St. Katherine at Sinai, where Elijah was, are thought to possess by the Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula. Elijah directly challenges them to a trial of strength. It was as if he had said, "The God that answereth by rain, let him be God." On the fitness  of this miracle, both as a sign and as a punishment, see "Homil. Quart." 5:100,101. "To Eastern and Southern nations, where life and water go always together, where vegetation gathers round the slightest particle of moisture and dies the moment it is withdrawn...the  withholding of rain is the withholding of pleasure, of sustenance, of life itself " (Stanley). "My word" is somewhat emphatic, "<span class="accented">Nisi ego, et non alius vir</span>...  <span class="accented">dixero</span> " (Seb. Schmidt). No doubt there is a special reference to the prophets of Baal. Their inability to remove the ban would prove the impotency of their god. Elijah had <span class="accented">asked</span> for the supernatural powers which he here claims (<a href="../../par/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17, 18</a>).]

It does not seem to have occurred to the prophet that such a calamity as he had denounced against the country almost made his disappearance from the scene a necessity, or if it did, he still waited for instructions. Cf. ver. 9; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>, etc. Not merely was his flight necessary in order to escape persecution or punishment - the search which Ahab instituted for him in part explains his disappearance - but to avoid importunity. It would have been morally impossible for him, though a man of inflexible will (Bahr) to dwell among the people, while the land groaned under the terrible burden which he had laid upon it, and which he alone was able to remove. His life would not have been safe - see <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a> - and the ordeal would have been intolerable. And <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a> shows that the prophet's nature had its weaker side. Wordsworth observes that Elijah's escapes and departures into unknown places are "faint resemblances of the mysterious vanishings of our blessed Lord, after He had delivered some of His Divine messages which excited the anger of the people;" <a href="../../par/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-39.htm">John 10:39</a>] by [Heb. in] <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e., watercourse, wady</span>.

Van de Velde (2. 310, 311) suggests the <span class="accented">Wady Fasael, a</span> few miles to the north. But it is much more probable that it is to be sought in the region east of the Jordan, where, indeed, Eusebius and Jerome place it. It is extremely doubtful whether the Wady-el-kelt, or any Cis-Jordanic ravine, would afford sufficient privacy. Probably Jericho was already rebuilt. As we cannot decide with certainty, we may reasonably conjecture that it is to be sought in Elijah's own country of Gilead, and probably in the <span class="accented">Waddy Alias, i.e.</span>, at no great distance from <span class="accented">Abara</span> (Conder, "Tent-work," p. 230), the Jordan ford nearly opposite Bethshan, where, indeed, an old tradition places it] <span class="cmt_word">that is before</span> [Nothing positive can be concluded from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>.

In support of the received rendering is the very powerful consideration, that it is the interpretation of all the versions (except the Arabic) and of Josephus, who, beyond all question, represented the belief current in his own time (Ant. 8:13. 2). It is also certain that elsewhere in Scripture we find some of the inferior animals supernaturally constrained to effect God's purposes, both of mercy and of judgment (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>;  <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>), though never it must be said, in so rational and methodical a way. Nor can it rightly be contended that the words "I have commanded," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, imply human agency, for elsewhere we find the Almighty <span class="accented">commanding</span> (same word) the serpent (<a href="../../par/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>) and the clouds (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23</a>). It is not, however, a sufficient account of this narrative to say that the prophet merely helped himself to the food which the ravens, whose <span class="accented">habitat</span> was in the Wady Cherith, brought, day by day, to their nests and their young. For, not to insist on the words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">bringing to him</span> (ver. 6), the expressions '" bread (or <span class="accented">food</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) and flesh," and "morning and evening" certainly point to something more than such a fortuitous supply. Whether the <span class="accented">Orebim</span> were "ravens" or not, they certainly acted in an intelligent and rational way: they brought food, that is to say, to the <span class="accented">prophet</span>, and they brought it for months together with unfailing regularity. But against this view the following considerations may be urged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It is hardly in accord with God's <span class="accented">usual</span> way of working, that he should employ birds of the air and those unclean (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:14</a>) and ravenous birds, to feed and succour His saints, rather than men or angels. Of course, no one who does not altogether repudiate the supernatural will deny for a moment that the Almighty <span class="accented">could, had</span> it seemed good to Him, have sustained His prophet by the instrumentality of ravens, just as easily as by any other means. But it appears to be almost a fixed principle of His dealings with men, not to resort to miracles when ordinary means will suffice; or if He does employ miracles, they are never <span class="accented">bizarre</span> or fantastic; they are not such as to suggest the idea of fable or legend; they are invariably the simplest and directest means to the end. And it is submitted that this prolonged and methodical ministry of ravens is altogether unlike God's method of procedure on other occasions. It was an angel succoured Hagar and Ishmael in their need (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>). It was an angel fed Elijah himself, a few years later (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5, 6</a>). They were angels who ministered to our blessed Lord after His long fast (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>). But God's,' chief means," it is always to be remembered, "is man." And it is to be carefully observed that when, about this very time, not one, but one hundred prophets were threatened, just as Elijah was, with death, <span class="cmt_word">no</span> miracle was wrought to save their lives or to supply their wants, but they were fed by human agency, with bread and water (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>). But it is still more significant that elsewhere in this narrative, which is characterized by the profoundest sobriety and reticence, there is what we may almost call a studied absence of the miraculous element. No miracle is wrought to protect Elijah against Jezebel, but he must consult for his own safety by flight. He is sent to the brook Cherith, because there is <span class="accented">water</span> there; in other words, God chose that hiding place in order to obviate the necessity for a miracle. And when the water of the brook dries up, no miracle is wrought to prolong the supply, but the prophet, at the risk of detection, must go forth and seek it elsewhere. And at Zarephath he is fed, not by ravens, but by human agency - by a widow woman. It is true a miracle appears to have been wrought, but the narrative has so little idea of effect and gives so little prominence to the supernatural that even that is doubted. To put the interpretation of "ravens," consequently, on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, provided it will yield any other meaning, appears to be to do violence to the spirit of the context, and to the tenour of Scripture generally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is somewhat difficult to believe that such a prodigy as this, so altogether unique and irregular, would not have been mentioned, had it really happened, elsewhere in Scripture. The absence of all reference thereto is remarkable, when we consider how constantly the ministry of Elijah and its lessons (<a href="../../par/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5, 6</a>) are referred to in the New Testament; but when we observe what an admirable and unequalled illustration of God's providential care this incident would have supplied to some of our Lord's discourses, and notably to that of <a href="../../par/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22</a> sqq., this silence becomes almost suspicious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Despite the practical unanimity of the versions, the interpretation "ravens" has been disputed from very early times. St. Jerome among Christians, Rabbi Judah Hakkodesh and Kimchi amongst Jews - these are but some of those who have repudiated this rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> A very slight change in the vowel points - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - yields the meaning "Arabians." That a fugitive would readily find, not only shelter but sustenance among the Bedouin, whose generous hospitality and loyalty to strangers is proverbial, is obvious, and we knew that about this time some Arab tribes had dealings with the Jews (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>); but without any change at all, a sufficient meaning may be extracted from the word. For we find that somewhere in the <span class="accented">Ciccar</span>, or plain of the Jordan, off which the Wady Cherith lay, was a rock Oreb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <a href="../../par/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>), apparently east of the Jordan (<a href="../../par/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>),  but in any case, at no great distance from Bethabara (<a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>). Now Beth-abara has been identified, almost to a certainty (Conder, "Tent-work," pp. 229-232) with the modern <span class="accented">Abarah</span> (<span class="accented">i.e., passage</span> or <span class="accented">ferry</span>), "one of the main fords of the Jordan just above the place where the Jalud river flowing down the valley of Jezreel and <span class="accented">by Beisan</span>, debouches into Jordan." But we learn from an ancient and independent source, the <span class="accented">Bereshith Rabba</span> (see Dict. Bib. ii. 464), that in the neighbourhood of <span class="accented">Beisan, i.e.</span>, Bethshean, there was anciently a town named <span class="accented">Orbo</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> - a word, it is to be observed, which preserves the radicals of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> transposed. We may safely assume that these two places, Orbo and Oreb, were identical; that the former was the representative at a later day of the latter, or was the shape which the name assumed when bestowed on the hamlet, as distinct from the rock. The inhabitants of this place would, of course, be called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, just as the in. habitants of Ziph were known as <span class="accented">Ziphim</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-1.htm">1 Samuel 26:1</a>), or the men of Zidon as <span class="accented">Zidonim</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). We find, consequently, that this word, which means "ravens," also designates the inhabitants of a village near Bethshean, and probably east of the Jordan; that is to say, in or near Elijah's native country of Gilead. And with this agree the testimonies of Rabbi Judah and Jerome already referred to. The former held that the <span class="accented">Orebim</span> were not ravens at all, but inhabitants of Orbo or the rock Oreb, while the latter says, with equal positiveness, <span class="accented">Orbim, accolae villae in fini-bus Arabum, Eliae dederunt alimenta</span>. It only remains for us to notice the perfect naturalness and consistency of the narrative thus interpreted. Elijah is bidden to go <span class="accented">eastward</span>; to hide in the Wady Cherith, where he would be among tribesmen or friends. For water, there is the brook; for food, the Orbites, whose name would be familiar to him, and whom he may have known, are commanded to feed him. He goes; he is received with Arab hospitality; the Eastern law of <span class="accented">Dakheel</span>, by which any man at any time is entitled to throw himself upon the mercy and protection of another, ensures his safety. The Orebim minister assiduously to his wants. Every morning before the dawn, every evening after dark, they bring him bread and flesh.]

But if we may believe that the prophet was, if not among kinsmen or friends, yet among the pastoral, semi-nomadic people of Gilead, a people, that is to say, like the Bedawin in their instincts and customs, it is easy to understand that having taken him under their protection, they would make a point of visiting him regularly, not only to show him all possible honour, as a person endued with supernatural powers (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-7.htm">1 Kings 18:7, 13</a>), but to afford him some measure of sympathy and companionship.

It is impossible to say how long Elijah remained in the Wady. All we can be sure of is that he must have been more than two rears, out of the three and a haft, at Zare-phath.

He further suggests that possibly she was an Israelite by birth, who had been married to a Phoenician. But all this is extremely doubtful. In the first place, it is noteworthy that the words are, "Jehovah <span class="accented">thy</span> God," words which show that she recognized Elijah, perhaps by his Jewish face, probably by his prophetic dress (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>) as a worshipper of Jehovah.

And the remark that it is hypocrisy to swear by a god in whom one does not believe is disposed of by the consideration that she may well have believed in the Lord as well as in Baal.

When Bahr says that Elijah would never have made this demand, and that still less would the widow have paid any attention to it, had she been a heathen, he appears to forget the words that followed (ver. 14). When one in the garb of a prophet swore, as this man did, by the sacred name, a heathen, with the belief of the heathen in miracles, might well be persuaded that the word was truth.

And it cannot be denied that the literal construction of the words points to a "supernatural and inexplicable multiplication of food" (Rawlinson), similar to those of which the Gospels tell.

The commentators are again at variance as to whether these words imply the use of natural means or not. Those who hold that the child was dead naturally adopt the negative, and some (Keil, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al</span>.) compare with it the action of our Lord in the case of the blind, deaf and dumb (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6, 7</a>). But surely the circumstances and the purpose alike, in these latter cases, were entirely different. The object of the touch, of anointing the eyes, etc., in these cases of healing, appears to have been to awaken a sufficient faith - without which "He could do no miracle" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>) - in men whose infirmities of blindness, deafness, etc., prevented their attaining faith through the ordinary channels of seeing and hearing the merciful and gracious Son of man. But here the child, if not dead, was senseless. We are driven, therefore, to the belief that the prophet "used rational means for warming and revivifying" the child, "not with the hope that of themselves they would prove effectual, but in the sure confidence that God, in answer to his weeping supplication, would impart supernatural force to the natural human agencies," Bahr] <span class="cmt_word">three times</span> [Not only in his prayer but also in this triple repetition do we recognize Elijah's profound conviction that only by the Almighty power of God could the child be restored, and that whatever means were used, God alone could make them effectual.

[Though <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, here translated "soul," constantly means "life," yet it by no means settles the question whether the child was really living or dead.

Massillon's graphic language (vol. 1. p. 91, ed. 1858), showing the contrast between Elijah's procedure and that of our blessed Lord (<a href="../../par/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>), is worth citing here: "Elie ressuscite des morts, il est vrai; mais il est oblige de se coucher plusieurs fois sur le corps de l'enfant qu'il ressuscite; il souffle, il se retrecit, it s'agite; on voit bien qu'il invoque une puissance etrangere; qu'il rappelle de l'empire de ta mort une ame qui n'est pas soumise a savoix, et qu'il n'est pas lui-meme le maitre de la mort et de la vie: Jesus-Christ ressuscite les morts comme il fait les actions les plus communes; il parle en maitre a ceux qui dorment d'un sommeil eternel, et l'on sent bien qu'il est le Dieu des morts comme des vivants, jamais plus tranquille que lorsqu'il opere les plus grandes choses."]
