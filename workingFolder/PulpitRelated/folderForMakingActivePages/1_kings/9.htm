The chronicler gives the true meaning: "all that came into Solomon's heart." It is, however, somewhat doubtful what works are comprehended under this term. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11</a> limits it to the two great erections already described - "all that came into his heart to make <span class="accented">in</span> the house of the Lord and in his own house." But it is by no means certain that our author intended the word to be thus restricted; it is quite possible, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., that some of the buildings mentioned below (vers. 15-19) are to be included. But another question of much greater importance presents itself here. In the Divine communication of vers. 3-9 there is constant and unmistakeable reference to the prayer of dedication (see especially ver. 3); in fact, this message is the <span class="accented">answer</span> to that prayer. It has been held, consequently, that the answer must have followed, if not immediately, yet soon after the petitions were uttered; if so, the dedication must clearly have taken place, not on the completion of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>), but on the completion of the palace, etc.; in other words, the temple must have been finished fully thirteen years before it was consecrated and occupied. Rawlinson suggests that the delay was perhaps occasioned by the circumstance that the furniture of the temple was not till then ready; but <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>, Hebrews, seems to state distinctly that <span class="accented">all</span> the vessels and appointments of the sanctuary were finished at the date there given. Reasons have been given elsewhere (see note on 1 Kings 8:1) in support of the position that the dedication  possibly have been delayed for so long a period, especially after the strenuous efforts which had been made to hurry on the undertaking. Nor does the text, when carefully examined, really require this hypothesis; indeed, it suggests some reasons for thinking that a considerable period must have intervened between the prayer and the response. For the tone of this response is unmistakeably foreboding, if not minatory. Vers. 6-9 contain a stern warning. But there was nothing, so far as we know, in the attitude of Solomon or of Israel at the time of the dedication to call for any such denunciation. At that time, as the prayer surely proves, Solomon's heart was perfect with the Lord his God. But the response has unmistakeably the appearance of having been elicited by signs of defection. The wide difference, consequently, between the spirit of the prayer and the tone of the answer suggests that some time must have elapsed between them, and so far supports the view that the dedication was not delayed until the palace, etc., was completed. And it is also to be remembered that the prayer of dedication had not been without acknowledgment at the time. The excellent glory which filled and took possession of the house was itself a significant and sufficient response. No voice or vision could have said more plainly, "I have heard thy prayer, I have hallowed this house." But when, some thirteen years later - about the very time, that is, when he was at the height of his prosperity, and when, owing to the completion of his undertakings, we might fear lest his heart should be lifted up with pride - when Solomon and his court began to decline in piety and to go after other gods, then this merciful message opportunely refers him to the prayer which he was in danger of forgetting, and warns him of the consequences of the apostasy to which he was tending.]

But here the literal rendering is probably the truer, the meaning being "this house shall be conspicuous, as an example" - so the Vulg. <span class="accented">domus haec erit in exemplum</span>. The LXX. accords with the Hebrew text, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, but the Syriac and Arabic read, "this house shall be destroyed." Keil sees in the words an allusion <span class="accented">implicite</span> to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, and Deuteronomy 28:1, where God promises to make <span class="accented">Israel</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, and says "the blessing will be turned into a curse."

SOLOMON'S BUILDINGS AND UNDERTAKINGS. - So far the historian has spoken exclusively of the two greatest works of Solomon's reign, the Temple and the Palace, and principally of the former. Even the message just related was, as we have seen, the response to the prayer offered when the temple was consecrated. But he now proceeds to mention other proofs of Solomon's greatness, and of the prosperity of his reign - doubtless because the glory of Israel then reached its climax, and the author would be tempted to linger over these details because of the dark contrast which his own time supplied - and this leads him to speak of the means by which all these enterprises were accomplished. The particulars here given are but fragmentary, and are grouped together in a somewhat irregular manner. It would seem as if both this account and that of the chronicler had been compiled from much more copious histories, each writer having cited those particulars which appeared to him to be the most interesting and important. But the design of the historian in either case is evident, viz., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to recount the principal undertakings of this illustrious king, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to indicate the resources which   enabled him to accomplish such ambitious and extensive designs.

It has been conjectured that Hiram had hoped for the noble bay of Acco or Ptolemais (Milman, Rawlinson), but surely he had seaboard enough already. It was rather corn lands he would most need and desire. His disappointment is amply accounted for by the fact that the country assigned him was a hungry and mountainous, and therefore comparatively useless, tract.

Thenius and Ewald regard the word as compounded of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">  =   as nothing</span>; Keil connects it with the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, which would yield the meaning <span class="accented">pawned</span> or <span class="accented">pledged</span>, and hence concludes that, this strip of territory was merely given to Hiram as a security for the repayment of a loan (see below on ver. 14); while Bahr derives it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, an unused root, akin to the preceding - <span class="accented">vinxit, constrinxit</span>, and would see in it a name bestowed on the region because of its <span class="accented">confined</span> geographical position. He does not understand the word, however, as a term of contempt. "How," he asks, "could Hiram give the district a permanent name which contained a mockery of himself rather than of the land?" But the word was obviously an expression of disparagement, if not disgust, which, falling from Hiram's lips, was caught up and repeated with a view to mark not so much his displeasure as Solomon's meanness. But it is not necessary to find a meaning for the word, for it is to be considered that a city Bearing this name existed at that time and in this neighbourhood (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), the site of which, in all probability, is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Kabul</span>, eight miles east of Accho  (Robinson, 3:87, 88; Dict. Bib. 1:237; Thomson, "Land and Book," 1:281, 511). It is possible, indeed, that it may have been one of the "twenty cities" (ver. 11) given to Hiram. And if this city, whether within or without the district of Galilee, were notorious for its poverty or meanness, or conspicuous by its bleak situation, we can at once understand why Hiram should transfer the name to the adjoining region, even if that name, in itself, had no special significance] unto this day.

[This sum is variously estimated at from half a million to a million and a quarter of our money. (Keil, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., and Dict. Bib. 3:1734. It equalled 3000 shekels of the sanctuary (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-26</a>). Keil, who, as we have seen, interprets Cabul to mean <span class="accented">pledged</span>, says somewhat positively that these 120 talents were merely lent to Solomon to enable him to prosecute his undertakings, and that the twenty cities were Hiram's security for its repayment. He further sees in the restoration of these cities (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>, where see note) a proof that Solomon must have repaid the amount lent him. The "sixscore talents "should be compared with the 120 talents of ch. 10:10, and the 666 talents of <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>.]

The LXX. inserts this and the next nine verses after <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>] of the levy [see on 1 Kings 5:13, and 1 Kings 12:18] which Solomon raised; for to build [The punctuation of the A.V. is misleading. The Hebrew has no break - "which Solomon raised for building," etc.] the house of the Lord and his own house and Millo [Heb. invariably, the Millo, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The import of the word is much disputed, but Wordsworth has but slight warrant for say. ing that it means fortress. According to some it is an archaic Canaanitish term, "adopted by the Israelites when they took the town and incorporated into their own nomenclature" (Dict. Bib. 2. p. 367), an idea which finds some support in <a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>. Mr. Grove would further see in it a name for Mount Zion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> being the invariable designation of that part of the city in the Maccabees. But see Joshua, B. J. 5:04.1; Ant. 15:11.5; and Porter, 1. pp. 96, 109. Lewin ("Siege of Jerusalem," p. 256) identifies it with the great platform on which temple and palace alike were built. But the word yields a definite meaning in the (  =  aolm], "the filling in"). Gesenius Hebrew consequently understands it to mean, a rampart (agger) because this is built up and filled in with stones, earth, etc. And the name would have a special fitness if we might suppose that it was applied to that part of the wall of Jerusalem which crossed the Tyropaeon valley. This ravine, which practically divided the city into two parts, would have been the weakest spot in the line of circumvallation, unless it were partly filled in - it is now completely choked up by debris, etc. - and protected by special fortifications; and, if this were done, and we can hardly doubt it was done (see on 1 Kings 11:27), Hammillo, "the filling in," would be its natural and appropriate name. And its mention, here and elsewhere, in connexion with the wall, lends some support to this view] and the wall of Jerusalem [We learn from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a> that David had already built Millo and the wall. Rawlinson argues from <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a> that these repairs had been "hasty, and had now - fifty years later - fallen into decay," and that Solomon renewed them. More probably the words indicate an enlargement of the Tyropaeon rampart, and an extension of the walls. See note there and on chap. 3:1. Solomon, no doubt, wished to strengthen the defences of the capital, on which he had expended so much labour, and where there was so much to tempt the rapacity of predatory neighbours] and Hazor [For the defence of the kingdom he built a chain of fortresses "to form a sort of girdle round the land" (Ewald). The first mentioned, Hazor, was a place of great importance in earlier times, being the "head of all those (the northern) kingdoms" (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). It stood on an eminence - as indeed, for the sake of security, did all the cities of that lawless age (ib., ver. 13 marg.) - overlooking Lake Merom. It was at no great distance from the north boundary of Palestine, in Naphtali (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-36.htm">Joshua 19:36</a>), and being favoured by position, it was strongly fortified - Hazor means fortress - and hence Joshua made a point of destroying it. It appears, however, to have speedily regained its importance, for in <a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2, 17</a> we find it as the capital of Jabin, king of Canaan. It was selected by Solomon as the best site for a stronghold, which should protect his northern border, and as commanding the approach from  Syria. As it is not mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, it would appear to have escaped in the invasion of Benhadad. Possibly it was too strong for him] and Megiddo [<a href="../../par/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. This place was chosen partly because of its central position - it stood on the margin of the plain of Esdraelon, the battlefield of Palestine, and the battles fought there prove its strategical importance, <a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1</a>); <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; Judith 3:9, 10 - and partly, perhaps, because the high road from Egypt to Damascus passed through it. It dominated the passes of Ephraim (see Judith 4:7). It has till recently been identified with el-Lejjun (from Legio. Compare our Chester, etc.) (Robinson, 2:116 sqq.; Stanley, S. and P., p. 347; Porter, 286, 287); but Conder ("Tent-work," p. 67) gives good reasons for fixing the site at the "large ruins between Jezreel and Bethshean, which still bears the name of Mujedd'a, i.e., on the eastern side of the plain] and Gezer [This commanded the approach from Egypt, and would protect the southern frontier of Solomon's kingdom. See <a href="../../par/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-12.htm">Joshua 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>. It stands on the great maritime plain, and is also on the coast road between Egypt and Jerusalem. The site was identified (in 1874) by M. Clermont Ganneau with Tell Jezer. The name means "cut off," "isolated" (Gesen.) "The origin of the title is at once clear, for the site is an out-lier - to use a geological term - of the main line of hills and the position commands one of the important passes to Jerusalem" (Conder, p. 6). The mention of Gezer leads to a parenthesis of considerable length (vers. 16-19). The question of the levy is put aside for the time, whilst the historian explains how it was that the king came to build Gezer. He then proceeds to mention the other towns built during the same reign.

"Sargon gave Cilicia as a dowry with his daughter .... Antiochus Soter gave his claims on Macedonia as a dowry to his step-daughter Phila, when she married Antigonus Gonatas. Coele-Syria and Palestine were promised as a dowry to Ptolemy Epiphanes, when he married Cleopatra, sister of Antiochus the Great," etc. (Rawlinson).

Like Megiddo and Gezer, this town, too, lay on a high road, viz., that between Jerusalem and the sea coast. The selection of Beth-horon for fortification by Solomon is also justified by history - three decisive battles having been fought here (see <a href="../../par/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>; 1 Macc. 3:13-24, and Jos., Bell Jud. 2.19.8.

But here it is to be observed that the chronicler omits these words, and that the Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate render, "in the land of the wilderness." Keil says our text is manifestly corrupt, and certainly the expression is a singular one. Some would, therefore, alter <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5e5;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span>, or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span> (after <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>). Both of the emendations, however, while undoubtedly plausible, are purely conjectural. Wordsworth, who thinks Palmyra is meant, says it is described as "in the land" to indicate that God had fulfilled his promise to extend <span class="accented">the land</span> of Solomon far eastward into the <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>). And a Jewish historian, especially in the time of his country s decadence, might well recount how this great city had once been comprised within the boundaries of Israel. In favour of (2) are these facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it is the reading of the text. It is said, however, that the ancient name of Tadmor was Tamar, and the place clearly owed its name to the <span class="accented">Palm</span> trees. But the name is always <span class="accented">Tadmor</span> in the Palmyrene inscriptions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That this place was "in the wilderness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Judah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That it was "in the land," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it was in close proximity to the places just mentioned.

According to Dean Stanley ("Jewish Ch." 2. pp. 220, 221), "he solemnly entered, not only the temple courts with sacrifices, but penetrated into the Holy Place itself, where in later years none but the priests were allowed to enter, and offered incense on the altar of incense." But this positive statement is absolutely destitute of all basis. For, in the first place, there is nothing in the text to support it. If Solomon ordered, or defrayed the cost of, the sacrifices, etc., as no doubt he did, the historian would properly and naturally describe him as offering burnt offerings. <span class="accented">Qui facit per alium facit per se</span>, and priests are expressly mentioned as present at these sacrifices (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-6.htm">1 Kings 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7-14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-2.htm">2 Chronicles 7:2, 5</a>). We have just as much reason, and no more, for believing that the king built Mille (ver. 24) with his own hands, and with his own hands "made a navy of ships" (ver. 26), as that he sacrificed, etc., <span class="accented">in propria persona</span>. And, secondly, it is simply inconceivable, if he had so acted, that it should have attracted no more notice, and that our historian should have passed it over thus lightly. We know what is recorded by our author as having happened when, less than two centuries afterwards, King Uzziah presumed to intrude on the functions of the priests (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17-20</a>); cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>), and we know what had happened some five centuries before (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>), when men who were not of the seed of Aaron came near to offer incense before the Lord. It is impossible that Solomon could have disregarded that solemn warning without some protest, or without a syllable of blame on the part of our author. And the true account of these sacrifices is that they were offered by the king as the <span class="accented">builder of the temple</span>, and probably throughout his life, by the hands of the ministering priests (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14</a>).

(As to form, etc., of the ships, see Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1014). But no historian could pass over without notice an event of such profound importance to Israel as the construction of its first ships, which, next to the temple, was the great event of Solomon's reign] <span class="cmt_word">in Ezion-geber</span> [lit., the <span class="accented">backbone of a man</span> (or <span class="accented">giant</span>).

The name is probably due, like Shechem (see note on 1 Kings 12:25) to a real or fancied resemblance in the physical geography of the country to that part of the human body. Stanley (S. and P. p. 84) speaks of "the jagged ranges on each side of the gulf." <span class="accented">Akaba</span>, the modern name, also means <span class="accented">back</span>. 2 Chronicles <span class="accented">l.c.</span> says Solomon went to Ezion-geber, which it is highly probable he would do], <span class="cmt_word">which is beside</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>   =  aloud (Gesen., Lex. <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)] <span class="cmt_word">Eloth</span> [lit., <span class="accented">trees</span> akin to Elim, where were <span class="accented">palm</span> trees (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>). The name is interesting as suggesting that Solomon may have found some of the timber for the construction of his fleet here. A grove of palm trees "still exists at the head of the gulf of Akaba" (Stanley S. and P. p. 20). Palms, it is true, are not adapted to shipbuilding, but other timber may have grown there in a past age. But see note on ver. 27. For Elath, see Porter, p. 40; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a> (which shows how it passed into the hand of Israel); <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>.

"Fragments of red coral are forever being thrown up from the stores below, and it is these coral-line forests which form the true 'weeds' of this fantastic sea" (Stanley, S. and P. p. 83). There is also apparently a bottom of red sandstone (<span class="accented">ib</span>. p. 6, note).

(Keil reminds us that Alexander the Great, according to Arrian, had snips transported - in pieces - from Phoenicia to the Euphrates, and that, according to Thucydides (Bell. Pelop. 4:8) the Peloponnesians conveyed 60 ships from Corcyra across the Leucadian Isthmus, etc.) But this, especially when the state of engineering science, etc., among the Hebrews is taken into account, is hardly to be thought cf. It is quite possible, however, that <span class="accented">timber</span> for shipbuilding was floated on the Mediterranean down to the river of Egypt, or some such place, and then transported either to Suez or to Akaba. Probably all that the chronicler means is that Hiram provided the materials and had the ships built. The Israelites, having hitherto had no fleet, and little or no experience of the sea, were unable to construct ships for themselves. And the Tyrians may have seen in the construction of a fleet for <span class="accented">eastern</span> voyages, an opening for the extension of their own maritime trade.

On the other hand, it is alleged that in ancient times India was rich in gold (Ewald, 3. p. 264), and that there are no traces of gold mines in Arabia. The question is discussed at considerable length and with great learning by Mr. Twisleton (Dict. Bib. art. "Ophir"). He shows that it is reasonably certain <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Ophir of <a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a> is the name of some city, region, or tribe in <span class="accented">Arabia</span>, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Ophir of Genesis is the Ophir of the Book of Kings.
