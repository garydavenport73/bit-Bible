Evidently they enjoyed a distinguished rank], <span class="cmt_word">and three hundred concubines</span> [Though not committed to a defence of the accuracy of the figures 700 and 300 (which are clearly <span class="accented">round</span> numbers), it must be said that the reasons alleged for reducing them (as from 700 to 70) are not of much weight. It is hardly correct, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, to say (as Rawlinson) that the numbers are given in <a href="../../par/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a> as "threescore queens and fourscore concubines," for it is obvious that too much importance must not be attached to an <span class="accented">obiter</span> statement ("there are threescore," etc.) in a poetical book, too, and one descriptive of Solomon's youth. The view of Ewald and Keil, again, that these numbers represent the sum total of the inmates of the harem at different periods of Solomon's long reign, rather than the number present at any one time - they would see in the numbers of Song of Solomon <span class="accented">l.c</span>. a statement of the <span class="accented">average strength</span> of the seraglio - though not to be described as evasive, is certainly not the natural interpretation of the words. And these numbers, when we compare them with the establishments of other Eastern potentates, are not found to be at all incredible. The commentators all remind us that Dareius Codomannus, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, took with him on his expedition against Alexander 360 <span class="accented">pellices</span>. Or if ancient history, as Rawlinson affirms, furnishes no strict parallel to these figures, the harems of modern Persia and Turkey at any rate have quite equalled that of Solomon. (See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) It is true that Rehoboam had only 18 wives and 60 concubines (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>), but then Rehoboam was not Solomon. If his harem was but a tithe of his father's, so also were his wealth and his power]: <span class="cmt_word">and his wives turned away his heart.</span> ["Satan hath found this bait to take so well that he never changed since he crept into Paradise" (Bp.

I say <span class="accented">leanings</span>, for it is doubtful to what extent Solomon himself took part in actual idolatry. Both Bahr and Keil - the latter in opposition to the views he held in 1846 - not to speak of others, deny that he shared the idolatries of his wives, and the former labours hard, and on the whole, it seems to me, successfully, to prove that he was only guilty of <span class="accented">sanctioning</span> idolatrous worship in the vicinity of Jerusalem. His arguments, briefly stated, are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is nowhere said that he "served" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) other gods - the expression constantly used of the idolatrous kings; cf. 16:31; 22:53; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Neither the son of Sirach nor the Talmud nor the Rabbins know anything of his personal idolatry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Had he formally worshipped idols, his sin would have been greater than that of Jeroboam as to which, however, see on 1 Kings 12:29 sqq. (The "sin of Jeroboam" lay in "making Israel to sin," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in forcing his people into schismatic and unauthorized worship, rather than in any practices of his own.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The expressions "his heart was <span class="accented">not perfect</span>," below, and "he <span class="accented">went not fully"</span> (ver. 6) are inconsistent with the idea of idolatry. Similarly Ewald says, "There is no evidence from ancient authorities that Solomon, even in advanced life, ever left the religion of Jahveh, and with his own hand sacrificed to heathen gods. All traces of contemporary history extant testify to the contrary" (vol. 3. p. 297). See, however, on ver. 5]: <span class="cmt_word">and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God</span> [It is instructive to compare with this the words of <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-61.htm">1 Kings 8:61</a>, "Let your heart be perfect," etc. Wordsworth remarks that "the defection even of Solomon from God through the influence of his strange wives is one of the best justifications" of the commands of <a href="../../par/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2-4</a>, etc.], <span class="cmt_word">as was the heart of David his father.</span>

He cites <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-2.htm">Deuteronomy 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>; but it should be considered that in the two passages last cited the words are added, "and <span class="accented">served</span> them." And the true explanation would seem to be that, though "it is not stated that Solomon himself offered sacrifice to these idols," yet  "even the building of altars for idols was a participation in idolatry, which was irreconcilable with true fidelity to the Lord" (Keil). Bahr contends that the words "went after Ashtoreth," etc., no more involve personal service than the word "built" in ver. 7 involves personal labour; but both expressions show that he regarded these idolatries not only without disfavour, but with positive approval and practical encouragement. "It is not likely he could be so insensate as to adore such deities, but so far was the uxorious king blinded with affection, that he gave not passage only to the idolatry of his heathenish wives, but furtherance" (Bp. Hall). And the distinction, so far as the sin is concerned, between this and actual idolatry is a fine one. It is not implied, however, that Solomon ever discarded the worship of Jehovah. To the end of his reign he would seem to have offered his solemn sacrifices on the great altar thrice a year. But his heart was elsewhere (ver. 9).] <span class="cmt_word">Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> , <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, probably connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">stella</span>, and <span class="accented">star</span>, by some identified with the planet Venus, by others with the moon, is here mentioned for the first time in the singular (<span class="accented">Ashtaroth</span>, plural, is found in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-10.htm">1 Samuel 12:10</a>, etc.) With Baal, she divided the worship of the Phoenicians, the antiquity of which is evident from <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>. It was really an impure cultus of the reproductive powers (see below on 1 Kings 14:23).

It must not be supposed that the following records stand in due chronological order. The enmities here mentioned did not date from the delivery of the message of which we have just heard; on the contrary, the hatred and opposition of Hadad and Rezon began at an early period, though not the earliest (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a>), of Solomon's reign. It was only in his later life, however, that they materially affected his position and rule; hence it is that they are brought before us at this stage of the history, and also because they are manifestly regarded as chastisements for Solomon's sin.

However "he lifted up his hand;" there was some overt act of rebellion, and Solomon, because of this, and not because of the prophecy (of which, indeed, he may never have heard), sought to slay him. Nor was the king without justification in so doing. Treason must be promptly suppressed, and treason against a benefactor (see ver. 28) is doubly hateful.] <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt</span> [cf. verse 17, and <a href="../../par/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>.

Bib. 3, p. 1288). The date of his accession appears to be somewhere between  <span class="date">988 and 980 B.C.</span> As to his invasion of Palestine, see on 1 Kings 14:25.
