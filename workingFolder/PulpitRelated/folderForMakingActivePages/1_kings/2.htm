The words sound like a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of <a href="../../par/joshua/23.htm">Joshua 23, 24</a>. Perhaps, too, the thought of Joshua suggested to his mind the next words]: <span class="cmt_word">but</span> <span class="cmt_word">be thou strong, and be a man.</span> [Similar, though not identical, words were four times addressed to Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6, 7, 9, 18</a>), and David may well have thought that his son, in entering upon his difficult duties, was not at all unlike Joshua when he succeeded Moses in the leadership of Israel, and that he needed similar encouragement. It is not necessary to  suppose, as Canon Rawlinson does ("Speaker's Com.," vol. 2 p. 489), that in the words, "show thyself a man," we have a reference to Solomon's <span class="accented">youth</span>; for words precisely similar were addressed to each other by the Philistines at Aphek (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). The age of Solomon at his accession is very doubtful. David said, "Solomon my son is young and tender" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>); and Solomon says of himself, "I am a little child" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). Josephus, probably reflecting the tradition of his time, fixes his age at fourteen; Eupolemus at twelve. I incline to think that the words "young and tender" almost forbid the favourite opinion that he was about twenty.]

Bahr paraphrases, "be a true watcher in the service of Jehovah." The words are constantly employed to denote a strict performance of the service of the tabernacle or of the duties of the priests and Levites (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-35.htm">Leviticus 8:35</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-30.htm">Leviticus 18:30</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-7.htm">Numbers 3:7, 8, 25, 28, 32, 38</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/31-30.htm">Numbers 31:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-32.htm">1 Chronicles 23:32</a>, etc.; also <a href="../../par/genesis/26-5.htm">Genesis 26:5</a>). "The reference," says Rawlinson, "is to the charge given to all the kings in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>." But there is no necessity for restricting it to that one injunction.

"The phrase is derived from the Pentateuch" (Wordsworth).

"The context evidently requires 'prosper' here, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>" (Rawlinson). "That thou mayest...  <span class="accented">do wisely"</span> is a very lame and impotent conclusion to ver. 3. We have here an evident reminiscence of <a href="../../par/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; possibly also of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>. David was unquestionably well versed in the Scriptures of that age, of which every king was commanded to make a copy.

In the promise of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. there is no mention of any stipulations, <span class="accented">"If</span> thy children," etc. But both here and in Psalm 122:12, and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>, special prominence is given to the <span class="accented">condition</span> (<span class="accented">dum se bene gesserint</span>), which no doubt was understood, if not expressed, when the promise was first made], saying, <span class="cmt_word">If thy children take</span> <span class="cmt_word">heed to</span> [lit., "keep," same word as in vers. 2, 3] <span class="cmt_word">their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee</span> [lit., "be cut off to thee," as marg. (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/9-23.htm">Joshua 9:23</a>). This word does not occur in the original promise made through Nathan. But it <span class="accented">does</span> occur in subsequent versions of the promise, <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>, as well as here - a strong presumption that the promise must have been repeated to David in another shape], <span class="cmt_word">said he, a man on the throne of Israel.</span> But this thought - that the permanence of his dynasty depended on the faithful observance of the law as it is written in the book of Moses (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in all its details), seems to have reminded the dying man that he himself had not always kept the statutes he was urging his successor to keep. It had been his duty as king, as the power ordained of God, to visit all violations of the law of God with their appropriate penalties; and this duty, in some instances at least, had been neglected. For the law of Moses, reaffirming the primaeval law which formed part of the so called "precepts of Noah" (<a href="../../par/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>) - that ix. blood must be expiated by blood - enjoined, with singular emphasis and distinctness, the death of the murderer (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16, 17, 18, 19, 30-33</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>). It declared that so long as murder remained unpunished, the whole land was defiled and under a curse (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). And it gave the king no power to pardon, no discretion in the matter. Until the red stain of blood was washed out "by the blood of him that shed it" the Divine Justice was not satisfied, and a famine or pestilence or sword might smite the land. Now, David knew all this: he could not fail to know it, for he had seen his country, a few years before, visited by a famine because of the  unavenged blood of the Gibeonites (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>). And yet, one notorious and infamous murderer had not been put to death. The assassin of Abner and of Amasa still polluted the earth, still occupied a distinguished position, and defied punishment. But if the law of Moses was to be kept, then, whatever it might cost, and however painful it might be (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>), he must die; and David, for the welfare of his kingdom, the stability of his throne, and above all, the honour of God, must require his death. No doubt it had often burdened his mind, especially during these last days of feebleness, the thought that punishment had been so long delayed; and therefore, as he sees the end approaching, he feels that he must enjoin upon his successor the fulfilment of that duty which he had been too "weak" to discharge (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>). Hence he proceeds,

But this is just what David did not do; for he is careful to <span class="accented">exclude</span> all mention of his private wrongs. It is true, he says, "what Job did to me," but that is because "the sovereign is smitten in the subject" (Bp. Hall), and because the first of these murders had caused David to be suspected of complicity, while each had deprived him of an able officer. And the words that follow] <span class="cmt_word">what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel</span> [these words are clearly explicative of the "what he did to me."

This was one of those foul murders to which the law expressly denied any right of sanctuary, for it was "with guile" (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>). Joab "took Abner aside in the gate to speak with him peaceably, and smote him there in the abdomen"], <span class="cmt_word">and unto Amasa the son of Jether</span> [or Ithra. In 2 Samuel 27:24, Ithra is called "an Israelite," an obvious mistake for "Ishmaelite," as indeed it stands in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>. Amasa's mother, Abigail, was sister of David and Zeruiah; Amasa, consequently, was Joab's first cousin. This murder was even fouler than that of Abner.

The meaning "make," which Keil assigns to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is not borne out by his references, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a>.

These are, usual (hardly "principal," as Keil) articles of Eastern dress, of the civilian's as well as of the soldier's, and these two are mentioned because, no doubt, the horrible details of the two murders, and especially of the last (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>), had been reported to David. He had been told at the time how the blood of Amasa had spurted on to the girdle of Joab, and streamed down into his sandals, and these details, which no doubt made a deep impression upon his mind, are recited here to show how dastardly and treacherous was the deed, and how thoroughly Joab was stained with innocent blood, blood which cried to heaven for vengeance (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>)].

It needed great discretion in exacting the punishment of death in the case of one who was so powerful, who had such influence with the army and the people, whose crimes had been passed over for so long a time, to whom David was so much indebted - Joab had partly won and had twice preserved for him his crown - and to whom he was allied by ties of blood. To act precipitately or unwisely might provoke a revolution], <span class="cmt_word">and let not his hoar head</span> [see on ver. 9. Joab, though David's nephew, could not have been much his junior, and David was now seventy] <span class="cmt_word">go down to the grave in peace.</span> [He must die a violent, not a natural death, as Corn. a Lap. This expression, no doubt, looks vindictive, but that is solely because  we forget the character of the Old Testament dispensation (as one of <span class="accented">temporal</span> rewards and punishments. See the "Expositor," vol. 3. p. 114), the position of David as king (as the authorized dispenser of punishments, and as responsible to God for dispensing them without fear or favour), and the principles of the Mosaic code (as a <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>, demanding blood for blood, and requiring the magistrates and people to purge themselves of the guilt of blood by demanding "the blood of him that shed it"). Let these considerations be borne in mind, and there is absolutely no warrant for charging David with malevolence. Wordsworth lays stress on the fact that Joab had not repented of his crimes. But we need have recourse to no such suppositions. The Jewish law afforded no place of repentance to the murderer. No amount of contrition would cleanse the land of blood. The <span class="accented">temporal</span> penalty must be paid. In the case of David himself, it was only commuted by special revelation (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10, 13, 14</a>), not remitted.

It was esteemed an essential part of royal munificence throughout the East that the king should feed a large number of retainers and dependants. Cf. the account of Solomon's daffy provision in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>; also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">for so</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in like manner, with <span class="accented">food</span>]; <span class="cmt_word">they came to me</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">came near."</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> often includes, as here, the idea of succour.

Barzillai certainly came (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>), and probably Chimham, but the Speaker's Commentary is mistaken when it says that "Chimham is mentioned as present." He was present at the return of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31, 38</a>, but not necessarily before] <span class="cmt_word">when I fled because of</span> [lit., "from the face of "] <span class="cmt_word">Absalom</span> <span class="cmt_word">thy brother.</span> The mention of Absalom, and those terrible days of revolt and anarchy, when he was constrained to flee for his life, seems to have reminded the dying king of one of the bitterest ingredients of that bitter cup of shame and suffering - the cruel curses of Shimei. He remembers that the sin of Shimei, which was nothing else than treason and blasphemy, has so far escaped punishment. In a moment of generous enthusiasm, he had included Shimei in the general amnesty which he proclaimed on his return (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>). He had thought, no doubt, at the time only of the offence against himself; he had forgotten his sacred and representative character as "the Lord's anointed;" or if he had remembered it (ver. 21) the emotions of that memorable day had obscured or perverted his sense of justice and duty. But he has since realized - and the thought weighs upon his conscience in the chamber of death - that he then pardoned what he had no power to pardon, viz., a sin to which the Mosaic law attached the penalty of death. For blasphemy, as for murder, there was no expiation short of the death of the blasphemer (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10, 13</a>); and blasphemy, like murder, though not perhaps to the same extent, involved those who heard it in its guilt, until they had discharged themselves of their sin upon the head of the guilty (<a href="../../par/leviticus/14-14.htm">Leviticus 14:14</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). But Shimei, so far from having suffered the penalty of the law, had been twice protected against it; twice preserved alive, in defiance of law, by the supreme magistrate, the executor of law. And David, who has been charging his son to keep the law, now realizes that he himself has been a law breaker.

Keil gathers from this word that Shimei "was living at that time in Jerusalem," and refers to ver. 36, which, if anything, implies that he was not. But it is worth suggesting whether Shimei may not be the Shimei to whom reference is made in <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>. (Dean Stanley notices this as a possibility, but alleges nothing in support of it: "Jewish Church," vol. 2 p. 171, note.) We there find Shimei and Rei mentioned as firm adherents of Solomon at the time of Adonijah's rising, and in these words, they "were not <span class="accented">with Adonijah."</span> Surely it is not an unfair presumption - if there is nothing to rebut it - that the Shimei subsequently mentioned as "with" Solomon is the same person. But it has been objected (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Kitto) that the false part that Shimei played at the time of Absalom's revolt would have forever prevented his being recognized and mentioned as one of Solomon's supporters. I very much doubt it. The great influence which Shimei possessed must be taken into account. Nothing shows that influence more clearly than the fact that on the day of David's restoration, despite the part he had taken, and the possible disgrace and danger that awaited him, he could still command the attendance of one thousand men of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). Probably the secret of his influence lay in the fact that he was "of the family of the house of Saul," and possibly, owing to the insignificance of Saul's descendants, was the mainstay and chief representative of that house. And if so, there is nothing at all surprising in the mention of the fact that he was "not with Adonijah," and was subsequently "with" Solomon. It may have been a matter of great consequence at that critical time, which side Shimei - and the thousand or more Benjamites at his back - espoused. And if he <span class="accented">did</span> then declare for Solomon, it could hardly fail to procure him some amount of favour and consideration. He would thenceforward rank amongst the friends of the young king, and the words "thou hast with thee" would accurately describe his position] <span class="cmt_word">Shimei, the son of Gera</span> [another Shimei, the son of Elah, is mentioned (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) as Solomon's officer <span class="accented">in Benjamin.</span> Gera must not be thought of as the "father" of Shimei, except in the sense of ancestor. He was removed from him by many generations, being the son of Bela and the grandson of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>).

He was well known as the son of Benjamin's firstborn (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a>:l), and the head of a house in Benjamin. Professor Gardiner (American translation of Lange, textual note, p. 29), following the LXX. and Vulg., insists that, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (with the article) can only mean "son of the Jaminite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the descendants of Jamin, a son of Simeon." But this is directly contrary to what we read 9 <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, viz., that Shimei was of "a family of the house of Saul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a Benjamite.

It may have lain in one of the waddies branching out from the ravine which runs continuously alongside the steep descent to Jericho. The event narrated in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a> as happening at Bahurim may well have served to inflame Shimei's hatred.

The age of Joab and Shimei would make the Divine Nemesis the more conspicuous. Men would "see that there was a God that judgeth in the earth"] <span class="cmt_word">bring thou down to the grave with blood.</span> The Auth. Version here needlessly alters the <span class="accented">order</span> of the original, which should be followed wherever it can be (and it generally can) without sacrifice of idiom and elegance. In this case the alteration, by the slight prominence it gives to "hoar head" and to "blood," gives a factitious harshness to the sentence. The Hebrew stands thus: "And thou shalt bring down his hoar head with blood to Sheol." This order of the words also exhibits somewhat more clearly the sequence of thought, which is this: "Thou art wise, therefore thou knowest what by law thou shouldest do. What thou shalt do is, thou shalt bring down," etc. It is clear from these words that if David was actuated by malice, by a "passionate desire to punish those who had wronged him" (Plumptre, Dict. Bib., art. "Solomon"), or by "fierce and profound vindictiveness" (Stanley, "Jewish Church," vol. 2. p. 135), he was profoundly unconscious of it. If it was "a dark legacy of hate" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) he was bequeathing to Solomon, then he stands before us in these last hours either as an unctuous hypocrite, or as infatuated and inconsistent to the last degree. That the man who, in his opening words (ver. 3), enjoined upon his son, in the most emphatic manner, a strict and literal obedience to the law of Heaven, should in these subsequent words, delivered almost in the same breath, require him to satiate a long-cherished and cruel revenge upon Joab and Shimei (the latter of whom he had twice delivered from death), is an instance of self contradiction which is almost, if not quite, without parallel. But as I have showed elsewhere, at some length, it is a superficial and entirely erroneous view of David's last words, which supposes them to have been inspired by malice or cruelty. His absorbing idea was clearly this, that he had not "kept the charge of the Lord;" that he, the chief magistrate, the "revenger to execute wrath," by sparing Joab and Shimei, the murderer and the blasphemer, both of whose lives were forfeited to justice, had failed in his duty, had weakened the sanctions of law, and compromised the honour of the Most High. He is too old and too weak to execute the sentence of the law now, but for the safety of his people, for the security of his throne, it must be done, and therefore Solomon, who was under no obligation to spare the criminals his father had spared, must be required to do it. Of the Jewish king it might be said with a special propriety, <span class="accented">"Rex est lex loquens,"</span> and seldom has the voice of law spoken with greater dignity and fidelity than by David in this dying charge. To say, as Harwood does, (Lange, American Trans., p. 32) that "nothing but sophistry can justify his [David's] charge to Solomon, not to let the unfortunate man [Shimei] die in peace," merely shows how imperfectly the writer has entered into the spirit of the theocratic law, that law under which David lived, and by which alone he could be governed and govern others.

In order to propitiate Bathsheba, he exaggerates his loss and disappointment, just as in the next words, in order to put her off her guard, he plays the saint and obtrudes his piety and resignation ]: <span class="cmt_word">howbeit</span> [lit., <span class="accented">and</span>], <span class="cmt_word">the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for it was his from the Lord.</span> [This verse shows pretty clearly that Adoni-jah had not renounced his pretensions to the throne. Despite the pitiful failure of his first conspiracy, and notwithstanding Solomon's generous condonation of his treason, he cannot forget that he was, and is, the eldest surviving son, and had been very near the throne. And as to the kingdom being his brother's by Divine appointment, he cannot have been ignorant of that long ago (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>), yet he conspired all the same.

Bib., art. "Solomon") says this "narrative is not a little perplexing." He then specially remarks on the strangeness of Bathsheba's interceding for Adonijah, and also on Solomon's "flashing into fiercest wrath" at her request. He explains the facts, however, by "Mr. Grove's ingenious theory identifying Abishag with the Shulamite (<a href="../../par/songs/6-13.htm">Song of Solomon 6:13</a>), the heroine of the Song of Songs." It is "the passionate love of Solomon for the fairest among women' that has made Bathsheba, "hitherto supreme, to fear a rival influence, and to join in any scheme for its removal." The king's vehement abruptness is in like manner accounted for. He sees in the request at once an attempt to deprive him of the woman he loves and a plot to keep him still in the tutelage of childhood. Of the ingenuity of this theory no one can doubt, nor yet that it may <span class="accented">possibly</span> represent the actual facts. But it is not necessary, nor does it help much to the explanation of the narrative. Bathsheba's intervention may easily be accounted for by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> her desire to conciliate her son's most formidable rival; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> her feminine interest in a love match; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> her pride, which could not but be flattered, on being assured that her influence with the king was so great. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor is it any more difficult to assign a reason for Solomon's sudden outburst of anger. This request is evidence to him of a fresh plot against his throne, a plot so skilfully laid that its abettors have been able to deceive his own mother, and have made her a tool for its advancement. Surely this is quite enough to account for Solomon's indignation. And the theory of a love story has this disadvantage, that the young king completely ignores it in what follows, all his concern being about the kingdom, and not one word being said about the woman; and again - and this is almost fatal - his mention of Joab and Abiathar, and his subsequent dealings with them, prove conclusively that he suspected a conspiracy against his crown, not a scheme, in which these latter could have had no interest, and therefore no part, to rob him of a mistress] <span class="cmt_word">ask for him the kingdom also</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and ask for him  =  </span> and (you will next) ask for him; or, Aye, ask for him, etc. It was quite natural that Solomon should see in Adonijah's suit for Abishag an indirect, but none the less real or dangerous, attempt to compass his own downfall. For it was one of the customs of  Oriental monarchies that the harem of a sovereign descended to his successor. Thus the impostor Smerdis took possession of the harem of Cambyses (Herod. 3:68), while Darius in turn had some of the wives of Smerdis (3:88). And what is much more to the point, a similar custom obtained amongst the Jews. David, for example, succeeded to the wives, along with the kingdom, of Saul (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a>). And we see from the case of Abner and Rizpah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-8.htm">2 Samuel 3:8</a>), and still more from that of Absalom (ch. 16:22), that to "take possession of the harem was the most decided act of sovereignty" (Lord A. Hervey, Speak. Com. on <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). Now all these instances were of too recent a date, and had attracted far too much attention at the time, to have made it possible for them to have escaped either Solomon's or Adonijah's observation. They manifest "such a close connection in public opinion between the title to the crown and the possession of the deceased monarch's wives, that to have granted Adonijah's request would have been the strongest encouragement to his pretensions" (Rawlinson <span class="accented">in loco</span>). It may be said that Abishag had not really been the concubine of David (ch. 1:4), which is true, and which explains what would otherwise have been the astonishing impiety of Adonijah (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>), and the wonderful complaisance of Bathsheba. There is no warrant for charging Adonijah (as is done by a Lapide, Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al.</span>) with defying the Divine law and seeking an incestuous alliance, for the historian is careful to represent Abishag as David's attendant, and <span class="accented">not</span> as his wife. But it is hardly probable that the nation at large knew this. People generally could only suppose that this fair young girl, chosen out of all the thousands of Israel because of her beauty, had become to all intents and purposes one of the royal seraglio. It is almost a certainty, therefore, that Adonijah's request concealed a plot for using Abishag as a stepping stone to the throne, and Solomon certainly is not to be blamed if he interpreted it by the light of contemporaneous history, and by the usages of his time and country. He knew that his brother had made one deliberate effort to supplant him, and therefore he could only conclude that this was a second, though veiled, attempt to deprive him of his kingdom]; <span class="cmt_word">even for him and for Abiathar the priest, and for</span> <span class="cmt_word">Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span> [The LXX. and other translators appear to have had a slightly different text before them.

We can hardly believe, however, that in these conversations we have the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the speakers If so, how were they preserved and handed down to the author? Even a "court scribe" would hardly catch every turn of expression. And possibly this interview with Bathsheba was private. It would almost seem, from the immediate mention of Joab and Abiathar, as if Solomon had received some prior intimation of this second conspiracy. Possibly his remarkable penetration had divined that mischief was brewing from the bearing of the three, who no doubt would be narrowly watched. Or he may have heard of frequent meetings on their part. Anyhow, Adonijah's suit is to him conclusive proof of a plot].

[Solomon has been accused of "a coldblooded vengeance" and of "that jealous cruelty so common in Oriental despots," in ordering the execution of his brother. But unjustly. It is to be remembered that on the occasion of Adonijah's first rebellion the young monarch had displayed the greatest magnanimity towards him. He might then have justly decreed against him the death which no doubt the conspirators had designed against him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-12.htm">1 Kings 1:12</a>.) Adonijah, by fleeing to the altar, showed that he had good grounds for fearing the avenging sword. He was clearly conscious that he had merited the death of the traitor. But Solomon spared him, during good behaviour. He warned him that "if wickedness were found in him" he should die (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52</a>.) His first treason, consequently, was not to be lost sight of, in case he were guilty of a fresh offence. And now that he is found conspiring again; now that he abuses the royal clemency, and seeks by chicanery and intrigue to snatch his brother's crown, the sentence of death takes effect. This renewed attempt, after failure and forgiveness, must have convinced the king that Adonijah's pretensions would be a standing menace to the peace and prosperity of his empire, and therefore he owed it to himself, to his subjects, and above all to God, who had entrusted him with the crown, to put this restless and dangerous plotter out of the way. To pass over a second offence would be a virtual encouragement of sedition, for it would show that the king was weak and might be trifled with. Adonijah therefore must die, not only in expiation of his treason, but as an example to the subjects of Solomon, that the disaffected, including all Adonijah's partizans, might be awed into obedience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:26-35.

Somewhat similarly Josephus.] <span class="cmt_word">And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> [As Adonijah had done before him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>). His flight is almost certain evidence of his guilt. ("Joab vero seipsum prodidit." Munster.) Why should he flee, if conscious of innocence? Solomon had acted generously before, and Joab would not be aware of David's dying instructions. His two assassinations had remained so long unpunished that he would hardly expect to be called to an account for them now. We have here, therefore, another indication of a second conspiracy, and it is an old belief (Theodorot, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that Joab had suggested to Adonijah the plan of marriage with Abishag. Some have asked why Joab should flee to the altar when his crimes deprived him of the right of the sanctuary. But a drowning man grasps at a straw. It is probable that he never thought of his murders, but only of his treason. According to the Rabbis, death at the altar ensured him burial amongst his fathers (Munster). But, if this were so, it would hardly enter into his calculations.

But it is more probable that he counted on death, and that a feeling of superstition, or of defiance, had decided him to meet his doom there. It should be borne in mind that gross superstition not uncommonly accompanies irreligion and brutality; and it is quite conceivable that Joab hoped for some indefinable benefit from the shadow of the altar, much as the poor Polish Jew expects from burial in Jerusalem. Or his motive may have been defiance, thinking he would "render Solomon odious to the people, as a profaner of the Holy Place" (M. Henry). It can hardly have been to put off forever so short a time the execution, as Bishop Hall imagines.]

Possibly because the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> seemed to Solomon to require it. Both Bahr and Keil think it was that Joab's services to the kingdom might be requited with an honourable sepulture. Was it not rather that the corpse might be removed with all possible haste from the sanctuary, which it defiled, and hidden from view, as one accursed of God, in the earth? So Bishop Hall: "He sends Benaiah to take away the offender both from God and men, from the altar and the world"]; <span class="cmt_word">that thou mayest take away</span> [LXX.

Solomon evidently believed that the guilt of blood was upon him and his house so long as Abner's and Amasa's blood remained unavenged ("The blood that is not required from the murderer will be required from the magistrate." Henry), and that he and his seed might have to answer for it, as Saul's seed had done (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 9</a>). This is one of the many considerations which show that both David and Solomon were actuated not by "cold-blooded vengeance" or "long-cherished resentment" (Stanley), but by a sense of duty. In fact, Jewish law imperatively demanded the death of Joab, and to spare him was to violate all law, and to imperil the throne and the people. "Only a superficial observer," says Ewald, "can here reproach Solomon with needless severity."]

He, at any rate, was not "a murderer whom vengeance suffereth not to live," nor had he taken any part in recent conspiracies. On the contrary, he seems to have lived quietly enough under the eye of the king. And it consequently has the appearance of cruelty and malevolence that Solomon should "press the letter of a compact against him," especially when, by returning to Jerusalem, he placed his life at Solomon's mercy. But it is not difficult to offer a complete justification of Solomon's action in this matter. In the first place, it is to be remembered that cruelty had no part in his character. In his long reign of forty years there are absolutely no evidences of a brutal and tyrannical disposition. There is a strong presumption, consequently, that he was not actuated by cruelty on this occasion, a presumption which finds support in the consideration that Solomon was much too sagacious to prejudice himself in popular estimation at the commencement of his reign by proceedings which would have the least suspicion of vindictiveness. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with this probability the facts of the case entirely agree. Shimei's life, as we have seen, was forfeited to Jewish law. As he had so long been spared, however, the king gave him a gracious respite. The conditions imposed were not onerous. Shimei had but to keep his parole and he would live; to break it and he would assuredly die. He <span class="accented">did</span> break it; not without provocation, it may be, but he broke it, and broke too his solemn oath. It may be said it was hard he should lose his slaves, but better, surely, lose them than his life. Besides, there were other ways of recovering them; or, if he must pursue them in person, his proper course was evidently to ask the king's permission. That he did not do so is in itself a suspicious circumstance, and Solomon might reasonably think that the flight of the slaves was but a <span class="accented">feint</span>, and that Shimei's visit to a foreign court had really a political object. But, be that as it may, the king had protested unto him that if he went any whither, he should most certainly die. When he went, when he despised the royal command and disregarded his sacred oath, how was it possible for Solomon to break his word? To do so would have been inevitably to compromise himself with his subjects, and to forfeit their reverence and trust. Besides, there was a duty he owed to his dead father, and above all, one which he owed to the living God. He had now the opportunity for which his father bade him wait, of putting into force the provisions of the Mosaic law, of requiring the death of the blasphemer, of showing his subjects that the law could not be defied with impunity, that though vengeance was not executed speedily against evil works, still retribution was certain in the long run, and so of teaching them a much needed lesson of obedience and respect of authority. Every consideration, therefore, of justice, morality, filial piety, and religion warranted him in putting Shimei to death. Every imputation of weakness, irresolution, disregard of his plighted word, compromise of his royal dignity, and indifference to religion might justly have been levelled against him, had he interfered between Shimei and the sword of Justice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_kings/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Kings 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Kings 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_kings/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Kings 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Kings 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
