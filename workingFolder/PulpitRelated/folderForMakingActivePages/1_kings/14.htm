The king is now settled at Tirzah (ver. 17). In <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a> we left him residing at Shechem. The time referred to is that somewhat indefinite period mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33, 34</a>. These opening words clearly connect the sickness with Jeroboam's impenitence. What led the king to move his Court to Tirzah, Shechem being, as we have already seen, not only the capital of Ephraim, but "the natural capital of Palestine," "its central situation, its accessibility, and its wonderfully fine water supply" giving it "advantages not enjoyed by any other city in the land" (Conder), we are not told; but it is interesting and instructive to find that it has one conspicuous disadvantage as a capital, viz., that it is "commanded by a hill on either side so close to the town, that the old geographer, Marino Sanuto, in the fourteenth century, considers the place to be untenable by any military force, because stones might be rolled clown upon the houses, from either Ebal or Gerizim" (Conder, p. 16. Cf. <a href="../../par/judges/9-36.htm">Judges 9:36</a>). It is very probable that this consideration suggested the transfer, of which Ewald despaired of discovering the cause ("Hist. Israel," 4:23)] <span class="cmt_word">Abijah</span> [Rawlinson sees in the name, which means "Jehovah is his father," an indication that Jeroboam "did not intend to desert the worship of Jehovah." But the name was probably bestowed long before the schism possibly in Egypt. It is more likely that it connects itself, if with anything, with the message of Jehovah to him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>). But the name was not uncommon - it was borne by a son of Rehoboam (ver. 31; compare <span class="accented">Ahijah</span>, below), and inferences from names must necessarily be precarious] <span class="cmt_word">the son of Jeroboam fell sick</span>. [The historian undoubtedly means us to see the finger of God in this sickness. This was one of the penalties of disobedience (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-22.htm">Deuteronomy 28:22, 58-61</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25</a>].

The identification, however, was only effected in 1838. Conder gives some interesting particulars which lead him to believe that we can identify the very site of the tabernacle. For its history, see <a href="../../par/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1-10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>. Presuming that Tirzah is to be identified with <span class="accented">Teiasir</span> (see on ver. 17) Shiloh would be over thirty miles' distant - more than a day's journey to the queen, as the road involves some toilsome climbing]: <span class="cmt_word">behold, there is Ahijah the prophet</span> [see on 1 Kings 11:29. Shiloh was probably the birthplace, as well as the residence, of Ahijah. It was in the territory of Ephraim (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>), and at no great distance from Bethel. We can only explain Ahijah's continued residence there, after the migration of the God-fearing Israelites to the southern kingdom, not by his great age, but by the supposition that, having been concerned in the transfer of the kingdom to Jeroboam, he felt it a duty to stay and watch his career. And the time has now come when he can be useful. His relations with Jeroboam had apparently so far been good. He had not protested, so far as we know, against the calf worship, but then God had sent another prophet to do that], <span class="cmt_word">which told me that I should be king</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">he spake of me for king</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>over this people.</span> [So that he had already proved himself a true prophet, and so far a prophet of good.]

It is the word translated  "mouldy" in <a href="../../par/joshua/9-5.htm">Joshua 9:5, 12</a>, where Gesenius would render "crumbs." Mouldy bread would hardly be taken as a present.

[At first it strikes us as strange that Jeroboam merely asks what the result will be. He does not petition, that is to say, as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>, for a cure. But we find the same peculiarity, which some would explain by the fatalism of the East, in <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>, and ch. 8:9, In the present instance, however, no such explanation is needed. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jeroboam could hardly ask a favour of a prophet of Jehovah, or hope that it would be granted if he did, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if, as he feared, the sickness was judicial, it would be useless to ask for healing. The infatuation which insisted on a disguise for the purpose of deceiving the prophet, who nevertheless was believed to be able to divine the issue of the sickness, is very characteristic, and has had many parallels since.

The explanation I venture to submit may, I hope, contribute - it can hardly do more - to the elucidation of the text.

It is quite possible (ver. 11) that Jeroboam's wife perished in the wholesale destruction of his house, as it is clear from the severe punishment assigned to her (ver. 12) that she must have shared in his sin. The readiness with which she lent herself to this deceit (ver. 4) also favours the supposition that she had approved his policy. She would then have survived her husband only two years. Keil's explanation, "cut off the house of Jeroboam <span class="accented">this</span> day," appears contrary to actual fact, while to interpret "that day" (with the A.V.) is contrary to Hebrew grammar.]

[This expedition is related with somewhat more of detail in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-4</a>. For Shishak, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>. It was in the twentieth year of his reign that Shishak, once Jeroboam's protector and friend, invaded Palestine. It has been conjectured (Ewald, <span class="accented">al</span>.) that he was incited so to do by Jeroboam, and that the two kings waged war against Judah in concert (see on ver. 30). But as to this Scripture is silent; and moreover if Jeroboam summoned Shishak to his assistance, it is certain that his own kingdom did not altogether escape invasion; and it is perhaps more probable that the divided and weakened state of the country seemed to promise the Egyptian king an easy capture of Jerusalem, of the treasures of which he had doubtless heard. It is well known that a record of this expedition exists in the sculptures and inscriptions of the great temple at Karnak. The <span class="accented">bassi relievi</span> of the temple wall contain over 130 figures, representatives, as the names on the shields show, of so many conquered cities. Amongst these are found three of the "cities for defence" which Rehoboam had built, viz., Shoco, Adoraim, and Aijalon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7-10</a>), while many other towns of Palestine, such as Gibeon, Taanach, Shunem, Megiddo, etc., are identified with more or less of probability. One feature in the list is remarkable, viz., the number of Levitical and Canaanite cities - cities of <span class="accented">Israel</span> - which Shishak is said to have conquered. The usual inference is that such cities, although in Jeroboam's dominions, had nevertheless held out against his rule - the former for religious reasons; the latter, perhaps, in the effort to recover their independence. Mr. Peele, however (Dict. Bib., art. "Egypt" ), accounts for the names on the supposition that Shishak directed, his forces against the northern as well as the southern kingdom, and certainly this seems to agree better with the facts. It is hardly likely that Jeroboam, with the army at his command, would tolerate so many centres of disaffection in his midst. Besides, the Levites, we are told, had migrated in a body to Judah; and the Canaanites at this period can hardly have been in a position to defy any Hebrew monarch. The silence alike of our historian and of the chronicler as to the invasion of Israel is easily accounted for by the fact that Judah bore the brunt of the war.]
