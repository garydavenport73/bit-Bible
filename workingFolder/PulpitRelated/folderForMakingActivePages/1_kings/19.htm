See on 1 Kings 2:23. Stanley appositely recalls to our minds "the tremendous vows which mark the history of the Semitic race, both within and without the Jewish pale, the vow of Jephthah, the vow of Saul, the vow of Hannibal." Rawlinson remarks that this oath was "familiar in the mouths of kings about this time" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-10.htm">1 Kings 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-31.htm">2 Kings 6:31</a>). But it was a standing formula in Israel at all times.

["That queen consort, it seems, was, in effect, queen regent" (Henry). What induced the queen to send this message? For it is obvious that if she really meant to slay Elijah, she took the very means to defeat her purpose by thus forewarning him of her intentions. Some of the older expositors (see, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, Hall, vol. 2. p. 396) have seen in the act a proof of her blind infatuation, of that infatuation which God often employs to defeat the machinations of wicked men, and this view is not to be lightly rejected. That she fully meant what she said is hardly to be doubted. But later writers, including Keil, Bahr, and Wordsworth, see in the threat nothing more than a scheme for ridding herself of the presence of Elijah. They argue that, finding herself unable to put him to death, partly because of the impression he had made upon the people, and partly, too, because of the ascendancy he had just gained over the king, she resolved, by threatening him with instant death, to give him an opportunity for flight. But this view hardly takes sufficiently into account the exasperation, the blind unreasoning hate, or the reckless and desperate character of the queen. It must be remembered that this message was despatched, not after she had had time for thought and calculation, but on the spur of the moment, as soon as she had heard of the massacre of the priests of Baal. That night she could do nothing, nor perhaps could she see her way clearly to compass his death on the morrow. But she will have him know that he is not going to escape her, and that, whatever the effect on her husband, <span class="accented">she</span> is unconquered and unrelenting. She does not stop to argue that he may take the alarm and flee. But she must gratify her impotent rage forthwith by threatening him with death the next day.]

A few MSS. have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> and it certainly suits the context better. Bahr, who interprets, "he saw how matters stood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that she meant him to flee, is not justified in asserting that this expression would require an accusative of the person feared. (See, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., <a href="../../par/genesis/3-10.htm">Genesis 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-15.htm">Genesis 18:15</a>.) Both he and Keil furthermore object to this interpretation that it is contrary to actual fact, neither of them being willing to allow that Elijah was afraid. Bahr says it is inconceivable that the man who had that day faced alone king and priests and the entire people should have become all at once afraid of a bad woman, and he explains Elijah's flight as caused by the discovery that he could not carryon his work of reformation, and by the absence of any intimation (like that of <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>) that he was to stay and hazard his life. But apart from the fact that we are distinctly told that he "went <span class="accented">for his life"</span> (cf. vers. 4, 10), and that his flight seems to have been instant and hurried, history tells of many great souls, hardly less brave than Elijah's, which have succumbed to a sudden panic. Anyhow, it is evident that for the moment Elijah had lost faith in God, otherwise he would certainly have waited for the "word of the Lord," which had hitherto invariably guided his movements (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>). No doubt other emotions besides that of fear were struggling  in his breast, and prominent among these was the feeling of profound disappointment and mortification. It is clear that he had hoped that the "day of Carmel" would turn the heart of the entire nation back again (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37</a>), and the great shout of ver. 39, and the subsequent execution, at his command, of the men who had deceived and depraved the people, might well justify the most sanguine expectations. We can readily imagine, consequently, how, especially after the excitement and fatigues of that day, the threatening and defiant message of the queen would seem the death blow of his hopes, and how, utterly dispirited and broken down, he lost all trust, all faith, and, while fleeing for his life, "requested for himself that he might die" (ver. 4)], <span class="cmt_word">he arose, and went for his life</span> [Keil is compelled, by his refusal to allow that Elijah was actuated by fear, to render these words, "went to commit his soul to God in the solitude of the desert." But the men meaning is settled for us by the like expression in <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-7.htm">2 Kings 7:7</a>; nor does <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a> lend any support to Keil's view.

The A.V. exactly represents the meaning], <span class="cmt_word">and came to Beer-sheba</span> [<a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-33.htm">Genesis 26:33</a>. The southern boundary of Palestine (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-28.htm">Joshua 15:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a>, etc.), allotted to the tribe of Simeon (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2</a>), which tribe, we gather from this passage (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4</a>), was now absorbed in the southern kingdom. (See note on ch. 11:31.) Wordsworth suggests that "perhaps he resorted to Beer-sheba in order to strengthen his faith with the recollection of the patriarchs who had dwelt there," etc. But if that had been his object, a journey to the place was hardly necessary, and it is clear that he only passed through it on his way to Mount Sinai. "Beer-sheba was about 95 miles from Jezreel" - Rawlinson, who adds that Elijah cannot have reached it till the close of the second day. But we must remember that his pace would be regulated by the powers of his servant, probably a mere lad (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), so that it is hardly likely he could travel day and night without stopping to rest], which belongeth to Judah [It is part of Keil's argument in proof that Elijah did not flee from fear of Jezebel, that, had such been the case, he would have remained in the kingdom of Judah, where he would have enjoyed the protection of Jehoshaphat. But it is by no means certain that this prince, considering his close alliance with Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>; cf. 18:10; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>), would have sheltered the prophet. Indeed, it is remarkable, as Blunt has well pointed out (Coincid. pp. 183, 184), that the prophet <span class="accented">never</span> took refuge in the southern kingdom. At one time he found a sanctuary beyond the Jordan; at another in the kingdom of Tyre, but never in the realm of Jehoshaphat. When he does come in haste to Beer-sheba, "it is after a manner which bespeaks his reluctance to set foot within that territory, even more than if he had evaded it altogether." The reason partly was, no doubt, as Wordsworth says, that his mission was to idolatrous Israel. Judah had both priests and prophets of its own], <span class="cmt_word">and left his servant</span> [There is no warrant for the assertion (Stanley) that "one only of that vast assembly remained faithful to him, the Zidonian boy of Zarephath." The identity of this boy with the servant is by no means certain; nor is the defection of the people at all proven] <span class="cmt_word">there</span>. [Probably because he wished to be alone with God; possibly because the boy was then too exhausted to go further, and there was no reason why he should be subjected to the uncertainties and privations of desert life; hardly for the security of both (Blunt). It is perhaps implied, however, that the kingdom of Judah, though not a safe abode for him, would be for his servant. When we remember that this servant never rejoined him, but that presently Elisha took his place, we can scarcely help wondering whether he was afraid to accompany Elijah any longer (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/15-38.htm">Acts 15:38</a>).]

Beer-sheba stands on the fringe of the desert of <span class="accented">Et-Tih</span>. It was not for the sake of security alone that the prophet plunged into the "great and terrible wilderness." It is probable that from the first, "Horeb, the mount of God," was in his thoughts. He may well have seen that he was destined to be a second Moses; that he was raised up to assert and enforce the covenant of which Moses was the mediator. We have seen already that he cites the words spoken to Moses at the bush (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>); that to him as to Moses there was granted an apparition of fire; we now find him rejected as Moses had been before him (<a href="../../par/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25, 35</a>). How natural that, like Moses, he should flee into the land of Midian, to the place where God had spoken With Moses face to face.

It does not, however, afford a complete protection (Thomson, L. and B. vol. 2. pp. 436, 437). Every traveller remarks on its abundance in the desert; it gave a name, <span class="accented">Rithmah</span>, to one of the stations of the Israelites (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-18.htm">Numbers 33:18</a>.

It is noteworthy how both Moses and Elias were precursors of our Lord in a forty days' fast. "The three great fasters met gloriously on Tabor" (Hall). It is not implied that it took the prophet the whole of this time to reach Horeb, which is only distant from Beer-sheba some 130 miles. "There are eleven days' journey <span class="accented">from</span> Horeb, by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnes" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>).

It is just possible that Horeb was already known as "the mount of God" at the time God appeared to Moses there - the whole of the Sinaitic peninsula was sacred in the eyes of the Egyptians; but it is more probable that this designation is used in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>  prophetically, and that it was Bestowed on the Mount of the Law because of the special revelation of the Godhead there (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/19-3.htm">Exodus 19:3, 11, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>, etc.)]

It is perhaps worth remembering that a part of the desert, though at some distance from Horeb; boars at this day the name of <span class="accented">Magharah</span>, or cave. But there is a "narrow fret" pointed out by tradition as the abode of Elijah, on the side of Jebol Muss. "There is nothing to confirm, but there is nothing to contradict, the belief that it may have been in that secluded basin, which has long been pointed out as the spot No scene could be more suitable for the vision which follows" (Stanley). There is, however, one formidable difficulty in the way of this identification, viz., that the cave is only just large enough for a man's body, which does not agree with ver. 18], <span class="cmt_word">and lodged</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> means strictly to <span class="accented">pass the night</span>.

He could not "go forth" in his sleep. That he was to go forth "on the morrow" is equally unlikely see ver. 11, note], <span class="cmt_word">and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</span> [Many writers, Bahr and Keil among them, will not allow that there is aught of reproof in this question, or that Elijah had in any way erred in his hasty flight. The former asks how it comes to pass that the angel, instead of reproving him, succoured and strengthened him (vers. 6, 7), if he was acting in faithlessness or disobedience. But surely it does not follow that God denies all grace and sustenance to His elect servants even if they do, in a moment of despair, forget or distrust Him. Elijah may have been strengthened for this very journey, Because God would meet with him and teach him the lessons of patience and trust he needed to learn, at the "mount of God" itself. And his answer, especially when contrasted with that of ver. 14 (where see note), certainly betrays, not only irritation and despair, but a "carnal zeal which would gladly have called down the vengeance of the Almighty upon all idolaters" (Keil). The question in itself, it is true, does not necessarily impart censure - it might merely mean, "What wouldst thou learn of me?" But when it is remembered that the prophet had been <span class="accented">sent</span> to every other destination by the "word of the Lord," and that he had left Jezreel without any such word - left it in terror and bitter disappointment and sheer distrust of God - it does look as if the words conveyed a gentle reminder that he had deserted the post of duty, and had no right to be there.

It must be confessed that the <span class="accented">prima facie</span> view is that the prophets had been well nigh exterminated. But we must take into account the deep despondency with which Elijah spoke, and remember the correction which his words received (ver. 18)]; <span class="cmt_word">they seek my life, to take it away.</span> [The commentators are hopelessly divided as to the spirit and temper with which these words were spoken. Bahr, as before, is very positive that there is no complaint or murmuring against God on Elijah's part. He contends that the prophet has been led to Sinai simply by the earnest longing for a disclosure concerning the dealings of God, and for instructions as to his future conduct; and this view has the support of other weighty authorities. But it is extremely difficult to resist the conclusion that we have here at the least a "tacit reproof that God had looked on so quietly for such a length of time, and had suffered things to come to such an extremity" (Keil).  St. Paul speaks of him as pleading with God <span class="accented">against Israel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>), said certainly represents the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> he received as a connection. And the idea which this verse, taken in connexion with the prophet's flight (ver. 3) and his prayer (ver. 4), leaves on the unbiassed mind certainly is that in his zeal for God he resented not only the growing corruption of the age, but above all the frustration of his efforts to stay it. What burdened and vexed his righteous soul was that in the very hour of victory, when the people had confessed that Jehovah alone was God, he, the one solitary witness for the truth, should be driven from his post to escape as best he might, and to leave the covenant people to the baneful influence of Jezebel and her army of false prophets. It is the cry which we hear over and over again in the Old Testament, the complaint of the silence and apparent indifference of God, of the persecution of the righteous, and the impunity of evil doers.]

Very similar expression <a href="../../par/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>. What was the object and meaning of this succession of signs? First, let us remember that Elijah was the prophet of deeds. He taught his contemporaries not by word but by act. He is here taught in turn by signs. There passes before him in the mountain hollow, in the black and dark night, a procession of natural terrors-of storm, and earthquake, and fire. But none of these things move him; none speak to his soul and tell of a present God. It is the hushed voice, the awful stillness, overpowers and enchains him. He is to learn hence, first, that the Lord is a God "merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>); and secondly, that as it has been with himself, so it will be with others; the name of the Lord will be proclaimed in a voice of gentle silence (<span class="accented">ib</span>.<span class="accented">, ver</span>. 5). The weapons of His warfare, the instruments of religious progress, must be spiritual, not carnal. Not in fire and sword and slaughter, but by a secret voice speaking to the conscience, will God regain His sway over the hearts of Israel. (See Homiletics.) The striking  similarity between this theophany and that which Moses saw in the same place, or at no great distance from it, must not be overlooked, for this constitutes another link between law giver and law restorer. The proclamation of <a href="../../par/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3, 7</a> is the best exponent of the parable of vers. 11, 12. To each was the vision of God granted after a faithful witness against idolatry, and after a slaughter of idolaters; each was in a clift of the rock; in either case the Lord <span class="accented">passed by</span>; the one was taught by words, the other rather by signs, but the message in each case was the same - that judgment is God's strange work, but that He will by no means clear the guilty (cf. ver. 17).]

He would perhaps be afraid to issue from the shelter of his cave during the tempest and the earthquake, which may have followed directly after the instruction to go forth was given. Possibly there was a lesson for him here also, viz., that amid the din and excitement and torture of drought and famine and fire and blood the commands of God are less likely to be heard in the soul and obeyed, than in the hour of peace and stillness. The drought and famine and sword have their work to do, even as the tempest and the earthquake have theirs; but it is by the voice of mercy and love that the hearts of men are turned back again.

He was to find a hiding place - we find the king of Damascus at war with Ahab, ch. 20. - or possibly a sphere for work, - he would be near Hazael - in the rugged desert which stretches south and east of the Syrian capital. (See Stanley, "Sinai and Palestine," p. 410; Porter's "Five Years in Damascus," vol. 2. p. 254 sqq.) Here, too, the prophet would be at no great distance from his own country.

Hazael, it is barely possible, may have been anointed secretly, like David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2, 13</a>), but all that we gather from Scripture is, that he was called in an indirect way, and certainly not anointed, by Elisha (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-15</a>). Jehu was certainly anointed, but it was neither by Elisha nor Elijah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1, 6</a>), but by one of the sons of the prophets.

There may have been good reasons, of which we know nothing, why Elijah should devolve the appointment of the two kings upon his successor, and we can readily understand that the word "<span class="accented">anoint"</span> was, as in <a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, never meant to be construed literally. For in the first place, we have no record elsewhere of the anointing of any <span class="accented">prophet</span>; and secondly, it is remarkable that when Elijah might so easily have anointed Elisha, he did nothing of the kind. It is clear, therefore, that he understood the word to mean "appoint." And the root idea of anointing, it must be remembered, was the <span class="accented">setting apart</span> for the service of God (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>). Hence it was (Bahr) that vessels (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a> sqq.), and even stones (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>), were anointed. And when we find that these three persons were set apart sooner or later, and in different ways, to fulfil the high purposes of God, that ought to suffice us. The author of this history clearly found no difficulty in reconciling this account and that of <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>. It has also been objected to this charge (Rawlinson) that it is no "<span class="accented">explanation</span> or application of the preceding parable." But this is precisely what it appears to have been intended to be. The prophet is here taught by word much the same lesson that had been conveyed by signs, in the preceding vision. No doubt there are additional particulars - the vision dealt only with principles, the charge descends to details and prescribes duties - but still the great lesson that souls are to be won, that God's kingdom is to be advanced, not by wrath and vengeance, by fire and sword, but by meekness and gentleness, through the reason and the conscience, is proclaimed. Hazael and Jehu, each was God's instrument to punish; each was like the sweeping siena or the devouring fire, each was an engine of destruction; but by neither of these were the hearts Of men turned to the Lord. It was the sword of Elisha, the sword of his mouth (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-16.htm">Revelation 2:16</a>), should constrain men to hide their faces and humble themselves before God] <span class="cmt_word">Hazael</span> [the <span class="accented">seer of God</span>.

Not only are vers. 16, 17 an interpretation, in some sort, of the vision, but they are an answer to Elijah's complaint (vers. 10, 14).

"The prophet's cloak was a sign of the prophet's vocation" (Keil). To cast the cloak to or upon Elisha was therefore an appropriate and significant way of designating him to the prophetic office. "When Elijah went to heaven Elisha had the mantle entire" <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13</a> (Henry).

The latter soon showed his choice by <span class="accented">running</span> after him], <span class="cmt_word">and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.

Indeed, it would have been strange if there had been. A greater readiness to obey the prophetic summons, Elisha could not well have showed. Forthwith, as soon as he realized his call, "he left the oxen and ran after" his newmaster. True, he asks permission - and why should he not? for "grace is no enemy to good nature" - to give a parting embrace to the father and mother to whom he owed his life, and whom he had been required by God to honour. But there is no proof of "a divided heart" here. If he had begged to be allowed to stay and <span class="accented">bury</span> his mother and father (St. <a href="../../par/luke/9-59.htm">Luke 9:59-61</a>) it might have been otherwise. But he suggests nothing of the kind. He says: "One kiss, one farewell, and then I will follow thee." It is a complete mistake, consequently, to interpret Elijah's words to mean, "Go, return to thy ploughing, for why shouldst thou quit it?...  Thou canst remain as thou art" (Rawlinson). Their true meaning, as evidenced by the sequel (ver. 21), clearly was, "Go back and kiss them; why shouldst thou not? <span class="accented">For</span>  what have I done to thee?
