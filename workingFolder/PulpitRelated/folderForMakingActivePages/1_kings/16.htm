It is very probable that he feared opposition such as Zimri and Omri subsequently experienced. And his wars with Asa and with Syria may well have prevented his renewing the undertaking. On the accession of Elah, however, with the usual ambition and impetuosity of youth, it was decided to recommence the siege and to win this city back for Israel.

But, as Bight remarks there is nothing of this in the text, and Zimri's desperate act rather shows daring and contempt of death than effeminacy or sensuality. And <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>) seems to point to a stronghold rather than a seraglio] <span class="cmt_word">of the king's house, and burnt the king's house</span> [probably the palace which Jereboam had built.

Bahr thinks that he had "formerly displayed much partiality for the calf worship." But it is quite as likely that the idea in the historian's mind was that all these events were the bitter fruits of Jeroboam's misguided and impious policy, into the spirit of which, Zimri, like his predecessors, had been baptized. It is interesting to remember here the aspect these repeated revolutions and assassinations would wear to the kingdom of Judah, then enjoying quietness and prosperity under Asa. We cannot doubt for a moment that they were regarded as so many manifestations of the righteous judgment of God, and as the outcomes of that spirit of insubordination and impiety which, in their eyes, had brought about both the division of the kingdom and the schism in the church.]

Nor are vers. 16, 17 fatal to this view, as Bahr maintains, because "all Israel" there clearly means all the army under the command of Omri. It is hardly likely that Tibni was set up by the people of Tirzah, after the death of Zimri, to continue the struggle. The only thing that is certain is that,the hereditary principle being overthrown, the crown appeared to be the legitimate prize of the strongest; and Tibni, who may have occupied a position of importance, or have had, somehow, a considerable following, resolved that Omri should not wear it without a fierce contest], <span class="cmt_word">to make him king</span> [Omri had been already made king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, anointed, ver. 16]; <span class="cmt_word">and half renewed Omri.</span>

Rawlinson proposes to get over the difficulty by rearranging the text. He would attach the first clause of this verse to ver. 22, and read, "And Omri reigned in the thirty-first," etc. But to this there are two serious objections. First, that ver. 23, as it now stands, only follows the usual formula with which a new reign is announced (cf. vers. 8, 15, 29); and, second, it is extremely doubtful whether any prose sentence in the Hebrew ever begins as ver. 23 would then do, "<span class="accented">Reigned</span> <span class="accented">Omri</span> over Israel twelve years." Such a sentence would certainly be quite alien to the <span class="accented">usus</span> <span class="accented">loquendi</span> of our author. We are therefore reduced to the conclusion either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the text here, as in some other instances (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>; cf. 3:1; 13:1, 10, etc.), has suffered at the hands of a reviser, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the numbers have been corrupted in transcription; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the historian expresses himself in a somewhat confused way. Of these suppositions perhaps <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is the most likely. Anyhow, it is clear that the twelve years of Omri's reign are to be counted not from the thirty-first, but from the twenty-seventh year of Asa, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the date of Zimri's death (see vers. 10, 15, 29). The confusion has arisen from the fact that it was not until Tibni was slain, after four years of conflict, that Omri became <span class="accented">sole</span> ruler]: <span class="cmt_word">six years reigned he in Tirzah.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a></div><div class="verse">And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">And he bought</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, after the six years just mentioned. During the four years of anarchy Omri would seem to have retained possession of the capital which he had taken (ver. 18) on Zimri's death. But the palace being burnt and the defences perhaps weakened by the siege, he determined, rather than rebuild it, to found a capital elsewhere] <span class="cmt_word">the hill Samaria</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Shomeron</span>, called by Herod <span class="accented">Sebaste</span>, whence its modern name <span class="accented">Sebustieh</span>. In his selection of Samaria for the seat of government, Omri acted with singular judgment. It has been said that "Shechem is the natural capital of Palestine," and no doubt it enjoys a commanding position and great advantages, but Samaria has even superior recommendations. It is a site with which no traveller can fail to be deeply impressed. Even Van de Velde, who says, "I do not agree with Dr. Robinson and other writers who follow him that the mountain of Samaria presents so admirable a combination of strength, fertility, and beauty, that the like is hardly to be found in Palestine" (vol. 1. pp. 374, 375), nevertheless readily allows its superiority to Tirzah, and remarks on the strength of its position. "Many travellers have expressed a conviction that the spot was in most respects much preferable to the site of Jerusalem" (Kitto). It is a large oval or oblong mound, with a level surface, adapted for buildings, with steep sides to make its position  impregnable, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills. "Samaria is in a position of great strength., and must before the invention of gunpowder have been almost impregnable. It stands some 400 feet above the valley, the sides of the hill being steep and terraced in every direction for cultivation, or perhaps for defensive purposes.. broad and open valleys stretch north and south, and the hill is thus almost isolated," Conder, p. 47, who adds, "Strategical reasons may be supposed to have dictated the choice of the capital of Omri, for on the north the hill commands the main road to Jezreel over a steep pass, on the west it dominates the road to the coast, and on the east that to the Jordan" (p. 49). Grove (Dict. Bib. 3:1099) speaks of "the singular beauty of the spot," and Stanley ("Jewish Church" it. p. 284) justly sees in the selection of this spot a proof of Omri's sagacity. But perhaps the best proof is that which the subsequent history supplies. Shechem and Tirzah had each been tried, and each in turn had been abandoned. But Samaria continued to be the capital so long as the kingdom lasted] <span class="cmt_word">of Shemer for two talents of silver</span> [variously estimated at &pound;500 and &pound;800. This purchase, obviously of the freehold, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in perpetuity, was in contravention of the law of <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>.

The reluctance of the Israelite to part with his patrimony, even to the king, is brought out very strikingly in ch. 21. Shemer, in selling his choice parcel of land for a capital, might well wish to connect his name with it. The fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> means <span class="accented">watch mountain</span> (Gesen.), and that we should have expected a name formed from Shemer to take the form <span class="accented">Shimron - Shomeron</span> would strictly imply an original <span class="accented">Shomer</span> - is not by any means a proof that our historian is at fault in his derivation. For, in the first place, the names Shomer and Shemer are used of the same person in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32, 34</a>. And secondly, nothing would be more in accordance with Jewish ideas than that Omri, in naming the hill after its owner, should give a turn to the word which would also express at the same time its characteristic feature. A pun, or play upon word, was the form which wit assumed amongst the Semitic races (as, indeed, is the case still, see Conder, p. 801), and the form <span class="accented">Shomeron</span> would at once perpetuate the memory of Shemer, and express the hope and purpose of Omri. It is a curious fact that the later Samaritans did play upon this very word, representing themselves as <span class="accented">guardians</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) of the law (Ewald). The Greek form of the name, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, would seem to have been derived through the Chaldee <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> as found in <a href="../../par/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10, 17</a>.]

If the king of Syria spoke truly (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>), the war with that power had been extremely disastrous.

And this reign is recorded at unusual length; in fact, it occupies nearly all the remaining portion of this volume, whereas the reigns of preceding kings have in several instances been dismissed in a few verses. It owes this distinction to the ministry of the great prophet Elijah by which it was marked, and, indeed, was profoundly influenced; but this ministry, it must be remembered, was necessitated by the critical circumstances of the time. It may be that "every age thinks itself a crisis," but no one can fail to see that this was one of the veritable turning points of Jewish history. One of the real "decisive battles of the world" - that between the Lord and Baal - was then fought out. No wonder that our historian felt constrained to chronicle at length the transactions of a reign so pregnant both with good and evil for the people of the Lord and for the faith with which they had been put in trust. Indeed, the same guiding principle which led him to devote so many of his pages to the reign of Solomon, when the theocratic kingdom was at its highest, impelled him to linger over the reign of Ahab when religion was at its lowest ebb. The secular historian, too often like the sundial which "counts no hours save those serene," draws a veil over the time of his country's decadence, or touches its misfortunes with a  light hand. It is only in the inspired records that we have an impartial register both of the glory and shame of a common. wealth.

But the calf worship, however it may have deteriorated in process of time - and it is the tendency of such systems to wax worse and worse - was nevertheless a cult, though a corrupt, and unauthorized, and illicit cultus, of the one true God.

It does not appear that (Keil) he was the brother of Pheles. Pheles, however, was certainly a fratricide. (Rawlinson reminds us that Jezebel was great-aunt to Pygmalion and Dido.) This statement helps to explain Jezebel's fierce and sanguinary character, and at the same time accounts for her great devotion to the gods of her country, and for her determined efforts to establish their impure rites in her husband's kingdom. It was only what one would expect from the child of such a parent] <span class="cmt_word">king of the Zidonians</span> [This alliance, it is extremely probable, was made for purely political reasons, as a counterpoise against the active, ambitious, and encroaching power which had arisen in Damascene Syria.

Reference has already been made to the frequent recurrence of the word in different compound names, and in different parts of Palestine, as showing how widespread must have been his worship at an earlier age. We are also familiar with the word in the names Hanni<span class="accented">bal</span>, Hasdru<span class="accented">bal</span>, etc. Baal was the supreme male god of the Canaanitish races, as Ashtoreth was their great female divinity.

We learn from Dius and Menander that Hiram had raised a golden pillar to Baal in Tyre. Perhaps Ahab may have copied this. But it is probable that this image, which represented the generative powers of nature, was an essential part of the impure worship of Baal. The house and its contents alike were destroyed by Jehu (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>).

It had evidently passed, however, at this date into the possession of Israel. It has been suggested that the transference took place in the reign of Baasha (Rawlinson). But it would seem that from the very first, parts of Benjamin (notably Bethel, <a href="../../par/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>) belonged to the northern kingdom. See Ewald, "Hist. Israel," 4:2, 3. It is not quite clear whether the rebuilding of Jericho is mentioned as a proof of the daring impiety of that age and of the utter contempt with which the warnings of the law were treated, or as showing the ignorance and consequent disregard of law which prevailed. But, on the whole, it seems to be implied that Hiel knew of the threatening of Joshua, and treated it with defiance. It has been suggested that the rebuilding had really been instigated by Ahab, and for his own purposes, hoping thereby to "secure to himself the passage across the Jordan" (Keil), but the text affords but slight warrant for this conjecture]: <span class="cmt_word">he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at the cost of, in the life of, Abiram], <span class="cmt_word">and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord</span> [<a href="../../par/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>], <span class="cmt_word">which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</span> [The exact fulfilment of the prophecy is mentioned, as showing that even in those dark and troublous times God did not leave Himself without witness, and that law could never be violated with impunity.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_kings/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Kings 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Kings 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_kings/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Kings 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Kings 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
