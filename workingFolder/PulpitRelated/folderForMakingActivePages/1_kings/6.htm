Grave doubts are entertained as to its genuineness. Lord A. Hervey (Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 22) says it is "manifestly erroneous." Rawlinson considers it to be "an interpolation into the sacred text" (p. 515). And it is to he observed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> that the LXX. reads 440 instead of 480 years - a discrepancy which is suspicious, and argues some amount of incertitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Origen quotes this verse without these words (Comm. in S.

It is admitted that we have no other instance in the Old Testament where this is done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> It is difficult to reconcile this statement with other chronological notices both of the Old and New Testaments. For taking the numbers which we find in the Hebrew text of the books which refer to this period, they sum up to considerably more than 480 years. The time of the Judges alone comprises 410 years at the least. It should be stated, however, with regard to the <span class="accented">chronology</span> of the period last mentioned <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it only pretends to furnish round numbers - 20, 40, and the like - and evidently does not aim at exactitude; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is good ground for suspecting that the periods are not always consecutive; that in some cases, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they overlap. We are not justified, therefore, because of the dates of the Judges in rejecting this statement. The question of New Testament chronology is somewhat more complicated. In <a href="../../par/acts/13-20.htm">Acts 13:20</a>, St. Paul states the period between the division of Canaan, by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1, 2</a>), and the time of Samuel the prophet as 450 years (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>) But Lachmann, on the authority <span class="accented">of</span> A, B, C (and we may add <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>), considers the received text to be corrupt, and would place <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> Alford, however, treats this reading as "an attempt at correcting the difficult chronology of the verse," and says that "all attempts to reconcile" it with <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> "are arbitrary and forced." If, then, the received text is to stand - and it is to be noticed that the reigns of the Judges, including Samuel, sum up exactly to the period mentioned by St. Paul, 450 years - the interval between the Exodus and the erection of the temple cannot well have been less than 99 or 100 years longer, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, 580 - Josephus makes it  592 - instead of 480 years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The chronology of Josephus - to which by itself, perhaps, no great weight is to be attached, agrees with St. Paul's estimate, and of course contradicts that of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> Nor does it seem to be a valid argument for the retention of the suspected words, that "the precision of the statement is a voucher for its accuracy." (Bahr, who adds, "Not only is the whole number of the years given, but also the year of the reign of the king, and even the month itself," for the genuineness of the later date, "<span class="accented">In the fourth year,"</span> etc., is not questioned.) The remark of Keil that the building of the temple marked a new and important epoch in the history of the chosen people, and so justified an exceptional reference to the birth or emancipation of the nation, though undoubtedly true, will hardly avail much against the considerations alleged above. On the whole, therefore, I confess to the belief that these words are the interpolation of a later hand (of which we shall find traces elsewhere), though it would, perhaps, be premature, with only the evidence now before us, to exclude them from the text. It is certainly noteworthy that such destructive critics as Ewald and Thenius are satisfied as to their genuineness], <span class="cmt_word">in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel</span> [according to the chronology of Ussher, this was A.M. 3000], <span class="cmt_word">in the month Zif</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, May. The word signifies <span class="accented">splendour</span>. The month was probably so called because of the brilliancy of its flowers (Gesen., Keil, al.)], <span class="cmt_word">which is the second month</span> [This explanation is added because before the captivity the months (with the exception of <span class="accented">Abib</span>) appear to have had no regular names, but were almost always designated by numbers. (See, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>). Only four pre-captivity names are recorded, and of these three are mentioned in connexion with the building of the temple, viz., <span class="accented">Zif</span> here and in ver. 37, <span class="accented">Bul</span> in ver. 38, and <span class="accented">Ethanim</span> in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>. It has hence been inferred that these names were not in general use, but were restricted to public documents, etc. (Dict. Bib. if. 416), a supposition which, if correct, would account for the facility with which the old appellations were superseded by post-captivity names. The later name for this month was <span class="accented">Iyar</span> (Targum on <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">that he began</span> [not in Heb.] <span class="cmt_word">to build the house of</span> [Heb. to] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>. [The chronicler mentions the site (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>), "In Mount Moriah ....in the threshing floor of Ornan," etc. We know from the extensive foundations yet remaining that the preparation of the platform on which the temple should stand must have been a work of considerable time and labour, and see Jos., Ant. 8:03.9, and Bell. Jud. 5:05.1. We can hardly be wrong in identifying the remarkable rock known as the <span class="accented">Sakrah</span>, over which the mosque of Omar (<span class="accented">Kubbet-es-Sakrah</span>) is built - the "pierced rock" of the Jerusalem Itinerary - with the threshing floor of Ornan. The reader will find an interesting paper on the site of the temple in "Scribner's Monthly," vol. 11. pp. 257-272. According to Mr. Beswick, whose measurements and conclusions it gives, the <span class="accented">porch</span> stood on the <span class="accented">Sakrah. Mr.</span> Conder, however, urges strong reasons ("Tent Work," pp. 187-9) for placing the <span class="accented">Holy of Holies</span> on the rock. We should then "see the Holy House in its natural and traditional position on the top of the mountain; we see the courts descending on either side, according to the present slopes of the hill; we find the great rock galleries dropping naturally into their right places; and finally, we see the temple, by the immutability of Oriental custom, still a temple, and the site of the great altar still consecrated [?] by the beautiful little chapel <span class="cmt_word">of</span> the chain." But see Porteri. p. 125; Pal. Explor. p. 4, also pp. 342, 343; "Our Work in Palestine," chs. 8. and 9; "Recovery of Jerusalem," ch. 12.<span class="accented">, etc. Quot viatores, tot sententiae.</span>]

Probably at first it signified, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, the length from point of elbow to tip of little or middle finger. But it is obvious that this was an uncertain measure, and hence perhaps arose cubits of different length. According to Gesen. the cubit here mentioned, which was the older or sacred Mosaic cubit (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>), was six palms, while that of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>), the royal Babylonian cubit, was seven, but on this as well as other points the authorities are very far from agreed. "The length of the cubit is one of the most knotty points of Hebrew archaeology" (Dict. Bib. 3, p. 1736). There is a general <span class="accented">consensus</span> of opinion, however in favour of understanding the cubit here mentioned as measuring 18 inches. Fergusson (Dict. Bib. 3:1451) considers this to be beyond question. It is certainly noteworthy that the measurements of Kings and Chronicles, of Ezra and Ezekiel, of Josephus and the Talmud, all agree, and we know that Josephus always uses the Greek cubit of 18 inches. Mr. Conder, however, maintains that the Hebrew cubit amounts to no more than <span class="accented">sixteen</span> inches. He says, "Maimonides tells us that the temple cubit was of 48 barleycorns, and any one who will take the trouble to measure barleycorns, will find that three go to the inch" - which gives 16 inches for the cubit. To this argument, which is not perhaps of much weight, he adds, what is of much greater moment, that "the Galilean synagogues, measured by it, give round numbers" (pp. 187-8)] <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</span> [It thus appears that the temple was but a small - compared with many churches, a <span class="accented">very</span> small - building. But its purpose and object must be considered. It was not for assemblies of the people. The congregation never met <span class="accented">within</span> it, but the worship was offered <span class="accented">towards</span> it. It was a place for the Holy Presence, and for the priests who ministered before it.]

Bahr holds that it had only side walls and cieling (sic), and was entirely open in front; and the fact that no mention is made of any door or opening, though the doors of the other parts of the edifies are all referred to (vers. 8, 31, 33), certainly favours this view, as also does the position of the pillars of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>] <span class="cmt_word">before the temple of the house</span> [The house, or main building (ver. 2), had two parts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">The temple of the house"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>   =   "spacious," hence "magnificent building," "palace," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-28.htm">Proverbs 30:28</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>.

It would certainly be out of all proportion. Towers are generally built about three times the height of the adjoining nave, but this would be six times as high, and moreover the porch did not taper to a point like a Gothic spire. It is much more probable, therefore, that there is a corruption of the text of Chronicles (see on 2 Chronicles 3:4) - errors in numbers are by no means infrequent - than that such a column could be erected to serve as a <span class="accented">porch</span>, or if erected - and this consideration appears to me to be decisive - could have been passed over by our author without notice. It is impossible, however, to say positively what the height of the porch was. Probably 30 cubits, the height of the house. Stanley characteristically puts it down as "more than 200 feet." It may be remarked here that Fergusson, following Josephus and the Talmud, contends that the temple had another building of the same height above it. See Dict. Bib. 3 p. 1456, and note on ver. 20.]

So many chambers could hardly have been required for the "preservation of temple stores and utensils" (Keil), or of offerings (Ewald). Whatever their use, we can hardly suppose that they were wholly without light, though nothing is said about windows. They may have had "fixed lattices."

According to Bahr, it was in order to preserve the great and costly stones of the temple intact; but others, with greater probability, hold that it was because it appeared unseemly to have the side chambers, which were for  semi-secular purposes (cubicles, perhaps), made an actual part of the sacred edifice. Anyhow, it is clear that the beams rested on ledges made in the walls; but whether in the temple wall only, or in the outer wall of the side structure also, is uncertain. The preceding sketch will not only illustrate the difference, but will help the reader to understand the description preceding. In drawing (1) rebatements are showed only in the temple or inner wall, In (2) they are showed in both walls. In (1) the edifice is represented with a fiat; in (2) with a span roof. Keil decides in favour of the first arrangement (1), and Bahr says somewhat positively, "The outer wall of the structure had no rests." In fact, he suggests that the whole of this side building may have been of wood. It must be admitted that we do know that there were rebatements in the wall A, whereas nothing is said as to the outer wall B. It may also be reasonably alleged that the considerations of fitness and sacredness which forbade the insertion of the beams into the sanctuary wall would not apply to the outer wall, which was a part of the side structure only. Against this view, however, may be urged the extreme thickness of wall which this method of building would necessitate. For unless we suppose that the floor of the ground story rested on the rock, and so was quite detached from the building, we must suppose four rebatements, so that if the wall at the top were two cubits wide, it would be no less than six cubits (or nine feet) at the bottom. It is true that the walls of ancient buildings were of extraordinary thickness, but it must also be remembered that the temple was not fifty feet high. However, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-9.htm">Ezekiel 41:9</a> suggests that the outside wall (B) may have been five cubits in thickness, and, if so, the inner wall would hardly be less. Fergusson, therefore, has some justification for putting each wall down as five cubits wide; but on the whole, perhaps, the plan represented in (1) appears the more probable. The historian here digresses for a moment to speak of the remarkable and, indeed, unprecedented way in which the temple was built, The stories were shaped and prepared beforehand in the quarry, so that there was nothing to do on their arrival in the temple area but to fit them into their place in the building.]

It was apparently the belief of the ancients that stones of proper shape and size were provided in their bed by God (so Theodoret and Procopius,) It is inconceivable, however, that no dressing or preparation of any kind would be required; an idea, moreover, which is contradicted by <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>. When Gardiner (in Bahr, American edition) quotes Keil (in his earlier work) as understanding "all unviolated stones of the quarry," he hardly does justice to that author, who straightway adds, "that is, not altogether unhewn stones...  but stones that were so hewn and wrought in the quarry that neither hammer," etc. (see below).

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used of quarrying in 1 Kings 5:31 (Heb.) <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Where was this quarry? The general idea is that it was in the Lebanon. And it is not to be denied that some of the massive substructions and cornerstones of the temple may have been brought from the mountain, along with the wood; but the bulk of the stone, there can be no doubt, was found much nearer home. Some of it, according to the Mishna (<span class="accented">Middoth</span>, 3:4), came from Bethlehem; but we can hardly be mistaken in believing that for the most part it was quarried in Jerusalem itself, under the very temple rock, and out of the vast caverns recovered some years ago by Dr. Barclay (see his "City of the Great King"), the "Royal Caverns" of Josephus. See "Quart. Journal," Pal. Explor. Fund (No. 7.), pp, 373, 374, and cf. p. 34. There are unmistakable evidences of these extensive caverns having served as a quarry. Not only are the walls cut straight, but rude masses are left here and there to support the roof, and, what is still more convincing, there are stones more or less cut out of the rock, and incisions are made where stones are to be quarried. There was no reason why the workmen should go far afield for stone when they had it, and of very excellent quality, at their own doors]: <span class="cmt_word">so that there was neither hammer</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and hammers.</span> Keil understands "finished stones of the quarry, and hammer, and axe." But the word "was built" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), coming as <span class="cmt_word">it</span> does between "quarry" and "hammers," almost forbids this connexion] nor axe  [Heb. <span class="accented">the axe</span>] <span class="cmt_word">nor any tool</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">every tool</span>] <span class="cmt_word">of iron heard in the house, while it was building.</span> [The historian remarks on this, not only because it was so unusual, but with the evident idea that it was a fulfilment of the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of the law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5, 6</a>), which required the <span class="accented">altar</span> to be of virgin stones, untouched by tool of iron. If the quarries are to be identified with the "Royal Caverns," it is easy to understand how the temple rose up in silence.

That this emendation has much in its favour must be allowed, but it seems also certain that we get a perfectly clear meaning from the text as it stands, viz., that "the door (leading to) the middle floor was (on the ground floor) on the right side," etc. It is hardly likely that all the compartments on the ground floor had only one approach, and the doors which communicated with them may well have been passed over as requiring no special notice.

In Palestine, because of the scarcity of timber, no other form is possible. But the temple, as we have seen, was constructed after the model of the tabernacle, and the latter, as the name almost implies, and as necessity would require, had a ridged roof (see Dict. Bib. 3 p. 1453). It does not <span class="accented">necessarily</span> follow, however, as Fergusson assumes, that the temple followed the tabernacle in this respect. It is obvious that when a "<span class="accented">house</span> was built unto the name of the Lord," the form of the tent might be abandoned as inappropriate.

The word (masculine) is here again used of the entire side structure] <span class="cmt_word">against all the house, five cubits high</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, each story was five cubits (7.5 feet). The three stories would altogether measure fifteen cubits, and of course something must be allowed for joists, floors, etc. The entire height of the side structure (exterior) would consequently be about 18 or 20 cubits. And as the house was internally 30 cubits high, the exterior measurement would probably be about 32 cubits. It has hence been inferred that between the side structure and the top of temple wall there would be a clear space of 12 or 14 cubits, in which the windows were inserted. But this is based on the  assumption that the side structure had a <span class="accented">flat</span> roof, which is by no means certain. If the roof leaned against the walls of the house, with a low pitch, there would still be space amply sufficient for the clerestory windows. Rawlinson's diagram (p. 511), which gives 80 cubits as the height from basement to <span class="accented">ridge of roof</span>, and only allows 20 cubits for height of walls, practically makes the house 20 instead of 30 cubits high, for it is hardly likely that it had an open roof. In fact, we know that it had a cieling (ver. 14), which must have been at the height of 30 cubits (see the diagrams on p. 102. In <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> house and side structure are represented with flat, in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with ridged or sloping roofs), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>unless there was an upper chamber above the house, as to which see ver. 20. Rawlinson's diagram has this further defect, that he allows nothing for thickness of joists, floors, and cielings. If we allow one cubit for each floor, then, on his plan, there would be little or no room left for the windows.

Gesenius understands the former, and renders, "<span class="accented">he</span> covered the house," etc. Thenius, "<span class="accented">he</span> fastened the floor," etc. Keil adopts the latter alternative, "it held to the house with cedar beams." It may be urged against this rendering (as also against Thenius's) that beams which merely <span class="accented">rested</span> on the walls would hardly <span class="accented">bind</span> or <span class="accented">hold</span> the side structure to the main building. But it is almost impossible to decide between these interpretations. We may either render "he covered," etc. (with Chald., Vulg.) in which case ver. 10 would agree with ver. 9 (each, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, would refer to the roofing; ver. 9 to roof of temple; ver. 10 to roof of side structure and its stories); or we may take the words to mean "it laid hold of, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, rested on] <span class="cmt_word">the house with timber of cedar.</span> At this point the historian interrupts his description of the building to record the gracious promise made to the king during its erection.

To the ancients the square seemed the most appropriate shape to express the idea of moral perfection. The idea of the cube consequently was that of entire completeness, of absolute perfection. A little light is thrown on this subject by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> among the Greeks. See the quotation from Simonides in Plat. Protag. 334 A; Arist. Rhet. 3:11; Eth. Nic. 1:10, 11, and compare the familiar "<span class="accented">totus teres atque rotundus."</span> The height of the oracle (internally) being only twenty cubits, while that of the house was thirty (ver. 2), several questions of some interest suggest themselves for consideration. It is perhaps  impossible in the present state of our knowledge to arrive at any very positive conclusions, but it may be well, nevertheless, if only to show in how much uncertainty the architecture of the temple is involved, to state them. First among them is this: Was the roof of the temple flat or ridged? (See above on ver. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In either case, was the height of thirty cubits, or any uniform height, maintained throughout, or was the roof of the oracle some ten cubits lower than that of the house? The analogy of the tabernacle, of which the temple was a copy, would lead us to suppose that the ridge - if there was a ridge - of the entire building was level and unbroken, though the analogy of the Gothic church, which, we have already seen, is almost a reproduction of the temple, suggests that the oracle (like the chancel, and, it may be added, like the <span class="accented">adytum</span> of Egyptian temples) may possibly have had a lower roof. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> supposing the same height was maintained from end to end, to what use, if any, was the vacant space of ten cubits (15 feet) between cieling and roof of oracle applied? It has been held by some that there was a chamber here, but that it was empty, being formed, in fact, not for use, but in order to procure the cubical shape of the oracle. Others contend that this upper room, or one which ran the entire length of the building, was designed to serve as a receptacle for the reliques of the tabernacle, and they would identify it with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. (LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>. And untrustworthy as Josephus is when not supported by independent evidence, it is worth mentioning here that beth he and the Talmud "persistently assert that there was a superstructure on the temple equal in height to the lower part" (Fergusson, who, consequently, is of opinion that there undoubtedly was some such superstructure, as in the tomb of Darius, near Persepolis (see Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1456, 1-457), and that it was used for worship (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>), where see note). Bahr, however, argues forcibly against this idea. He says, <span class="accented">inter alia</span>, that there was no approach provided to these chambers; but our account is so manifestly imperfect that this argument is at the best a precarious one. He sees in the "upper chambers" (the Hebrew word is plural) the upper stories of the side structure. He agrees, however, with Ewald that there was a chamber over the oracle, but thinks it was unoccupied. Keil identifies this space with the "upper chambers" of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>, and upon the whole this appears to be the most feasible view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> How was the cieling, whether with or without this upper chamber, and whether at the height of twenty or thirty cubits - how was it supported? For "no cedar beam could be laid across a space of twenty cubits without sinking in the centre by its own weight." Fergusson hence argues that the roof must have been carried on pillars - four in the sanctuary and ten in the hall. He remarks that they were used in the house of the Forest of Lebanon, where they were <span class="accented">less</span> suitable than here]: <span class="cmt_word">and he overlaid it</span> [lit. <span class="accented">made it shine</span>] <span class="cmt_word">with pure gold</span> [marg. <span class="accented">shut up</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">clausit</span>). Cf. <a href="../../par/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15</a> (Heb.)

It is called "shut up gold," not because it was <span class="accented">concealed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but because of the exclusion of impure ingredients (Vulg. <span class="accented">aurum purissimum</span>). The lavish use of gold in the interior of the temple - its weight 600 talents (75,000 lbs.), its value almost incalculable - was not for mere display (for most of it was never seen except by the priests), but was symbolical of light and <span class="accented">purity</span> (<a href="../../par/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>), and stamped the place as the abode of Him who dwelleth in light (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc.</span> The palace of the Lord must be "exceeding magnifical." The overlaying was not gilding, but <span class="accented">laminae</span> of gold were attached to the woodwork with nails. This art was probably derived from Egypt (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11, 13</a>). Egyptian figures ornamented with gold plates are found both in the Louvre and British Museum. See Wilkinson, "Ancient Egyptians," 2. p. 233 sqq.) Rawlinson remarks that "such ornamentation was common in Babylon, in Assyria, and in Media." See <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>; Herod. 1:98; Layard, 2:264. In addition to the gold, the house was garnished with precious stones (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>). Cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2, 8</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">so covered the</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">an</span>] <span class="cmt_word">altar which was of cedar.</span> [The italics in the A.V. lead us to suspect a mistranslation, and such it proves to be. What the writer means, supposing the present text to be retained, is, not that Solomon covered the cedar altar with gold, but that he overlaid the (stone?) altar with cedar. It is true the article is wanting, but this may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that the altar is now mentioned for the first time (Keil). It is much more probable, however, that the text has been slightly corrupted. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Cod. Alex. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), which proves that the Seventy had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> in their text. If so, the absence of the article is at once explained, and an unmeaning repetition in ver. 22 avoided. The mention of the altar - of course it is the altar of <span class="accented">incense</span> that is meant: the altar of burnt sacrifice was outside the building - in connexion with the  oracle is significant. In ver. 22 it is called the "altar that (belonged) to the oracle," because it stood just outside it. In the tabernacle it was placed "before the vail" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-18</a>), and it occupied this position because the incense burned upon it was offered before the Invisible Presence within. It is an argument in favour of the textual emendation suggested above that the altar in the tabernacle was of wood (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>), and that Ezekiel speaks of the "altar of wood" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>), the altar of sacrifice being of earth stones (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24, 25</a>), or brass (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>) If we retain the Received Text we are almost compelled to believe that this altar was also of stone, as they would hardly cover a wooden altar with wood.

Gesen. himself (together with Keil, marg., <span class="accented">al</span>.) understands the doors, "he bolted the doors of the oracle," so as to keep them closed, except on the day of atonement. But the literal rendering is, "he carried over with chains of gold before the oracle," where nothing is said of either boards or doors. The more natural interpretation, therefore, would perhaps be: he carried on the gold plates of the house in chains of gold across the partition, and so fastened it to the side walls.

It is noticeable how olive wood is employed for the cherubim and doors of oracle, and for the posts of the temple doorway; the less precious cedar was used for lining the walls and for Beams, etc., while for the floor and doors of house, the commoner cypress sufficed], <span class="cmt_word">each ten cubits high.</span> [Half the height of the oracle.

In both cases the ark and mercy seat were placed under the overshadowing wings (ch. 8:6). There would be a clear space of eight or nine cubits between the bodies of the cherubim, and the ark only measured 2.5 cubits (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>) in length and 1.5 cubits in breadth. Unlike Ezekiel's cherubim (Ezekiel chs. 1, 10; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>), these had apparently but one face. The cherub was not a simple, but a complex being, having no unalterable and fixed form. See Bahr, Symbolik, 1. pp. 313, 314; Dict. Bib. vol. 1. pp. 301-303.]

It is uncertain whether there were one or more rows of cherubim and palms. Keil, arguing from the analogy of Egyptian temples, contends for two or three rows, but it is doubtful how far the Israelites, notwithstanding their new and intimate relations with the country, would take Egypt and its idolatrous shrines for a model. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> tends to show that the palm trees alternated with the cherubs. The cherubim may have had two faces, such as he describes (ver. 19), the face of a man on the one side, and the face of a young lion on the other side; but if so, they must have differed in form from those of the oracle. Possibly the open flowers formed a border, or were sculptured in festoons, above, and the gourds (or buds) formed a border below (as in the Kouyunjik slab). But as to this the text is silent. But while we are ignorant of the precise form and of the arrangement of these ornamental carvings, we are not wholly in the dark as to their symbolism. For everything in the temple, we may be sure, had a meaning. Let us inquire, then, into the significance of the cherubim, the palms and the flowers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The Cherubim</span> have been regarded by some as symbols of the invisible Godhead, by others as "representations of the heavenly spirits which surround the Lord of glory and set forth psychical life at its highest stage" (Keil); but it seems best to view them as symbols of all animal life, including the highest and perhaps not excluding the thought of Him who is the source and spring of life, the <span class="accented">Anima animantium</span> (cf. ch. 12:28). Hence they are spoken of as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 13, 15</a>, etc.) "the living things" (compare <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6, 8, 9</a>), and even as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> "the life" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-14.htm">Ezekiel 10:14, 15</a>, etc.) The cherubim consequently speak of the great animal kingdom before its Creator. "Creaturely being reaches its highest degree in those which have an <span class="accented">anima</span>, and among these, the lion, the bull, the eagle, and the man are the highest and most complete" (Bahr). These shapes, accordingly, were not inappropriate or unmeaning in a temple raised by the creature to the glory of the Creator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Just as the cherubim speak of animal, so do the <span class="accented">Palms</span> of vegetable life. They are "the princes of the vegetable kingdom" (Linnaeus) "Amongst trees there is none so lofty and towering, none which has such a fair majestic growth, which is so evergreen, and which affords so grateful a shade and such noble fruits - fruits which are said to be the food of the blessed in paradise - as the palm" (Bahr), who also adds that it is said to have as many excellent properties as there are days in the year, and cites Humboldt as designating it the "noblest of plants forms to which the nations have always accorded the meed of beauty." Judaea, he further remarks, is the fatherland of the palm, so much so that the palm in later days became the symbol of Palestine (as on the well known coin with the legend <span class="accented">Judaea capta</span>). The palms, therefore, tell of the vegetable world, and of Him who fashioned its noble and graceful forms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> And very similar was the testimony of the <span class="accented">Flowers.</span> "Flowers and bloom have been, from ancient times to our own, the usual symbols of lifefulness .... So then by the flower work, as well as by the cherubim and the palm trees, was the dwelling of Jehovah, which was adorned therewith, designated as an <span class="accented">abode of life"</span> (Bahr). On the earthly dwelling place of the Eternal, that is to say, were everywhere pourtrayed the various tokens of His Almighty power and goodness. And the significance of each is the same. "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and  were created." They were graved] <span class="cmt_word">within and without.</span> [These words, here and in ver. 30, are generally taken to mean "in the oracle and in the house." But it is worthy of consideration whether they do not rather signify, "in the house and in the porch." The latter was overlaid with gold (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>).

Rawlinson: "the lintel was one-fifth of wall, and each door post one-fifth of its height;" in which case the doorway would of course be a square of four cubits. But perhaps the rendering of A.V. (with which Keil and Bahr also agree) is more natural. The meaning, consequently, would be that the entrance to the oracle, inclusive of the side posts which helped to form it, occupied one-fifth of the extent of the cedar partition. The entrance to the <span class="accented">house</span> (ver. 33) was one-fourth of the wall of the house.]

If the <span class="accented">floors</span> were covered with gold, we may be sure both <span class="accented">walls</span> and <span class="accented">doors</span> would not be without their coating of the precious metal. Our author does not mention the curtain - it is clear that the doors would not dispense with the necessity for a vail - but the chronicler does (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>). It was necessary in order to cover the ark (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-3.htm">Exodus 40:3, 21</a>); hence it was sometimes called "the vail of the covering." But for this, when the doors were opened on the day of atonement, the priest in the holy place might have gazed into the oracle. See on 1 Kings 8:8. The doors opened outwardly (into the house). The vail was suspended within the oracle.]

The doorway, consequently, would be five cubits wide. The effect of the preposition, "<span class="accented">from</span> a fourth," is probably this: The entrance with the side posts subtracted one-fourth from the space of the wall.

Our author does not mention this, but the chronicler does, under the name of "the great court." In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, the former is called the "higher court," because it occupied a higher level] <span class="cmt_word">with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams.</span> [These, it is thought, formed the enclosing <span class="accented">wall</span> of the court (the LXX. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The cedar beams were instead of coping stones. It has been supposed, however (J.D. Michaelis), that these three rows of stone, boarded with cedar, formed the <span class="accented">pavement of</span> the court. But the question at once suggests itself, Why pile three rows of stones one upon another merely to form a pavement, and why hew and shape them if they were to be concealed beneath a stratum of wood? It is a fair inference from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>, that the wall was low enough to permit men to look over it. Fergusson, on the contrary, argues that it must have been <span class="accented">twice</span> the height of the enclosure of the tabernacle, which would give us an elevation of ten cubits (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-18.htm">Exodus 27:18</a>). It is worth suggesting, however, whether, the inner court being raised above the outer, which surrounded it, these stones may not have formed the retaining wall or sides of the platform. As the outer court had gates (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), it also must have had walls. From <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, we gather that there were various chambers in the forecourt. Such were certainly contemplated by David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>); but it is not recorded that Solomon built them. Nor have we any warrant, except the bare assertion of Josephus, for the belief that he built a colonnade or cloister on the east side, such as was known to later ages by the name of "Solomon's Porch" (<a href="../../par/john/10-23.htm">John 10:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>). As to the dimensions of these spaces, we are left to conjecture. If, as in everything else, the dimensions of the tabernacle were doubled, then the court of the priests would measure 200 cubits from east to west, and 100 cubits from north to south. It should be stated, however, that in the temple of Ezekiel, the proportions of which, in the present instance, may well he historical, both courts are represented as perfect squares. Rawlinson inadvertently puts down the length (along the side of temple) at 100 cubits, and the breadth (ends of temple) at 200. The outer court would probably be twice as large as the inner, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, 400 x 200 cubits. But all this is necessarily uncertain.]
