The close connexion which exists in the original is interrupted by the division of chapters. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a> we read, "So was he seven years in building it." <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a> then proceeds, "And he was building his  own house thirteen years." The much longer period occupied in the erection of the royal palace is easily accounted for. In the first place, the buildings were much larger, and the undertaking altogether was a much more extensive one (ver. 2). Then, though seven years only were consumed in the actual building of the temple, yet preparations for the work had been made, both by David and Solomon, for a long time beforehand. Lastly, a special force of labourers would appear to have been employed on the temple, while it is probable that they wrought at the palaces in greatly diminished numbers. So that the longer period spent over his own house does not argue selfishness or worldliness on Solomon's part. On the contrary, it speaks well for his piety that he built the temple first and urged on that sacred work with so much vigour. The thirteen years date from the completion of the seven years of <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>. That is to say, the building of the temple and palace together occupied twenty years, as is expressly stated in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>. It is therefore one of Stanley's reckless statements that the palace "was commenced at the same time as the temple, but not finished till eight years afterwards"], <span class="cmt_word">and he finished all his house.</span> [By Solomon's "house" we are not to understand his private palace, or residence proper, alone (see ver. 8), but a range of palaces, more or less connected including the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (ver. 2), "the porch of pillars" (ver. 6), the throne-room or judgment hall (ver. 7), his own house and the house of Pharaoh's daughter (ver. 8). That all these are comprehended under the term "house" is evident from <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1, 10, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>, where Solomon's buildings are always spoken of as <span class="accented">two</span>, viz., "the house of the Lord" and the "king's house." The situation of this string of palaces is by no means certain. Josephus says it stood over against (or opposite) the temple, which is highly probable; but this still leaves the question of site open, for the palace would be justly described as <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, whether it stood west or south of the sanctuary. Ewald places it on the opposite ridge of Ophel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the south prolongation of the temple mount; while Fergusson, Bahr, etc., locate it on the northeast side of Zion, on the opposite side of the Tyropoean valley, and overlooking it and the whole city of David. Recent explorations seem to favour Ewald's view. See "Recovery of Jerusalem," pp. 319 sqq, and "Our Work in Palestine," p. 159 sqq. When we remember that the very site of <span class="accented">Zion</span> is disputed, it will not surprise the reader that questions of this kind should be involved in uncertainty. And when it is further considered that the accumulated <span class="accented">debris</span> of Jerusalem at one point reaches a depth of 120 feet, it will be readily understood what obstacles stand in the way of their settlement.]

It does not follow that this space of 100 x 50 cubits was all roofed in, for it would seem as if the house was built round a courtyard. Rawlinson remarks that a roof of 75 feet is "much greater than is ever found in Assyria." But it is by no means certain that there <span class="accented">was</span> any such roof here], <span class="cmt_word">and the height thereof thirty cubits</span> [the same as the temple], <span class="cmt_word">upon four rows of cedar pillars</span> [How these were disposed of, or what was their number, it is impossible to say. Thenius says they were 400, but this is pure conjecture. The description is so meagre and partial that it is impossible to form a correct idea of the building. The remark made above (ch. 6. Introd. Note) as to the temple applies with still greater force to the palaces. "There are few tasks more difficult or puzzling than the attempt to restore an ancient building of which we possess nothing but two verbal descriptions; and these difficulties are very much enhanced when one account is written in a language like Hebrew, the scientific terms in which are, from our ignorance, capable of the widest latitude of interpretation, and the other, though written in a language of which we have a more definite knowledge, was composed by a person who could never have seen the building he was describing" (Fergusson, Dict. Bib. 2. p. 658)], <span class="cmt_word">with cedar beams</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">cut</span> or hewn beams] upon the pillars. [This palace, according to Fergusson, was "the great hall of state and audience" and the principal building of the range. But if it was this, which is very doubtful, for the throne was in the hall of judgment (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>), it would seem to have served other purposes besides that of an audience-chamber. Among other things, it was certainly an armoury (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>. cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). The Arab. Vers. calls it "the house of his arms." Possibly it was also the residence of the  bodyguard (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-28.htm">1 Kings 14:28</a> with 1 Kings 10:17). Bahr observes that the arrangement of the palaces accords with the Jewish conceptions of the kingly office. The first, the armoury, represents him in his militant character (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), the second in his judicial function (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>), while the third shows him in his private capacity.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>it was</i> covered with cedar above upon the beams, that <i>lay</i> on forty five pillars, fifteen <i>in</i> a row.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was covered</span> [or roofed] <span class="cmt_word">with cedar above</span> [cf. 6:9, 15] <span class="cmt_word">upon the beams</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> lit<span class="accented">., ribs</span>, the word used in <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a> of the <span class="accented">side chambers</span>, and in 1 Kings 6:34 (in the masculine) of the <span class="accented">leaves</span> of the doors], <span class="cmt_word">that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.</span> [Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al</span>. are much exercised <span class="cmt_word">to</span> reconcile this statement with that of ver. 2, which speaks of <span class="accented">four</span> rows, But the explanation is very simple, viz., that the "forty-five, fifteen in a row" does not refer to the pillars but to the side chambers or compartments (A.V., "beams"). The description is so very loose and general that positive statements are out of place, but the meaning certainly appears to be this, that there was a roofing of cedar over the <span class="accented">side chambers</span> (which rested upon the pillars mentioned in ver. 2) <span class="accented">forty-five in</span> number, fifteen in a row. It is true the Masoretic punctuation is against this view. It is also clear that the LXX. understood the numbers forty-five and fifteen to refer to the pillars, for they have essayed to cut the knot by reading <span class="accented">three</span> rows instead of "four rows," in ver. 2. Similarly the Arab. in ver. 3 reads <span class="accented">sixty</span> instead of forty-five; obviously another desperate attempt to solve the difficulty by a corruption of the text. But the solution suggested above is so simple and natural that we can hardly be wrong in adopting it. Bahr says positively that forty-five pillars could not have supported a structure 100 cubits by 50 cubits, "nor could the building have been named ' forest of Lebanon' from forty-five scattered pillars." It would follow hence, that there were side chambers only on three sides of the building, as was the case in the temple. And if (as has been inferred from vers. 4, 5) a three-storied structure is here described; if, that is to say, the forty-five chambers were divided fifteen to a tier or story, it is highly probable that they would be distributed six to each long side and three to the rear (Bahr). This arrangement - a court surrounded by a colonnade and galleries - is still found in the East; as all travellers know. And in its favour it may be said that it is such as to have been suggested by the plan of the temple. The ground plan is the same, with this difference, that a courtyard occupies the place of the temple proper.]

Josephus explains, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">windows in three divisions</span>, but this is no explanation of the words "light against light," etc. Fergusson understands the three outlooks to mean, first, the clerestory windows (that there was a clerestory he infers from Josephus Ant., 7:05.2), who describes this palace as "in the Corinthian manner," which cannot mean, he says, "the Corinthian order, which was not then invented, but after the fashion of a Corinthian <span class="accented">oecus</span>, which was a hall with a clerestory"); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a range of openings under the cornice of the walls; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a range of open doorways. But all this is conjecture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/7-5.htm">1 Kings 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">And all the doors and posts <i>were</i> square, with the windows: and light <i>was</i> against light <i>in</i> three ranks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the doors and posts</span> [For <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> posts, Thenius would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">outlooks</span>, after ver. 4, which seems a natural emendation, especially as the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. We should then get the sense of "doors and windows "] were square of beam. [The word translated "windows" in ver. 4; the proper rendering is <span class="accented">beam</span>, and the meaning apparently is that all these openings were square in shape. Nothing is said about the height of the rooms, and as the commentators are not agreed whether there was one story or three, that can obviously be only matter of conjecture. Rawlinson, who thinks of but one hall, with three rows of windows, supposes, after Houbigant, that one row was placed in a wall which ran down the middle of the apartment. Such an arrangement, he observes, was found by Layard at Nimrud.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch <i>was</i> before them: and the <i>other</i> pillars and the thick beam <i>were</i> before them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made a porch of pillars</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the porch of pillars.</span> This was no doubt a covered colonnade, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it had a roof but no sides. The pillars were its only walls. But here the question presents itself, Was this porch the vestibule of the house of the forest of Lebanon, just described? From the correspondence between its width and that of this palace, Rawlinson infers that it was (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2, 3</a>). Bahr believes it to have been the porch or entrance to the hall of judgment mentioned in the next verse,  while Fergusson again assigns it an independent position, separate from either. The <span class="accented">term porch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), the meaning of which is surely determined by its use in ch. 6, almost implies that it must have served as the entrance or vestibule to some building. But the size, and the fact that it had itself a porch (see below), favour the idea that it was an independent structure, though Rawlinson shows that "most of the Persepolitan porches had small pillared chambers at some little distance in front of them," and refers to the Egyptian <span class="accented">propylaea</span>. Keil argues that this <span class="accented">pillar hall</span>, as he calls it, stood between the house of the forest of Lebanon and the judgment hall. Bahr, as remarked above, sees in it the anterior part of the judgment hall, which latter, he adds, bore to it the same relation that the oracle did to the temple house. He observes that as the ark was in the oracle, so the throne (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>) found a place in the hall of judgment. This structure, therefore, with its porch, mentioned presently, would reproduce the main features of the temple arrangement. We see, consequently, that both the house of the forest of Lebanon and the porch of pillars followed in their outline the ground plan of the temple. Nor is this at all surprising, considering that all these edifices probably had the same architect or designer]; <span class="cmt_word">the length thereof was fifty cubits</span> [the length, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the view last advanced of the two divisions of the building, viz., the porch of pillars and the porch of judgment. But the correspondence of the length (or width - the same word is used of the width of the <span class="accented">temple</span> porch <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>) of this porch with the width of the house of the forest of Lebanon is, to say the least, remarkable, and suggests that after all it may have been the porch of that building. If so, the resemblance to the temple would be still more striking], <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth</span> [depth?] <span class="cmt_word">thereof thirty cubits: and</span> <span class="cmt_word">the porch</span> [Heb. a porch] <span class="cmt_word">was before them</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the pillars.

He then refers to the "gate of justice" at Granada and the "Sublime <span class="accented">Porte</span> "at Constantinople. It is, perhaps, not quite so certain that "this porch was the gem and centre of the whole empire," or that because it was so much thought of a similar but smaller porch was erected for the queen (ver. 8) ("Jewish Ch.," 2. p. 195)]: <span class="cmt_word">and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</span> [Heb. from <span class="accented">the floor to the floor</span>, as marg.

Keil thinks the ceiling served as the floor of an upper story, built over the porch of judgment, but, as Bahr observes, no such upper story is even hinted at elsewhere. It seems to me that, on the whole, the A.V. rendering is to be retained, the meaning being that the whole space, both of wall and cieling, from one side of the floor to the opposite side, was covered with cedar.]

If, however, it is preferred to see in the "daughters of Dan" a tribal reference, we may suppose (with Keil, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that the woman was originally a Danite, but became, through her first husband, "of the tribe of Naphtali."

In later times the word sometimes denoted brass (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), or copper-bronze Ca mixture of copper and tin). Cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>. From <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a> we learn that Hiram was "skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber," etc. From the mention of brass only in this passage, and in ver. 45, it has been somewhat hastily concluded that "the work that he personally did for Solomon" was "limited to works in brass" (Rawlinson). It is, perhaps, safer to say that brass only is mentioned here, because the following section treats exclusively of the brazen ornaments, etc., of the sanctuary (Keil). It would almost seem, however (see note on ver. 48), as if he was not employed to make the vessels of gold. Nor does this supposition really contradict the statement made below, viz., that he wrought all Solomon's work]: <span class="cmt_word">and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning</span> [or <span class="accented">knowledge</span>, as the same word is rendered <a href="../../par/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>, where similar language is used of Bezaleel.

To this must be added the capital (vers. 16, 19), which measured five (or, according to some, nine) cubits, and probably the pedestal. The pillars were hollow, the metal being four finger breadths thick (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a> the height is given as thirty-five cubits - a discrepancy which has been variously explained. According to some writers (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Abravanel, Movers, Wordsworth), this represents the total length of the <span class="accented">two</span> pillars (each pillar consequently being 17.5 cubits) - an idea which, perhaps, finds some slight support in the word employed <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> <span class="accented">length.</span> Here it <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5d2;&#x5da;&#x5da;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> By others it has been supposed that the total height of base, column, and capital was thirty-five cubits, which, if not incredible, is very improbable. Others think it a part of that systematic reduplication of the heights of edifices by the chronicler, of which we have already had an instance in ch. 6. (where see note). But the true explanation would seem to be that, by a clerical error, thirty-five (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>) has been substituted in the text for eighteen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;</span>).

[It must not be supposed, from the fact that the height of the one column is given, and the circumference of the other, that they were dissimilar in height and breadth or girth. There has probably been an accidental abbreviation of the full expression, "Eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar, and eighteen cubits was the height of the other pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits compassed the other pillar." It is just possible, however, that the peculiarity results from the actual system of  measurement employed in this case. As they were castings, it would be needless to measure both pillars, and so the length may have been ascertained from the first, and the breadth from the second. The columns would thus be about twenty-seven feet high, and about six feet in diameter.]

See note on ver. 19. But it is not a fatal objection to the latter view that it would make the entire chapiter, or both members, nine cubits high; no less, that is, than one-half the length of the shaft. No doubt to modern ideas this appears wholly disproportionate; but a double chapiter, bearing the same proportion to the shaft, is found in some of the buildings of Persepolis (Fergusson,. Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457). From the expression of vers. 41, 42, "the bowls of the chapiters" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>), and the word "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) in ver. 20, we gather that the chapiters were bowl shaped, or bellied out something like the so called "cushion capital" in Norman architecture.

And were they architectural or monumental? Did they support the roof of the porch, or were they isolated and detached, after the manner of obelisks? I incline to the opinion of Bahr, that they stood <span class="accented">in</span> the porch, but that they formed no part of the building, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that they were not for any structural use, but simply for ornament. This appears to me, on the whole, to result from the following considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The language used favours a position within the porch. We have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (  =  "<span class="accented">at</span> or <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">the</span> porch," perhaps for the porch, as Bahr), and in ver. 19 (where see note) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. And with this agree the expression of the Chronicles "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the house," and "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the temple" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15, 17</a>). The pillars would, however, be "before the temple," whether they stood within or in front of the porch, and it may be safely allowed that the language of the historian is not <span class="accented">decisive</span> one way or the other. The prepositions of the text, however, seem to lend some support to Bahr's view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We know that the Phoenicians used <span class="accented">isolated</span> metal columns as sacred ornaments, so that Hiram would be familiar with such a mode of ornamentation" (Rawlinson). "Whenever in coins or histories we get a  representation of a Phoenician temple, it always has a pillar or pillars standing within or before it" (Stanley). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is extremely doubtful whether these columns, twenty-three feet in height, were adapted to serve as supports to the roof of the porch. The height of the latter has been variously estimated at twenty, thirty, and sixty cubits, and whichever estimate is preferred, the columns would appear to be of an unsuitable altitude. Fergusson says they <span class="accented">were</span> "appropriate to support the roof of the porch," but then he conceives the columns to be in all twenty-seven cubits high (see on ver. 19), and allows the remaining three cubits for the slope of the roof). But, as we cannot be certain either of the height of the porch or of the column, this is an argument of which very little can be made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> If the pillars were part of the building, they would almost certainly have been of the same material, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, wood or stone. Their metallic composition is certainly an argument for their monumental character. It can hardly be alleged in favour of this view, however, that they are mentioned amongst the vessels or articles of furniture, for the historian might fittingly describe the pillars here, as being the principal of the "works in brass" which Hiram wrought, even if they did form the supports of the roof of the porch. Nor are we justified, considering the extreme brevity and the partial character of the description of the temple, in affirming that they would have been mentioned in connexion with the building, had they formed part of the edifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The remark of Stieglitz (cited by Bahr) that "it was their separate position alone which gave these pillars the impressive aspect they were designed to wear," lends some little support to this view. So also does <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The fact that these columns and these alone, received special names. "No architectural portion of the building received a name" (Keil). But this argument, again, is not too unduly pressed, for to some it may seem that the names they bore would have a special propriety and an enhanced significance, if the columns contributed to the <span class="accented">strength and stability</span> of the edifice. The question, therefore, is one of considerable complexity, the more so, as it is maintained that it would be almost impossible to construct a roof thirty feet in width without some such pillars to support the beam (Fergusson); but the balance of evidence appears to favour the view that Jachin and Boaz were monuments erected in the porch, to dignify the sanctuary, and to symbolize the power and eternity of the Being to whom it was dedicated]: <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin</span> [<span class="accented">i.e., he shall establish</span>, as marg. The name expressed the belief that God would preserve and protect the new lane. It is true that a Jachin is mentioned (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-17.htm">1 Chronicles 24:17</a>), as head of the 21st course of priests in the reign of David, while a Boaz was one of Solomon's ancestors, but the columns could hardly be named after them, or an private persons. Ewald suggests that they were named after "some favourites of the time, perhaps young sons of Solon on." The idea of Thenius that these names were engraved upon the pillars is not wholly improbable, though of course it finds no support in the text] <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the left pillar</span> [the left as one faced them from the house. The right hand is identified with the south in ver. 39], <span class="cmt_word">and called the name thereof Boaz.</span> [Marg. <span class="accented">in it is strength.</span> Probably "<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">Him, i.e.</span>, God, is its strength" (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>). The thought of Jachin, "<span class="accented">He</span> will establish," is thus continued; and the two pillars pointed alike to the God of Israel as the true support and upholder of His sanctuary. The LXX. interpretation of these two names, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>), <span class="accented">success</span> and <span class="accented">strength</span>, though very far from literal, preserves their fundamental ideas.

The common explanation of the discrepancy, viz., that it held 2000 baths "when filled to its ordinary height, but when filled to the brim 3000" (Wordsworth), appears to me hardly ingenuous] baths. ["The data for determining the value of the bath or ephah are both scanty and conflicting" (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1741). Josephus, the only authority on the subject, says that it equalled the Attic <span class="accented">metretes</span> (about 8.5 gals.), but it is very doubtful whether he was "really familiar with the Greek measures" (<span class="accented">ib.</span>) At any rate, if this statement is correct, his other statement as to the shape of the laver must be altogether erroneous, since 2000 baths would equal 17,000 gals., and a hemispherical laver could not possibly have contained more than 10,000. The attempt has been made, on the assumption that the sea was a hemisphere, as Josephus affirms, to calculate from its capacity the value of the bath, which in that case would be about four gallons. But there is good reason for doubting whether the laver was hemispherical - such a shape would be ill adapted to its position on the backs of oxen - and some have maintained that <span class="cmt_word">it</span> was cylindrical, others that, like the laver of the tabernacle, it had a foot (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>) or basin. The prevailing opinion of scholars, however, appears to be that it was 30 cubits in circumference only at the lip, and that it bellied out considerably below. While the shape, however, must remain a matter of uncertainty, we are left in no doubt as to its purpose. It was "for the priests to wash in" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>) - not, of course, for immersing their whole persons, but their hands and feet (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19, 21</a>). The priests (after <a href="../../par/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>, etc.) ministered barefoot. It was, according to Rabbinical tradition, provided with taps or faucets (Bahr). It has, however, been held by some that the water issued forth (as in the Alhambra) from the lions' mouths. It is probable that a basin of some sort was attached to it. Whether the laver was filled by the hand or by some special contrivance, it is quite impossible to say. We know that provision was made for storing water hard by. The present writer was privileged in 1861 to explore the great reservoir, the <span class="accented">Bahr el Khebir</span>, still existing underneath the Haram area, at a time when very few Europeans had seen it (see Pal.

As Zarthan was almost certainly west of the Jordan, and as the casting - from the nature of the country - must as certainly have been done to the west of the river it is somewhat surprising to find a trans-Jordanie town mentioned as one of the landmarks defining the site. It is possible that there was a western Succoth - a place named <span class="accented">Sakut</span> was discovered by Robinson and Van de velde, a few miles south of Bethshean; but this name is radically different (Conder).
