The name possibly indicates Solomon's ambitious hopes respecting him. The irony of history alone emphasizes it. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18, 19</a> would seem to show that Solomon himself had misgivings as to his son's abilities. "As the greatest persons cannot give themselves children, so the wisest cannot give their children wisdom" (Hall). His mother was Naamah, an Ammonitess (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>). It would appear from <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>, that he was 41 years of age at his accession.

To these reasons Rawlinson adds a fifth, viz. "that it is hardly likely that David would have permitted his son to marry an Ammonitess, which of course he must have done, if Rehoboam was born in his lifetime. But it should be remembered that David had himself married a foreign princess, Maachah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-2.htm">1 Chronicles 3:2</a>). There is greater force in the remark that Solomon's marriages with Ammonite and Moabite women belong apparently to a later period of his life (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>). Altogether the evidence seems to point to a corruption of the text of <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>, etc., and it has been suggested that "forty-one" is there an error of transcription for "twenty-one," a mistake easily made, if, as is extremely probable, the ancient Hebrews, like the later, used the letters of the alphabet as numerals. Twenty-one would then be <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span>; forty-one <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">went to</span> [This journey was probably made soon after a prior coronation at Jerusalem. According to the LXX. addition, it was at least a year after his accession] <span class="cmt_word">Shechem</span> [An old gathering place of the northern tribes (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>). Its position, in the very centre of Palestine, fitted it for this purpose. ("Shechem may be considered the natural capital of Palestine," Conder, p. 16.) But it was perhaps primarily selected because it was the capital of Ephraim, not because it was a "national sanctuary of Israel" (Wordsworth), a title to which it has but little claim. It had once before furnished Ephraim with a king (<a href="../../par/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>). We learn from <a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a> that it was "in Mount Ephraim;" from <a href="../../par/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a> that it was under Mount Gerizim. To its position the place was, no doubt, indebted for its name. It is often said to be doubtful whether the place was named after Shechem, the son of Hamor (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>), or whether this prince took his name from the place. The latter is, no doubt, the correct view. For <span class="accented">Shechem</span> means strictly, not, as it is often translated, the "shoulder," but <span class="accented">dorsi pars superior</span>, or perhaps the space between the shoulder blades (as is proved by <a href="../../par/job/31-22.htm">Job 31:22</a>, "Let my shoulder fall," <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). Hence the word is found only in the singular (see Gesen., Thessalonians 3. p. 1407). Now any one who has seen the vale of Shechem (Nablus) will hardly doubt that its name is due to its resemblance to this part of the body (compare "Ezion-geber," <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>). The town lies in a valley between the two ridges of Ebal and Gerizim; cf. Jos., Ant. 4:08. 44. "The feet of these mountains where they rise from the town [to the height of 1000 feet] are not more than 500 yards apart." It is consequently one of the most striking and beautiful spots in Palestine, and the more so as its perennial supply of water clothes it with perpetual verdure. For its history see <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4-12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-20.htm">Joshua 21:20</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>; etc. In the New Testament it has been supposed to appear under the form <span class="accented">Sychar</span> (<a href="../../par/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>), and this variation has been universally accounted for as a <span class="accented">paronomasia</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> meaning "a lie." But the recent survey has given us good reasons for identifying the place last named with 'Askar, a little village on the slope of Ebal, half a mile from Jacob's well and a little over a mile from Nablus (Condor, pp. 40, 41) ]: for [This word suggests that Rehoboam  had not "<span class="accented">selected</span> the capital of Ephraim to be the scene" of his coronation (Rawl.) but that he went thither <span class="accented">because</span> the northern tribes claimed this concession. They demanded apparently that he should meet them to receive their homage in the territory of Ephraim. It was a recognition of the importance of the tribe, and there they could the better urge their demands] <span class="cmt_word">all Israel</span> [That is, not the twelve tribes (Ewald), but the ten, or their representatives. The name of Israel was already identified with the ten, or rather eleven, tribes (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9, 10, 17, 28</a>). It is highly probable that the comparative isolation of Judah from the rest of the tribes (see Dict. Bib. vol. 1. p. 1157) had led to this result. Indeed, this fact - that the term "Israel" was used of the whole nation, <span class="accented">exclusive</span> of the tribe of Judah - shows in a very significant way the alienation of Judah from the rest] <span class="cmt_word">were come to Shoehorn to make him king</span>. [It would certainly seem from these words as if the ten tribes had then no settled idea of revolting. Kimchi sees in the very selection of Shechem a proof that they were only "seeking an opportunity for transferring the government to Jeroboam." Similarly Keil. But the glories of Solomon's reign and the traditions of the house of David would surely make <span class="accented">them</span> hesitate, even if they had heard of the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29</a>), before they wantonly broke away from Rehoboam. And the text says expressly that they had assembled to "make him king," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to accept him as such, to anoint him (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a> compared with <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a> shows that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> is synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, Keil), after the example of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15</a>), David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>), and Solomon (ch. 1:39; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). No doubt, as the context shows, they intended to stipulate for an alleviation of burdens, etc., and their selection of Shechem as the place where they would render their allegiance was a "significant hint" (Ewald. "The very place puts Israel in mind of a rebellion," Bp. Hall) to Rehoboam. Their putting forward Jeroboam as their spokesman -presuming for the present that the received text of ver. 3 is to be retained, as to which, however, see below - was a further hint, or rather a plain indication, that they did not mean to be trifled with. It is not a proof, however, as Keil maintains, that they had already determined to make the latter king, for they distinctly said to Rehoboam (ver. 4), "Grant our petition <span class="accented">and we will serve thee</span>." (Ewald, who says "they had the fullest intentions of confirming his power as king if their wishes were granted," points out how this fact makes against the received text, according to which they had already summoned Jeroboam from Egypt.) It is clear from this and the passages cited above that the Jewish people at this period of their history were accustomed, not indeed to choose their king, but to confirm him in his office by public acclamation.]

It is true it involves but a slight change, and it may simplify the construction. But no change is really required, Bahr's objection, that in the text, as it stands, we have an unmeaning repetition, "He was still in Egypt...  and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt," loses all its force if we understand Jeroboam to have continued his residence in Egypt (as the LXX. says he did) after hearing of Solomon's death. until summoned by the tribes to be their leader. In any case the repetition accords with Hebrew usage.]

Vat. has simply,  "<span class="accented">And the people</span> spake unto king Rehoboam, saying." Of more importance, however, is the fact that it is at direct variance with ver. 20, which places the appearance of Jeroboam on the scene <span class="accented">after</span> the revolt of the tribes. Indeed, these two verses can only be brought into agreement by the questionable device of understanding the "all Israel" of ver. 20 very differently from the same expression in ver. 1. If, however, we follow in this instance the LXX., which omits the name of Jeroboam both here and in ver. 12 (and which thereby implies that he was not one of the deputation to Rehoboam, but, as ver. 2 states, was at that time still in Egypt), the difficulty vanishes. Ver. 20 then becomes the natural and logical continuation of vers. 2, 3. "And Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt. And they sent and called him [to the country.]...  And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again [at their summons] they sent and called him unto the congregation," etc. And in favour of the omission of Jeroboam's name is the fact that the Hebrew text, both in ver. 3 and in ver. 12, betrays some little confusion.

It is one which occasions us some surprise, as the reign of Solomon had not only been glorious, but the people had apparently enjoyed the greatest plenty and prosperity (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20, 25</a>; cf. 8:66). Bishop Hall, Bahr, and other writers, consequently, who see in the fact that the ten tribes had chosen Jeroboam for their mouthpiece a settled determination on their part to revolt, affirm that their grievances were purely factitious. But we must not forget that, despite the unbroken peace (see Hall, "Contempl." 2:136) and general prosperity and affluence, the people had had one burden at least to bear which is always galling and vexatious, the burden of a conscription. It is by no means certain, though it is constantly assumed, and is not in itself improbable, that the taxes and imposts had been heavy, the passages alleged in support of that view (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>, LXX.) being quite inconclusive. But while we have no right to speak of the, enormous exactions of the late king" (Stanley), we may be perfectly sure that such an establishment as his (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 26</a>) and such undertakings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26, 17, 18</a>) would be extremely costly, and that their cost was not altogether defrayed by the presents of subject princes (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; cf. 10:10, 14), the profits of the king's merchants (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>), or the imports of the fleet (1 Kings 5:21 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:7<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>). But the people had certainly had to pay a more odious tribute, that of forced labour, of servile work (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>, Hebr.; 5:14 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 4:34<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> is almost always used of a tribute rendered by labour, Gesen.) It is quite true that Solomon was not the first to institute this; that David had exacted it before him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>); that the burden was one with which all subjects of the old-world monarchies, especially in the East, were familiar; and that in this case it had been imposed with peculiar considerateness (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>). But it is none the less certain, when we consider the magnitude of Solomon's undertakings, and the number of men necessarily employed in executing them, that it must have involved some hardships and created much dissatisfaction; such results are inevitable in all conscriptions. "Forced labour has been amongst the causes leading to insurrection in many ages and countries. It alienated the people of Rome from the last Tarquin; it helped to bring about the French Revolution; and it was for many years one of the principal grievances of the Russian serfs" (Rawlinson). But we may find instances of its working perhaps as more Eastern, more closely illustrative of the text amongst the Fellahin of Egypt. "According to Pliny, 360,000 men had to work 20 years long at one pyramid" (Bahr). In the construction of the great Mahmoudieh canal, by Mehemet All, over 300,000 labourers were employed. They worked under the lash, and such were the fatigues and hardships of their life that many thousands died in the space of a few months (cf., too, <a href="../../par/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a> sqq.; Exodus 2:23]: <span class="cmt_word">now therefore make thou the grievous</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">hard, heavy</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">lighten somewhat from</span>," etc.], <span class="cmt_word">and we will serve thee.</span> [Their stipulations seem reasonable enough. Bahr, who says, "We cannot admit the complaint of too hard tribute work to be well founded," and Keil, who maintains that "there cannot have been any well-grounded occasion for complaint," surely forget that both the aged counsellors (ver. 7) and also the writer of this book (vers. 13-15) manifest some degree of sympathy with the complainants.]

That there was a relationship, and that the office had descended from father to son, can hardly be doubted, but whether two persons or three are indicated it is impossible to say. It is of course just possible, though hardly likely that one and the same person (Ewald) can  have been superintendent of servile work under David, Solomon, and Rehoboam. It is generally assumed that the young king sent this officer "to treat with the rebels and to appease them, as Josephus expressly says" (Bahr). It seems quite as likely that he was sent to coerce them, or to collect the taxes, as a summary way of showing that the king meant to enforce his rights and was not moved by their words. For it is hardly probable that such a proud and headstrong prince as Rehoboam would stoop, especially after the confident threats which he had just uttered, to parley with rebels. Such a man, guided by such counsellors, and inflated with a sense of his own power and importance, would naturally think of force rather than of conciliation or concessions. He would be for trying his whips of scorpions. And if conciliation had been his object, it is hardly likely that he would have employed Adoram, the superintendent of the levy, a man who would naturally be obnoxious to the people, to effect it.

Bahr, Keil, and others, who start from the assumption that secession was determined upon even before Rehoboam came to Shechem, and that the complaints of the people respecting the grievous service to which they had been subjected by Solomon were groundless, naturally conclude that it was altogether treasonable and unjustifiable. But is this conclusion borne out by the facts? We may readily admit that the schism was not accomplished without sin: we cannot but allow that Israel acted with undue precipitation, and that Rehoboam, who was "young and tenderhearted," was entitled, for David's and Solomon's sake, as well as his own, to greater forbearance and consideration, and it is almost certain that both the "envy of Ephraim" and the ambition of Jeroboam largely influenced the result. At the same time, it is to be remembered that the division of the kingdom was ordained of God, and that the people had just cause of complaint, if not, indeed, sufficient warrant for resistance, in the arbitrary and insolent rejection of their petition by the young king. No law of God requires men to yield themselves up without a struggle to such cruel and abject slavery as Rehoboam threatened these men with. They judged - and who shall say unreasonably? - from his words that they had only tyranny and cruelty to expect at his hands, and what wonder if they stood on their defence?

That a sort of jealousy existed at one time between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, consequent, no doubt, on the transference of the sceptre from the house of Saul to that of David, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> very evident. A thousand men of Benjamin constituted the following of the rebel Shimei, (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). The rising of Sheba the Benjamite, again (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), proves that the enmity and discontent were not even then subdued. But when the ten tribes fell away, Benjamin seems never to have faltered in its allegiance. The change is easily accounted for. It was the glory of Benjamin that Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, the civil and religious capital of the nation, was largely within its border. "The city of the Jebusite" was in the lot of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). But it was also on the boundary line of Judah. This fact had, no doubt, brought the two tribes into close contact, and had given them interests in common, in fact had "riveted them together as by a cramp" (Blunt, pp. 167, 174, who traces "a gradual tendency of the ten tribes to become confederate under Ephraim," and a growing alliance and community of interests between Judah and Benjamin); and now Benjamin could not fail to see that separation from Judah would mean the loss of Jerusalem (which would be largely peopled by the men of Judah, David's tribe, and would be practically in their hands), while adhesion to Ephraim would not prevent the establishment of another sanctuary further north. The traditions of fifty years, consequently, and the common interest in the capital, prevailed over hereditary ties and ancient feuds, and decided Benjamin to cast in its lot with Judah;the more so, as the heads of this tribe may have felt, after once furnishing Israel with its king, as jealous of Ephraim as they had once been of Judah.

LXX. inserts along addition, which differs from, and indeed contradicts, the Hebrew text in some important particulars. Rehoboam is represented as 16 years of age (Hebrews 40), as reigning 12 years (Hebrews 17); his mother is Naanan (Heb. Naamah), and is the daughter of Ana, son of Nahash, king of Ammon. Jeroboam is described as son of Sarira, a harlot. He is appointed by Solomon superintendent of the levy of Ephraim, and builds for him a city Sarira, and also completes the circumvallation of Jerusalem. He has 300 chariots and aims at royalty. Solomon seeking to slay him, he flees to Shishak, king of Egypt, who treats him with distinction, giving him the sister of his own wife in marriage. Here his son Abijah is born, when Rehoboam has been, something like a year upon the throne. After his birth, Jeroboam asks a second time to be released: he returns to his own country, takes up his abode at Sarira, fortifies it, and gathers the tribe of Ephraim round him. Here Abijah falls sick, and the visit to the prophet, narrated in chap. 14, takes place. The child dies; there is general mourning, after which Jeroboam goes to Shechem, and collects the tribes. Here the prophet Shemaiah (not Ahijah) tears a new garment in twelve pieces, gives him ten, and promises him the dominion over ten tribes. After which follow the events of vers. 5-24 of this chapter. The great circumstantiality of this narrative has led some scholars - Dean Stanley among them - to prefer it before the Hebrew version. But its details will not bear careful examination, and there is little doubt that it is a compilation of later date. Its untrustworthiness has been well shown among others by Rawlinson, Speaker's Commentary <span class="accented">in loc</span>. But he omits to notice what is perhaps its strongest condemnation, viz., that this LXX. addition is in conflict with the LXX. (and Hebrews) text of chap. 11. The account of Jeroboam's marriage with the sister of the queen, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., is manifestly a variation of the history of Hadad (ch. 11. ver. 19; see also ver. 22).

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL, AND THE SCHISM IN THE CHURCH. - The historian, after describing the great rebellion of the Jewish people, proceeds, in the rest of this chapter, to relate the measures which the new king took to secure his position. These were both external and internal. The external means were the erection of fortresses; the internal, the provision of new sanctuaries, priests, and ordinances.

"The tower of Sichem had been burnt down by Abimelech and the tower of Penuel had been destroyed by Gideon, <a href="../../par/judges/8-17.htm">Judges 8:17</a>" (Keil). The <span class="accented">city</span> of Shechem had been destroyed at the same time as the tower, but had no doubt been rebuilt, at least in part, otherwise it could hardly have been selected for Rehoboam's coronation. It was naturally Jeroboam's first care to strengthen his position by fortitying his capital, and the more so as this city would be particularly obnoxious to Rehoboam as the scene of the revolution; but why he should at the same time have rebuilt Penuel - Ewald thinks the seat of government was placed here - is not at first eight so obvious, as it lay beyond the Jordan (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>) and was therefore presumably outside the circle of hostilities, should such arise. Probably it was because this was the gate to his Trans-Jordanic territory. A tower commanding the fords of the Jordan would secure Reuben, Gad, etc., against invasion from Judah. It is also not unlikely that Jeroboam. who was the great castle builder of that age, had some fears of "hostile attacks from the north and northeast" (Keil), or thought of "the caravan road which led over Gilead to Damascus" (Wordsworth), and of which he would wish, for the sake of his revenue, to retain the control], <span class="cmt_word">and dwelt therein</span> [He made it his first residence and capital]; <span class="cmt_word">and went out from thence</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, when he had secured one fortified city.

But is this quite so certain? The people after the revolt would naturally conclude that Rehoboam, of whose proud temper they had had such proof, would want to wreak his vengeance on the city which had rejected him, and the instinct of self-defence would lead them at once to rebuild their walls. And the newborn kingdom would also earnestly desire to possess a suitable capital. Thus their self-interest and enthusiasm alike would obviate the necessity for a conscription.]

Bahr understands, "he reflected about it alone" (<span class="accented">et excogitato consilio</span>, Vulgate), alleging that so important a circumstance as the concurrence of the heads of the people in changing the system of worship would not have been passed over in silence. But while the text does not perhaps imply any formal deliberation with the elders, it is reasonable to suppose that Jeroboam, who owed his position to popular election, and who was far too sagacious not to follow the example of Rehoboam (vers. 6, 9), would summon others to advise him as to this critical and momentous step. Wordsworth refers to <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>, and says that "Jeroboam is the image and pattern of Machiavellian politicians." "Next to Ahithophel, I do not find that Israel yielded a craftier head than Jeroboam's" (Hall)], <span class="cmt_word">and made two calves</span> [It is generally held that these were in imitation of, or were suggested by, the "golden calf" of Aaron (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>), and the close resemblance of Jeroboam's words (below), in inaugurating this new <span class="accented">cultus</span>, to Aaron's have been thought to prove it. But surely it has been overlooked that Jeroboam could hardly be so shortsighted and unwise as deliberately to reintroduce a worship which had provoked the "fierce wrath" (ver. 12) of God, and had nearly resulted in the extermination of the Jewish race. For of course neither Jeroboam nor his people could have forgotten the stern condemnation which Aaron's calf worship had received. The molten image ground to powder, the ashes mixed in the drink of the people, the slaughter of three thousand worshippers, etc., would assuredly have lived in the memories of the nation. A more impolitic step, consequently - one more certain to precipitate his ruin, by driving the whole nation into the arms of Judah - Jeroboam could not have taken, than to attempt any revival or imitation of the forbidden cultus of the desert. And it is as little likely that the worship of the calves was derived from the worship of Apis, as practised at Memphis, or of "Mnevis, the sacred calf of Heliopolis" (Stanley), though with both of these Jeroboam had recently been in contact. It would have been but a sorry recommendation in the eyes of Israel that the first act of the new king should be to introduce the hateful idolatry of Egypt into the land; and every consideration tends to show that the calf worship was not, and was not intended to be, idolatry, such as the worship of Egypt undoubtedly was. It is always carefully distinguished from idol worship by the historians and prophets. And the idea which Jeroboam wished to give his subjects was clearly this that, so far from introducing new gods or new sanctuaries, he was merely accommodating the old worship to the new state of things. He evidently felt that what he and his house had most to fear was, not the armies of Rehoboam but the ritual and religious associations of Jerusalem. His object, if he were wise, must therefore be to provide a substitute, a counterfeit worship. "I will give you," he virtually says, "at Bethel and Dan, old sanctuaries of our race long before Jerusalem usurped their place, those visible emblems of the heavenly powers such as are now found only in the temple. You too shall possess those mysterious forms which symbolize the Invisible, but you shall have them nearer home and easier of access." There can be little doubt, consequently, that the "calves" were imitations of the colossal cherubim of Solomon's temple, in which the ox or calf was probably the <span class="accented">forma praecipua</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23</a>).] <span class="cmt_word">of gold</span> [Hardly of solid gold.

"<span class="accented">This</span> is thy god," etc. The words are not "<span class="accented">exactly</span> the same as the people used when setting up the golden calf" (Bahr).

But a little reflection will show that it is much more difficult to believe that a monarch, circumstanced as Jeroboam was, could at the very outset of his career have acted in the teeth of history, and have committed the gross blunder, not to say wanton outrage, of deliberately connecting his new cult with the calf worship of the desert. He can hardly have dared, that is, to say, "This is no new religion, for this very form of worship our fathers used formerly in the desert, under the guidance of Aaron himself" (Seb. Schmidt, followed by Keil, <span class="accented">al</span>.) unless both he and his people alike - which is inconceivable - were ignorant of their nation's history recorded in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19-35</a>. It has been argued by some that this action of Jeroboam and the ready compliance of the ten tribes, prove that the Pentateuch cannot then have been written. But, as Hengstenberg (cited by Wordsworth) rejoins, the same argument would lead to the conclusion that the Bible could not have been written in the dark ages, or, we might add, even at the present day. He can hardly have claimed, that is to say, to be reintroducing the calf worship, which God had so emphatically reprobated, unless he designed an open defiance of the Most High, and wished to shock all the religious instincts and convictions of his people. It is much more natural, consequently, to suppose, considering the very frequent recurrence, though sometimes in slightly different shapes, of the formula "the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt" (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45, 46</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-38.htm">Leviticus 25:38</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-41.htm">Numbers 15:41</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-13.htm">Numbers 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-6.htm">Joshua 24:6, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-8.htm">Judges 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-8.htm">1 Samuel 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-18.htm">1 Samuel 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-21.htm">1 Kings 8:21</a>, etc.) that the correspondence is accidental, the more so as Jeroboam does not quote the exact words, and that he has used a phrase which was constantly in their ears, insisting thereby that his calves were emblems of the God of their race, the God whose great glory it was that He had taken their nation out of the midst of another nation, etc. (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>), and delivered them from a thraldom with which, perhaps, the tyranny of Rehoboam is indirectly compared.

First, both these places were in some sort sanctuaries already. Bethel was already a <span class="accented">makom</span>, or holy place, in the days of Abraham; was consecrated by the visions and altar of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11-19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1, 7, 15</a>), and by the ark having been there (<a href="../../par/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26-28</a>, Hebrews; cf. Jos., Ant., 5:02.10). And though Dan (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>) can hardly have had as sacred a character as the "house of God and the gate of heaven" (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>) had, still it had its shrine and its schismatic priesthood. A grandson of Moses (<a href="../../par/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13</a>, true reading) had ministered there, and his sons were the priests of Dan still. Secondly, these localities would suit the convenience of his subjects, being respectively at the southern and northern extremities of the kingdom. And this, no doubt, was one reason why Dan was chosen in preference to other places, such as Shiloh, which, though more sacred,  were less conveniently situated. A sanctuary at Dan would save the northern tribes many tedious journeys. It should be remarked that Bethel properly belonged to Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13, 22</a>), though it was also on the border of Ephraim; and it has been suggested that it was Jeroboam's selection of this place as a seat of the calf worship decided the tribe of Benjamin to follow the lead of Judah. But the narrative seems to imply that their choice had been made at an earlier period (ver. 21), and the city would seem to have been long in the possession of the house of Joseph (<a href="../../par/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22</a>). It is now known as <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, and is one of the most naked and dreary spots in Palestine. "The place seems, as it were, turned to stone; and we can well imagine that the patriarch found nothing softer than a stone for his pillow." Conder, p. 252, who suggests that from the time of Abraham Bethel was a <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, a sacred place merely (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>), and distinct from the adjoining <span class="accented">city</span> of Luz (ver. 19).] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-30.htm">1 Kings 12:30</a></div><div class="verse">And this thing became a sin: for the people went <i>to worship</i> before the one, <i>even</i> unto Dan.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this thing became a sin</span> [It <span class="accented">was</span> in itself sinful, for it both set at nought the express prohibition of the Decalogue (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>), and also disregarded the one sanctuary of God's choice (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>). And it led to other sins, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, the intrusion of a schismatic and irregular priesthood, and the performance of unauthorized rites, and to "an ever-deepening corruption of the national faith" (Ewald). Cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>. But the meaning is, it became an occasion of sin to the people ("<span class="accented">Quod fuit postea causa gravissimi peccati" -</span> Vatab.)

Some (Rawlinson, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>.) have suggested that the text is here corrupt, and that we should read, "before the one to Bethel, and before the other to Dan." According to others, "the one" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) refers to the double <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> ("the one," "the other"); cf. ver. 29. They would interpret, that is, "the people went to both, even to the distant Dan" (Bahr, Thenius). Keil would force the text and understand, "the people, even unto Dan," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the people throughout the whole kingdom. Similarly, Wordsworth. Ewald understands "before the one" to mean <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "<span class="accented">as one</span>," <span class="accented">sc</span>. man. On the whole it is better to take the words as they stand, literally. It is quite conceivable that, at first, the people resorted almost exclusively to the Danite sanctuary. Having been for long years a seat of worship, and having probably its "house of high places," or temple (see below), already built, it would naturally be in a position to receive worshippers some time before Bethel was prepared for that purpose. Jeroboam's offering in person at Bethel (ver. 32) which marks the inauguration of his new ritual there, may have been partly designed to attract worshippers to a shrine, which, as being nearer Jerusalem, or for some other reason, was neglected. But the verse is patient of another interpretation. It may intend to convey that the rebellious tribes, in their defiant disregard of the old order of things, the order now represented by a hostile kingdom, went <span class="accented">en masse</span> to the opposite point of the compass, even to the unhallowed and hitherto despised sanctuary of the Danites. The LXX. (Vat.) addition here is noticeable, "And they forsook the house of the Lord."] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a></div><div class="verse">And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made an house of high places</span> [See on 1 Kings 3:2, and cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. It is often assumed (Keil, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al.</span> after Josephus) that Jeroboam built <span class="accented">two</span> temples for his cherubim, and the statement of the text, that he built one, is explained on the ground that the historian contrasts the "house of high places" with the "house of the Lord." Ewald, too, after <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29, 32</a>, understands the words as <span class="accented">plural</span>. But is it not more probable that a chapel or sanctuary already existed at Dan, where an irregular priesthood had ministered for more than four hundred years? This verse would then refer exclusively to Jeroboam's procedure at <span class="accented">Bethel</span> (see next verse). There he built a temple and ordained a number of priests, but Dan had both already. We know that the Danite priests carried on the calf worship to the time of the captivity (<a href="../../par/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>). This "house of high places" has grown in Ewald's pages into "a splendid temple in Canaanite style"], <span class="cmt_word">and made priests of the lowest of the people</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "<span class="accented">from the ends</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from all classes, <span class="accented">ex</span> <span class="accented">universe populo</span> (Gesen.), and not, as the writer explains presently, from the tribe of Levi alone. <a href="../../par/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>, <a href="../../par/judges/18-20.htm">Judges 18:20</a>, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2</a>, prove this to be the correct interpretation of the word. Rawlinson, who remarks that "Jeroboam could have no motive for specially selecting persons of low condition," does not thereby dispose of the A.V. rendering, for the historian might mean that <span class="accented">some</span> of Jeroboam's priests were of the lowest stamp, because he could find no others, or because he was so little scrupulous as to take them. "Leaden priests are well fitted to golden deities" (Hall)], <span class="cmt_word">which were not of the sons of Levi.</span> [Jeroboam would doubtless have been only too glad to have retained the services of the Levitical priests, but they went over in a body to Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13</a>). The statement of ver. 14, that, "Jeroboam and his sons" had "cast them out," suggests that they had refused to take part in his new cult and that thereupon he banished them, and, no doubt, confiscated their possessions. The idea of Stanley, that "following the precedent of the deposition of Abiathar by Solomon, he removed from their places the whole of the sacerdotal order," is a wild conjecture for which Scripture affords not the slightest warrant.]

This was the great feast of the year, and, as the feast of harvest or ingathering, the most joyous. See on 1 Kings 8:1. Had Jeroboam provided no counter attraction to this great festive gathering in Judah he might have found it a formidable temptation to his subjects. The reason usually given for the alteration of the time - in defiance of the law, which expressly fixed it in the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 39, 41</a>) - is that the eighth would be more generally convenient in the north, where the harvest or vintage was a month later (Then., Keil), as affording more time for the ingathering. In favour of this view is the consideration that the Jews not unfrequently had to intercalate a month - a second Adar - into their year, because of the season being a late one. Some of the older commentators, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., Vatab., think this time was chosen as the anniversary of his secession, but this is pure conjecture, and such an association would be contrary to the genius of the Hebrew people. Keil maintains that Jeroboam's design was to "make the separation, in a religious point of view, as complete as possible." But we can hardly be expected to believe that he altered the <span class="accented">month</span>, for the sake of creating a distinction, but "retained the <span class="accented">day</span> of the month, the fifteenth, for the sake of the weak who took offence at his innovations" (Keil).

(Keil contends that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> means "and he sacrificed," but this translation is without precedent. Ver. 33, "and he went up <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="accented">burn incense</span> is decisive as to the meaning.) the altar was always raised. It was probably approached by s slope, as <a href="../../par/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a> forbade steps, though it is by no means certain that they were not used even in Solomon's temple, and Jeroboam probably would have no scruples on such a minute point of ritual. It has been thought (Kitto, 4:147) that he was moved to officiate in person by the precedent of the Egyptian kings, who exercised priestly functions; but it is much more probable that he was guided by the example of Solomon at the dedication of the temple] <span class="cmt_word">upon</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he stood upon the ledge or platform (called in the A.V.

So did he in Bethel</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the feast was held at one centre only, and at Bethel alone the king offered in person. But I venture to suggest that instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, "so did he," etc., we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The LXX. seem to have had this word before them - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. And not only does this slight change bring the Hebrew into harmony with the LXX., but it also simplifies the construction. "He went up upon the altar which he made to sacrifice unto the calves which he made." The very tautology is instructive, as suggesting that altar, calves, and priests were all of Jeroboam's making, not of God's ordaining. The use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span> as a relative (  =   <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) is strictly grammatical], <span class="cmt_word">sacrificing</span> [marg., to <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>] <span class="cmt_word">unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel</span> [Dan being already provided with its priesthood] <span class="cmt_word">the priests of the high places</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of "the house of high places" (ver. 31).

See on 1 Kings 13:3 (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>).

It cannot be denied, however, that the word is generally used of incense, and it is very probable that both this and sacrifices were offered by Jeroboam on the same altar (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-8.htm">1 Kings 11:8</a>). We may perhaps see in Jeroboam's ministering in person, not only the design to invest the new ordinance with exceptional interest and splendour, but also the idea of encouraging his new priests to enter on their unauthorized functions with. out fear. The history, or even the traditions, of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10</a>.) and of Korah and his company (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>), and the threatenings of the law (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7, 22</a>, cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>), may well have made them hesitate. To allay their fears the king undertakes to offer the first of the sacrifices.
