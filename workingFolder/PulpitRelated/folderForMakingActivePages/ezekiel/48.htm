First, the portions north of the terumah (vers. 1-7); secondly, the terumah (vers. 8-22), embracing the portions of the priests and Levites (vers. 8-14), with the portions for the city (vers. 15-20) and the prince (vers. 21, 22); and thirdly, the portions south of the city (vers. 23-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">portions north of the terumah</span>.

The tribe of Levi Being excepted, the number twelve should in the future as in the past division of the holy soil be preserved by assigning to Joseph portions (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>), one for Ephraim and one for Manasseh. <span class="cmt_word">From the north end</span>. On the former occasion the allotment had begun in the south of the land and proceeded northwards; on this it should commence in the north and move regularly southward. The alteration is sufficiently explained by remembering that, after the conquest, the people were viewed as having come from the south, whereas at the restoration they should appear as entering in from the north. <span class="cmt_word">To the coast of</span> (better, <span class="accented">beside</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to</span> (literally, to the <span class="accented">entering in of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hamath, Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus.</span> This was the north boundary of the land from west to east, as already defined (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16, 17</a>); and with this line the portion of Dan should begin.

Then, as this applies equally to all the tribe-portions, Hengstenberg regards "to him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>) as pointing to "the whole of the tribes combined into an ideal unity," but expositors generally agree that "to him" should be referred to Dan, whom the prophet had in mind and was about to mention. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> portion for <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> should be <span class="accented">Dan one</span> "portion," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>), rather than "tribe," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, as Smend proposes. To take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> as alluding to the enumeration of the tribes is indeed countenanced by Ezekiel's mode of numbering the gates (vers. 30-35); but Ezekiel's style in vers. 30-35 will be preserved here also if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> precede "Judah," thus: "the portion of Danone." "The presupposition that one tribe should receive exactly as much as another led to the individual tribe's portion being considered as a <span class="accented">mona</span>s" (Kliefoth). In the first division of the land, Dan's portion was small, and situated west of the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin.

Havernick, after Gesenius, thinks of the workmen who should be employed in building the city, against which may be urged that the city is supposed to be already built. Hengstenberg, with whom Plumptre seems disposed to agree, can only see in the city servers "a militia who take the city in the midst." Keil and Kliefoth find them in the laboring classes, who should not in this future state, as so often in ordinary states among men, be destitute of a possession in land, but should receive an allotment for their maintenance. But an obvious objection to this view is that it hands over the city land exclusively to the laboring classes, <span class="accented">forgetting</span> that the "other" classes require support as well as they. Probably the best interpretation is to regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, "them that serve the city," as standing in antithesis to the other two classes already mentioned - the Levites, whose office should be to serve the tabernacle (see <a href="../../par/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> is employed to denote the service of the Levites); and the priests, whose special function should be to serve the altar (see <a href="../../par/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>, in which, again, the same verb is used). Thus regarded, "they that serve the city" will mean all engaged in secular pursuits in the city, which approximates to the view of Hitzig; and the prophet's language will signify that all such should derive their sustenance from the city lands, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> should either have direct access to these lands to cultivate them for themselves, or should obtain a share in the produce of these lands for other services rendered to the city. With this accords the further statement that those who served the city should serve it <span class="cmt_word">out of all the tribes of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its inhabitants should not, as formerly, be drawn chiefly from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, but contain representatives from all the tribes of Israel (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>).

Added together, they should form a square <span class="cmt_word">of five and twenty thousand</span> reeds. Hence it is added in the second clause, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall offer the holy oblation four square, with the possession of the city.</span> Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Keil translate, "To a fourth part shall ye lift off the holy terumah for a possession of the city," as if the sense were that the area of the city possession should be a fourth part of the area of the whole tern-mall. That 5000 of breadth is a fourth part of 20,000 of breadth may be admitted; but that the city portion was not in area a fourth of the other two, a little arithmetic will show - the area of the whole terumah being 25,000 &times; 25,000 reeds   =   625,000,000 square reeds, and that of the city possession being 5000 &times; 25,000 reeds   =   125,000,000 square reeds.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the residue <i>shall be</i> for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house <i>shall be</i> in the midst thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - The prince's portion should take up <span class="cmt_word">the residue</span> of the original oblation, or terumah (see ver. 8), from which had been withdrawn the aforesaid square containing the portions of the Levites, the priests, and the city. This residue should consist of two strips of land, situated one on each side of the holy oblation (here, of the priests and Levites) and of the possession of the city, and running along the whole length of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation (here the three portions composing the square), and extending eastward to the Jordan and westward to the Mediterranean. The last two clauses of ver. 21, which should read, And the holy <span class="accented">oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it</span>, implies that the two parts of the prince's portion, the eastern and the western, should be equal. Ver. 22 teaches that the whole intermediate territory between the border of Judah (in the north of the terumah) and the border of Benjamin (in the south of the terumah), from the possession of the Levites (the north portion of the terumah) and from (equivalent to "to") the possession of the city (the southern portion of the terumah), should belong to the prince. The mention of the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city as the extreme portions of the terumah, appears to indicate that the priests' portion lay between. Ewald translates as if the prophet meant to say the sanctuary should lie between the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city (in the first place), and between the two parts of the prince's land (in the second place), and yet again between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin (in the third place): but to read thus the text <span class="accented">must be</span> changed.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23</a></div><div class="verse">As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin <i>shall have</i> a <i>portion</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for the rest of the tribes</span>, these should follow on the south of the city portion, in parallel tracts, from east to west - <span class="cmt_word">Benjamin: Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Gad</span> - till the southern boundary of the land should be reached, which boundary is again defined as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>. Each tribe should receive, as those north of the terumah, one portion. The exact extent of this equal portion, though not stated, may be calculated - Latitude of entrance to Hamath 34&deg; 20' Latitude of Kadesh (say)           30&deg; 30'                                                    3&deg; 50' 60 &times; 3 5/6  -  230 geographical miles. But the whole breadth of the terumah was 25,000 reeds   =   37 geographical miles. Hence 230  -  37 - 193 miles, which, divided by 12, gives 16 miles of breadth (from north to south) for each portion. The precise length from east to west is more difficult to estimate, in consequence of the varying widths of the land. Accepting this, however, as 55 miles at Jerusalem, the breadth of the prince's portion from east to west would be only 2&frac12; miles on each side of the terumah; which, multiplied by 50 miles from north to south, would yield an area of 125 square miles on each side, or of 250 square miles in all. The disposition of the southern tribes differs from that made under the earlier division of the land - Simeon alone lying where he had been formerly placed, in the south quarter, Issachar and Zebulun being fetched from the north, Benjamin from the middle, and Gad from the west to keep him company. Upon the whole, the new arrangement has several marked peculiarities which distinguish it from the old. While agreeing with the old in this, that the three tribes, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali retain their original places in the north, and the temple is not deprived of its central position between Judah and Benjamin, it differs from the old in placing the three northern tribes side by side from west to east, but after one another from north to south, and exchanges the positions of Benjamin and Judah, transferring the former to the south and the latter to the north of the temple and the city. Then, while under the old neither priests, Levites, nor prince had a portion, all three obtain one in this. And, finally, while under the old no regard was had to the temple, in the new this forms the central point of the whole.

These should be twelve in number, three on each side, and named after the twelve tribes (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>). The gates leading northward should be those of Reuben, Judah, and Levi, all children of Leah (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32, 35</a>), as Keil observes, "the firstborn in age, the firstborn by virtue of the patriarchal blessing, and the one chosen by Jehovah for his own service in the place of the firstborn." The same three occupy the first three places and in the same order in the blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6-8</a>). Towards the east should lead the gates of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan, the first and second sons of Rachel, and the third a son of Rachel's handmaid (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18</a>). In the blessing of Moses Benjamin precedes Joseph (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12, 13</a>). The south gates receive the names of Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun, again all sons of Leah. The west gates are those of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, that is, two sons of Leah's handmaid and one of Rachel's. It is observable that in the naming of the gates Levi resumes his place among the tribes, which necessitates the substitution of Joseph the original tribe-father instead of Ephraim and Manasseh his two sons. (On the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">one gate of Judah</span>, literally, <span class="accented">the gate of Judah one</span>, see on ver. 1.)
