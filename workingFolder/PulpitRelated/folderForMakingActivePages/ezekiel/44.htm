To this door the prophet was conducted back, by way of the inner north or south gate, from the inner court, in which he had received the measurements of the altar and the instructions for its consecration (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>). Whether Ezekiel stood upon the outside of this door as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>, or upon its inside, cannot as yet be determined; but in either ease he observed that it was shut - again, whether on the east side towards the temple precincts, or on the west towards the outer court, is not mentioned, and cannot at this stage be decided. What led the seer to notice that the gate was closed was probably the circumstance that the last time he stood beside it it was open (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>), though proof cannot be given that he passed through it (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>), conjoined with the fact that it formed the principal entrance to the temple, and as such had been described to him and measured (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>).

That the gate of the new temple was to be closed only on the six working days Ewald mistakenly infers from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>, where he reads, after the LXX., the outer instead of the inner court. But <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a> refers to the east gate of the inner court. Of the east gate of the outer court it is declared emphatically that <span class="cmt_word">it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it,</span> meaning that it should be closed in perpetuity; and that not, as Abar-banel and Lightfoot have supposed, to express the idea that the glory of Jehovah should no more depart from the temple, but abide in it forever, but to inspire an exalted conception of the sanctity of the "house" and all its belongings, as Jehovah explained, <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</span>

The Revised Version accurately renders the words, <span class="accented">As for the prince</span>, <span class="accented">he shall sit therein as prince</span>, etc. That the "prince" here alluded to (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) could not have been the Prince David, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Messiah already spoken of (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>), but must have denoted the civic authorities of the new community of Israel, "the civil head of the theocracy," Havernick infers from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8, 9</a>, where the coming "prince" is contrasted with Israel's previous rulers who oppressed their subjects, from the absence of some such characteristic predicate as "shepherd" or "king," which would, he thinks, have been attached to the word "prince" had it been intended to designate Messiah, from the prince's offering for himself a sin offering (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>), from the allusion to his sons (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16</a>), and from what is recorded about his behavior in worship (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a>); but none of these statements concerning the "prince' forbids his identification with Messiah, unless on the supposition that it was already understood Messiah should be a Divine-human Personage. This, however, had not then been so distinctly revealed as to be widely and accurately known. Hence it seems enough to say that while the "prince" would have his highest antitype in the Messiah, he would also have, though in a lower and lesser degree, an antitype in every righteous ruler (if ever there should be such) who might subsequently preside over Israel (see on Ezekiel 37:25). The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">to eat bread before the Lord,</span> while referring in the first instance to those sacrificial meals which, under the Law, commonly accompanied unbloody offerings, as the meat offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), the showbread (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), and the unleavened leaves of the Passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>), and could only be partaken of by the priests, in the second instance signified to partake of sacrificial meals in general, even of such as consisted of the portions of flesh which were eaten in connection with ordinary bloody offerings (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). If, after Kliefoth, the former be adopted as the import of the phrase here, then the thought will be that in the new cultus the prince should enjoy a privilege which under the old was not possessed even by the king; if, after Keil, the second view be preferred, the sense will amount to this, that under the regulations of the future the prince should have the favor accorded him "of holding his sacrificial meals in the gate," whereas the people should only be permitted to hold theirs "in the court," or "in the vicinity of the sacrificial kitchens." <span class="cmt_word">The way of the porch</span> is mentioned as the ingress and egress for the prince; which implies that he should obtain access to the outer court by either the north or the south gate, since the outer door of the east gate was shut. This renders it probable that Ezekiel was himself standing on the outside of the east gate (see on ver. 1).

Ewald, Havernick, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Currey restrict the designation "strangers" to unfaithful and unauthorized priests, who, as in the days of Israel's apostasy, notoriously under Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>), may, in the confluence of idolatries that took place in Jerusalem during the reigns of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10-15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2-4, 23-25</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-7, 11, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-2.htm">2 Chronicles 33:2-7</a>), have been admitted to participate in the temple services; but Kliefoth, Delitzsch, Keil, Smend, and Plumptre, with better judgment, recognize in the "strangers" foreigners who had not incorporated themselves with Israel by submitting to circumcision, but, though dwelling in the midst of Israel, were still uncircumcised heathen in both heart and flesh. With regard to these foreigners, the Law of Moses (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8, 10</a>) enacted that, by accepting circumcision, they might become members of the Israelitish commonwealth, but that without this they could not be permitted to partake of the Passover, the highest symbol of national and religious unity (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>). Nevertheless, it was open to them, on giving a certain measure of obedience to the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16, 22</a>), to enter the sanctuary and present all sorts of offerings to Jehovah (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14, 29</a>) Hence Israel's offence had not been the admission of such "sons of the stranger" into the sanctuary, but the admission of them without insisting on the above specified conditions, in other words, the admission of such as not only lacked the bodily mark of circumcision - which would not have excluded them - but were destitute as well of the first elements of Hebrew piety, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were as uncircumcised in heart as they were in the flesh. The sanctioning of such within the temple courts, while Jehovah's bread, the fat and the blood, was being offered, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while sacrificial worship was being performed, was not simply a desecration of the "house," but was an express violation of the covenant Jehovah had made with Israel with reference to these very "sons of the stranger." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-8.htm">Ezekiel 44:8</a></div><div class="verse">And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Instead of having exercised a holy solicitude for the purity of the temple and the regularity of its rites, by keeping strict watch over the <span class="cmt_word">holy things</span> of Jehovah, the house of Israel had <span class="cmt_word">set keepers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">had set them</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the uncircumcised "strangers" above referred to, as keepers of Jehovah's <span class="cmt_word">charge in his sanctuary for themselves</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to please themselves, irrespective altogether of Jehovah's enactments. From this it has been argued, by Wellhausen, Smend, Driver, and others, that the "strangers" above mentioned had been not only allowed access to the outer court as spectators or as worshippers while the priests were offering sacrifice, but admitted to the inner court as assistants to the priests in their altar duties, that this, the employment of these heathen hierodules, had been the special wickedness of which Israel had been guilty, and that henceforward these "foreign ministers" were to be thrust out from their offices, and their places supplied by the about-to-be-degraded Levites. It is, however, doubtful if the phrase, <span class="accented">keepers of my charge in the sanctuary</span>, can be made to signify more than has already been expressed by the clause, "to be in my sanctuary...  when ye offer my bread" (ver. 7), by which, as Kliefoth and Keil explain, Israel had practically made these strangers "keepers of Jehovah's charge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> observers of the rites of worship prescribed by him, though observers in their way, not in his; if more can be extracted from the words, then the most they can be legitimately made to affirm (as there is no mention of the inner court) is that these "strangers," in addition to obtaining access to the outer court to witness the sacrifices, or perhaps offer such for themselves, had been more or less frequently employed in performing subordinate offices towards the Levites, who were the proper priests' assistants, like the Gibeonites, whom Joshua (Joshua 9:27) made "hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord unto this day," and like the Nethinim, whom, according to Ezra (Ezra 8:20), David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites (see Delitzsch, Luthardt's 'Zeitschrift fur kirchliche Wissenschaft,' 1880, p. 283). (On the phrase, "to keep the charge of Jehovah," as signifying to follow his directions or comply with his prescriptions, see <a href="../../par/numbers/9-23.htm">Numbers 9:23</a>.) "In the sanctuary" explains that the prescriptions alluded to were those pertaining to the sanctuary or to the worship of Jehovah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-9.htm">Ezekiel 44:9</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that <i>is</i> among the children of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-16.</span> - Accordingly, that no such abuses might creep in to desecrate the temple of the future, a new Torah was promulgated concerning the persons who should have a right to participate in its services. If the "prince" is omitted, the reason probably was that a special section is subsequently devoted to him (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-8</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- The ordinance for the people</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>No stranger</span> (or, <span class="accented">alien</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary.</span> The publication of this edict marked a clear advance upon preceding legislation. The old Torah conceded right of access to a foreigner, though uncircumcised, on certain conditions (ver. 7); this new Torah would accord such right of access to a foreigner on no conditions. Even should he be circumcised in the flesh, unless he possessed also that which the bodily mark symbolized, viz. circumcision of heart, he must remain without.

According to the so-called priest-code, the Levites were Levi's descendants, who were chosen by Jehovah for service in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-9.htm">Numbers 16:9</a>), to minister to the priests when these sacrificed in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>), and in particular to keep the charge of the tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the house and all its vessels (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>), as distinguished from the charge of the sanctuary and of the altar, which pertained to Aaron and his sons alone as priests (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-2.htm">Numbers 18:2-6, 23</a>). The Deuteronomic code, says Wellhausen ('Geschichte Israels,' pp. 121, etc.), was unacquainted with any such distinction between Levites and priests, who, it is alleged, composed one homogeneous body, the tribe of Levi, whose members were equally empowered to officiate at the altar (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), the lower duties of the tabernacle having been performed by the aforesaid strangers, and the subordination of Levites to priests having first been suggested by Ezekiel (comp. Smend, 'Der Prophet Ezekiel,' p. 361, "<span class="accented">Der</span> <span class="accented">unterschied zwischen Priestern und Leviten ist hier im Enstehn begriffen"</span>), and first formally carried out alter the exile. This theory, however, cannot be admitted as made out in face of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>, which (ver. 1) recognizes "the priests" and" the Levites" as constituting "the whole tribe of Levi," and (ver. 3, 6) distinguishes between "the priest" and "the Levite;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>, which associates with Zadok the priest, the Levites as carriers of the ark; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>, in which the same distinction between the two bodies is recognized; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> 1 and 2 Chronicles, <span class="accented">passim</span>, which attest the existence of priests and Levites as separate temple officials in pre-exilic times; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <a href="../../par/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>, 62; Ezra 3:8, 10; 6:20, which show that the distinction, alleged to have been first made by Ezekiel, was well known to the first company of exiles who returned under  Zerubbabel to Jerusalem, and was by them traced back to pre-exilic times (see Keil, on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:1; Curtiss's 'Levitical Priests,' pp. 22, etc.; Delitzsch, in Luthardt's 'Zeit-schrift fur kirchliche Wissensehaft,' pp. 286, etc., aud in Riehm's ' Handworterbuch des Biblischen Alterthums,' art. "Leviten;" Oehler, in Herzog's 'Real-Encyclopadie,' art. "Levi"). The question, therefore, of which Levites Ezekiel speaks in this verse, whether of those whose duties were of a menial order or of those whose functions partook of a priestly character, is not difficult to resolve. It could hardly have been the former, since in vers. 11-14 Ezekiel's Levites are represented as about to be degraded by being relegated to inferior tasks than those they had formerly performed; it must have been the latter, because in the present verse they are designated the <span class="cmt_word">Levites that are gone away</span> (or, <span class="accented">went</span>) <span class="cmt_word">far from me, when Israel went astray</span>. Now, Israel's apostasy from Jehovah and declension towards idolatry began with Solomon's unfaithfulness (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>), and continued with greater or less intensity in every subsequent reign till the exile; it certainly cannot be restricted, as Keil and Currey propose, to Jeroboam's conduct in setting up rival sanctuaries in Dan and Bethel, with altars and priests, for the accommodation of the northern kingdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>). Nor is there room for doubting, although historical notices of the fact are not abundant, that in this apostasy the priesthood largely led the way (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>), becoming priests of the high places, ministering for the people at heathen altars, and so causing them to fall into iniquity (ver. 12). Hengstenberg and Plumptre suggest that the reason why these apostate priests are now called Levites was to intimate that they were no more worthy of the priesthood, and were about to be reduced to the lower ministry of the Levites so called. Consequently, under the new Torah, those among the priests (who were also Levites) who had been guilty of this flagrant wickedness (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, says Delitzsch, all the Aaronides who were not Zadokitos) would no more, either in themselves or their descendants, be suffered to retain the priestly office, but would be degraded to the status of ordinary Levites, and, like them, should be <span class="cmt_word">ministers</span> in Jehovah's <span class="cmt_word">sanctuary</span>, having <span class="cmt_word">charge</span> <span class="accented">- or</span>, <span class="accented">oversight</span> (Revised Version) - at the gates of the house, and ministering, to (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) the house, i.e. in its courts, serving as keepers of the charge of the house (ver. 14), as watchers at the gates of the house (ver. 11), as slaughterers of the sacrificial victims (ver. 11), but should not, like their brethren who had remained faithful, be allowed to do the office of a priest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> approach the altar to offer sacrifice, or to enter into the holy place (ver. 13).

The priesthood, at its institution, having been entrusted to Aaron and his sons (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>), on Aaron's death the high priesthood passed into the hands of Eleazar, his eldest (living) son (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26-28</a>), and after Eleazar's death into those of Phinehas, his eldest son (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11-13</a>). In the last days of the judges, when the ark and tabernacle stood at Shiloh, the high priesthood belonged to Eli, of the line of Ithamar (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a> and 1 Sam 22:20 with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>), in which line it continued till the reign of David, when it was held conjointly by Abiathar (called also Ahimelech) of the line of Ithamar, and Zadok of the line of Eleazar (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a>). This arrangement, however, Solomon eventually overturned, by deposing the former for espousing Adonijah's pretensions to the throne (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and from that time forward till the exile the high priesthood remained with Zadok and his sons (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). When, therefore, it is announced to Ezekiel that his vision-sanctuary should have as <span class="cmt_word">priests the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of Jehovah's sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from him</span>; the first question that arises is - To <span class="accented">what does this allude?</span> Kliefoth holds it cannot mean that, while Israel as a whole declined into idolatry, the Zadokite priests remained faithful to the worship of Jehovah, because the vision of Judah's idolatries granted to the prophet, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, revealed quite clearly that the priesthood was as much caught in the national apostasy as were the princes or the people. Nor is the language of the text perfectly satisfied by the view of  Havernick, Keil, Delitzsch, and others, that it goes beck to Zadok's fidelity to the throne of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>), a fidelity exhibited also by Abiathar, or to his adherence to Solomon in preference to Adonijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8, 39</a>), this time without Abiathar's concurrence, rather in the face of his opposition. In neither of these instances was Zadok's fidelity specially directed towards Jehovah's sanctuary, but concerned expressly and exclusively David's throne. Hence the commendation of the Zadokites' fidelity can only signify that, while the priesthood as a body were corrupt like the people, there were among them, as among the people, some who, like Ezekiel, continued steadfast to Jehovah's sanctuary; that these faithful few were Zadokites (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>), and that to these should be entrusted the priesthood in the new sanctuary. But, at this point, a second question <span class="accented">starts - Was it intended to declare that the new priesthood should be Zadokites in body</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of lineal descent, or <span class="accented">only in soul</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of moral and religious excellence? The former is contended by Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, and others, who see in the vision-sanctuary a plan of the second, or post-exilic, temple, and in its ordinances a program for the establishment of the Levitical hierarchy; but this contention shatters itself on the fact that no proof exists either that the second temple was constructed after Ezekiel's as a model, or that those who served in it were exclusively flesh and blood Zadokites. The latter opinion, favored by Kliefoth, appears the more correct, that moral and spiritual resemblance to the sons of Zadok should form the first qualification for the priesthood in this ideal sanctuary of the future (see note at the end of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>.).

The reason for the prohibition of wool is hinted at in ver. 18 - it was apt to cause sweat, and thus entail impurity; the clean white linen, on the other hand, was designed both for hygienic reasons and as an emblem of purity (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8, 14</a>).

Gesenius reverses this meaning, making the former the ordinary round cap, and the latter a tiara (see for the former, <a href="../../par/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-28.htm">Exodus 39:28</a>; and for the latter, <a href="../../par/exodus/39-28.htm">Exodus 39:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17, 23</a>).

The obligation to let the hair grow freely was imposed upon the Nazarite only during the period of his vow (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). The verb "to poll," or "cut" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>), occurs nowhere else. Smend thinks what is here denied to the priests collectively is in the priest-code denied solely to the high priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, Revised Version; compare, however, <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>, Revised Version), and discovers in this a sign of the later origin of Leviticus. Ezekiel's raising the priesthood as a body to the rank of the high priest, of whom in connection with this temple is no trace, rather proves Ezekiel to have been later than Leviticus.

Ezekiel's enactment discovers two variations - first, that it does not formally forbid to the priests marriage with a harlot; and, second, that it sanctions marriage with a priest's widow. But the first was implied in the prohibition of marriage with an adulteress, and the second was a sign of the higher sanctity of the priesthood belonging to Ezekiel's temple.

As under the Law, so in the ideal constitution of Ezekiel, the priests should not be at liberty to contract ceremonial impurity through touching a corpse except in the case of near relations (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>). That neither in Leviticus nor in Ezekiel is the priest's wife among the excepted is surprising, and hardly to be explained, with Knobel, on the ground that a wife is not a blood-relation, since according to the Divine conception of marriage husband and wife are one (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), but either by holding, with Keil, that the wife, who stands nearer her husband than any of the relatives named, was viewed as included under the phrase, "and for his kin that is near unto him" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-2.htm">Leviticus 21:2</a>), or by supposing it self-evident that such defilement could not be avoided in the case of a wife and was therefore tacitly allowed. Smend, as usual, finds signs of Ezekiel's priority to the priest-code, first in the circumstance that Ezekiel regarded it as perfectly natural that a priest should sorrow for his wife (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15-18</a>), which showed he had no acquaintance with <a href="../../par/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a>; and secondly, in the fact that <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> prohibits absolutely to the high priest all contact with a corpse, which, it is argued, betrays a greater strictness than existed in the days of Ezekiel. But as the prohibition in <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> applies only to the high priest, who in Ezekiel's temple has no place, an argument as to which of the books had priority of origin cannot properly be founded on so insecure a Basis. Knobel remarks on <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a> that "among the Greeks, priests and priestesses remained at a distance from funerals (Plato, 'De Legg.,' 12. p. 947); while among the Romans ought the <span class="accented">Flamen dialis</span> to touch no corpse (Gell., 10:15), the augur perform no funeral rites (Tacit., 'Ann.,' 1:31), and the pontifex accompany no funeral procession (Die Cass., 56:31); not at all should he behold a dead body (Serv., 'Ad AEn.,' 6:176),and in case he had occasion to pronounce a funeral oration, a curtain should hang between him and the corpse." As to the cleansing of a defiled priest, that should be conducted in accordance with the customary regulations (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>.),with this difference - that on the termination of the ordinary rites, which extended over seven days, an additional seven days, according to Havernick and Keil (though Hengstenberg and Plumptre decide for only one heptade), should elapse, at the end of which, on the presentation of a sin offering, he should be restored to service in the inner sanctuary.

Smend thinks Ezekiel was scarcely accurate in describing the priests as landless in the sense intended by the Deuteronomist and the priest-code, since in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a> they are, after all, furnished with a plot of ground on which to build their houses and erect their sanctuary; whilst Wellhansen ('Gesehichte Israels,' p. 165) holds the priest-code to have somewhat romanced in adopting the same language about the Aaronides and Levites, since, if they really did obtain forty-eight cities, "what were these if not a lot and a land tract, and that too a comparatively great and important one?" Neither view stands in need of refutation.

The burnt offering is omitted, because it was entirely consumed upon the altar, with the exception of the hide or skin, which under the Law became a perquisite of the officiating priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>). That Ezekiel is silent about this, while the requirement of <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>, that the priest should obtain the breast with the right shoulder of every fire offering, goes beyond the prescription of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>, that the shoulder, two cheeks, and the maw should be the priest's portion, is regarded by Wellhausen and Smend as a proof that Ezekiel stands between Deuteronomy and the priest-code. But as Ezekiel does not condescend upon the particular parts which should be reserved from the fire offerings, it is impossible to say whether he held with the Deuteronomist or the writer of the priest-code, supposing them to be different; and, inasmuch as <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> speaks of an offerings, by fire that was first paid to Jehovah and by him afterwards handed over to Aaron and his sons, while <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a> treats of the dues which should be paid by the people directly to the priests, it is clear that both practices may have existed together instead of the one (the former) coming in as an advance upon the other (the latter); see Keil on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:3.

The first of all the firstfruits of everything cannot surely mean of everything except cattle. If Ezekiel does not give the tenths of the tithes to the priests, he still assigns them to the sanctuary (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-14.htm">Ezekiel 45:14</a>).
