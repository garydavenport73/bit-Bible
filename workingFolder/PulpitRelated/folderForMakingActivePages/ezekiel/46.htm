The prince should reach his station at the threshold of the inner gate, <span class="cmt_word">by the way of the porch of that</span> (or, the) <span class="cmt_word">gate without</span>; but whether this signified that he should pass through the eastern gate of the outer court, and so advance towards the inner east gate, as Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, and Plumptre assume, or, as Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Smend suppose, that he should enter the inner gate by the way of the porch of the gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the outside, from the outer court into which he had previously entered through either the north or the south outer gates, cannot be decided. In favor of the former may be urged the consideration that it seems more natural to apply <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> to the outer gate than to the outer court, since no, one could enter the inner gate except from the outer court, unless he were already in the inner court; but in favor of the latter is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the stringent character of the language in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a>, which expressly declares that the outer east gate should not be opened, and that no man <span class="accented">should enter in by it</span>, thus scarcely admitting of an exception; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the statement in vers. 9, 10 of the present chapter, that in the "appointed feasts" the prince and the people alike should enter the outer court either by the north or the south gate, since, if any of these "feasts" fell upon a sabbath, this regulation would not be practicable, if the prince and the people were required to enter by different doors. The question, however, in itself is immaterial. The points of importance are that the prince should worship in the porch of the inner gate, and that, on finishing his worship, he should retire, and that the gate should not be shut; until the evening. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Ezekiel 46:3</a></div><div class="verse">Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise</span> (or, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to the people of the land</span> should be accorded permission to worship at this inner gate, only not like the prince, in its porch, but at its door, yet on the same occasions as he, <span class="cmt_word">in the sabbaths and in the new moons</span>. Kliefoth, who takes "this gate" to signify the outer gate, through which, according to his interpretation of ver. 2 (see above), the prince should pass so as to reach the inner east gate, conceives the import of the present verse to be that, while the prince should be permitted on the sabbaths and new moons to pass through the eastern gate, the people "should remain standing in front of the outer east gate, and, looking through it and the opened inner east gate, should pray before Jehovah." This, however, is unnatural, even on the hypothesis that the prince should pass through the outer east gate, and the view of Keil is greatly preferable, that "this gate" was <span class="accented">the inner east gate</span>, and that the people should reach it (even if the prince did not) by entering the outer court through the north gate or the south.

In order to prevent confusion, and that all might be conducted with propriety (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>), no one should depart by the gate through which he had entered, but by the opposite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he who had entered by the north gate should retire through the south gate, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>. Hengstenberg thinks the reason for this regulation "cannot be sought in the endeavor to avoid a throng," since "in that case it must have been ordained that all should go in by the same gate and go out by the opposite one;" it must, he holds, have been "a theological one," viz. "to signify that each should go out of the sanctuary another man than he came in." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in,</span> etc. Schroder, but without reason, would restrict this regulation to the celebrations of the first and seventh days of the first month (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18, 20</a>); Hengstenberg would confine it to the high festivals (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-21.htm">Ezekiel 45:21, 25</a>); Kliefoth, Keil, and commentators generally apply it to all the statutory feasts or appointed seasons and times for united sacrificial worship. The regulation seems to teach that in such observances at least the prince should stand on a level with the people, and both enter and retire by the same door as they. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-11.htm">Ezekiel 46:11</a></div><div class="verse">And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> specifies <span class="cmt_word">the meat</span> (or, <span class="accented">meal</span>) <span class="cmt_word">offering</span> which should be presented in the feasts (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), or high festivals, as the Passover and Feast of Tabernacles, and in the solemnities (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), or appointed feasts generally, viz. <span class="cmt_word">an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give</span> (comp. vers. 5, 7), <span class="cmt_word">with a hin of oil to an ephah</span>.

In this case the east inner gate should be opened to him as on the sabbath days (see ver. 1), but, differently from what occurred on the sabbath, it should not remain open till the evening (ver. 2), but should be shut immediately the prince's offering was done.

This difference was not accidental, but intentional, though why in the new order of things the evening sacrifice should have been omitted does not appear. Currey thinks Ezekiel did not intend to enumerate all the sacrifices of the Law, but only a few of them, and that, though not mentioned, the evening sacrifice may have been designed to be retained. The presentation of these sacrifices was not to be the special duty of the prince, but should devolve upon the community as a whole, who are now addressed as "thou" (vers. 13, 14) and "they" (ver. 15), and who should act in its fulfillment through their priests.

This passage has been transferred by Ewald to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42.htm">Ezekiel 42</a>, and inserted after ver. 14; but the Exposition will show it must have originally stood where it is. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After</span> (or, and) <span class="cmt_word">he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the measuring man, who had hitherto acted as the prophet's conductor - <span class="cmt_word">brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate.</span> This was the inner north gate, from which the prophet had been conducted to the front of the house in order to receive the sacrificial Torah (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>), and to which, when this was finished, he had been seemingly led back. From this gate, then, he was taken by his guide along the entry or passage (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-9.htm">Ezekiel 42:9</a>), which ran towards and extended in front of <span class="cmt_word">the holy chambers of</span> (or, for) <span class="cmt_word">the priests, which looked toward the north</span>, and which had already been described (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a>). Arrived at the western corner of the chambers, he perceived <span class="cmt_word">a place on the two sides</span> - or, on the <span class="accented">hinder part</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">westward</span>. The translation in the Authorized Version was obviously suggested by the dual form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, which properly signifies "on both sides" but when applied to the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-23.htm">Exodus 26:23</a>) or temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>), always describes the back part or rear. That a similar "place" existed on the south side is more than probable; though Smend thinks there was not a "place" on the south. The LXX. omits the words after "place," and supplies <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "separated." Keil finds in the description here given of the passage towards the holy chambers a proof that this section could not have steed originally after <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>, as in that ease no such description would have been needed. Nor would the language in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, "and he brought me back," have been required or appropriate had the prophet not in the mean while changed his place, which he does to visit the holy chambers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a></div><div class="verse">Then said he unto me, This <i>is</i> the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear <i>them</i> not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The "place" was designed as a kitchen where the priests should boil the trespass and the sin offerings and bake the meat (or, meal) offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cook the portions of the sacrifices they should eat in their official capacity (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). The Law of Moses (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>) required the flesh to be boiled (and probably also the flour to be baked) at the tabernacle door. The last clause, <span class="cmt_word">that they</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the priests, <span class="cmt_word">bear</span> them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the offerings, <span class="cmt_word">not out into the utter</span> (or, outer) <span class="cmt_word">court, to sanctify the people</span>, is by most interpreters understood in the sense of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a> (which see). To this, however, Kliefoth objects that the conception of deriving ceremonial sanctity from contact with such offerings is completely strange to the Old Testament (see <a href="../../par/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), and accordingly he connects the words. "to sanctify the people," with the "baking" and "boiling" of the preceding clause.

According to the last clause of ver. 22, <span class="cmt_word">these four corners were of one measure</span>; or, <span class="accented">one measure</span> was <span class="accented">to the four cut-away places</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> corners, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> being the hoph. participle of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, "to cut off." This last word is omitted in the LXX. and the Vulgate, Hitzig, and Smend, the <span class="accented">puncta extraordinaria</span> showing that the Massorites regarded it as suspicious.
