The two sections of the chapter, Vers. 1-16 and 17-32, belong to the same year, and probably, though the date of the month is net given for the second, were written within a fortnight of each other. The thoughts of the prophet still dwell upon the downfall of Egypt, and he is stirred, as by a special inspiration, to write an elaborate "lamentation" over its departed greatness. It would seem, from the repetition of the word in Ver. 16, as if the elegy had originally been intended to end there. Possibly it may have occurred to the prophet that what he had written was rather a prediction of coming evil than a lamentation, and therefore needed to be completed by a second, coming more strictly under that title. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou <i>art</i> as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art like a young lion</span>; rather, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">thou wast likened unto a young lion</span>. The two clauses of the verse stand in direct contrast to each other. Flatterers, <span class="accented">orators</span>, courtiers, had used the usual symbolism of the animal world. The King of Egypt was as the king of beasts. Ezekiel rejects that comparison, and likens him rather to the <span class="cmt_word">whale</span>, the dragon (Revised Version), in the seas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the crocodile of his own river (compare the use of the "dragon" for the King of Egypt, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). Ewald and Smend, however, translate, "young lion of the nations, thou art brought to naught;" but there is no adequate reason for abandoning the Revised translation. <span class="cmt_word">Troubledst the waters</span>. As in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a>, the act is used as the symbol of all selfish and aggressive rule, defiling the streams of righteousness and judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Thou camest forth with thy rivers.</span> Ewald and Smend translate, "Thou didst spurt out the water," as describing the act of the crocodile when it raises its head out of the water as in the "neesings," or "sneezings" of <a href="../../par/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>, Hebrew [English version, 18]. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-3.htm">Ezekiel 32:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will spread out my net.</span> The imagery of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a> is repeated, with a variation as to the mode of capture. There is no evidence that the crocodile was ever taken with a net; but Ezekiel may have chosen the comparison for that very reason. What was impossible in the parable, according to its letter, was possible when it received its application. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-4.htm">Ezekiel 32:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The picture is carried out to its completion. The carcass of the crocodile becomes the prey of unclean birds and beasts. The carcass of the Egyptian greatness was to satiate the appetite of the invading hosts. Were the words of <a href="../../par/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a>, as to leviathan being "given for meat to the people in the wilderness" floating in Ezekiel's mind (compare the strange reference to leviathan in 2 Esdr. 6:49, 52, and in later Jewish traditions)? Greek writers describe the ichthyophagi of Africa as  feeding on the flesh of sea-monsters (Died. Sic, 3:14; Herod., 2:69; Strabo, p. 773), and the word may possibly include the crocodile. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5</a></div><div class="verse">And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.</div><div class="comm">

Was the plague of the water of the Nile turned to blood (<a href="../../par/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19, 20</a>) present to Ezekiel's mind? Such an inundation of the Nile, in all its horrors, was a fit symbol of the deluge of invaders by whom Egypt was laid waste. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a></div><div class="verse">And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I shall put thee out</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">extinguish</span>. The verb is used of lamps in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>. The change of metaphor is at first startling, but I follow Ewald, Hitzig, and Smend, in thinking that there is a traceable sequence of ideas. The "dragon of the Egyptian waters" suggested the "dragon" which was conspicuous between Ursa Major and Minor among the constellations of the heavens, and the name of which, probably derived by the Greek astronomers from a remote past, suggested that of an enemy of God (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). So taken, the new comparison finds a parallel in that of the King of Babylon to Lucifer, the morning star, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>. Upon this there follows naturally the imagery of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. As the other trees of the forest had mourned for the cedar (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>), so the other lights of heaven mourn for that particular star which has been quenched for ever (comp. for the general imagery. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>, Hebrew ['English version, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2.htm">Ezekiel 2</a>:31]. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-8.htm">Ezekiel 32:8</a></div><div class="verse">All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm">

The words intensify the bitterness of the downfall. The prophet passes out of the region of metaphors into that of facts. The fall of Egypt will cause pity among the nations. They shall simply be "vexed" in heart, terrified at the thought (Ver. 10) that the sword which had laid her low was "brandished" also against them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-10.htm">Ezekiel 32:10</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at <i>every</i> moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-11.htm">Ezekiel 32:11</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sword of the King of Babylon</span>, etc. The effects of Nebuchadnezzar's invasion are now described in language which seems plain enough, but in which we may read between the lines an allusive reference to the previous symbolism. Thus in Ver. 13 we are thrown back upon the thought of the "troubled waters" of Ver. 2. The Nile was no longer to be troubled by the foot of beasts; the streams of justice were no longer to be defiled with a selfish corruption, but were to run smooth and calm, even as the "rivers of oil" which were the symbols of ethical blessedness (<a href="../../par/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>). So Ewald and Keil, for once agreeing. The rule of Nebuchadnezzar was to be a righteous rule, in spite of its severity. I am unable, however, to follow these commentators further in seeing in the words a prediction of the Messianic kingdom. The Egyptians were to "know the Lord," as the other nations addressed by Ezekiel were to know him, as a righteous Judge, not as yet as a Deliverer (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a>).

Taken together, the two passages give a vivid picture of the thoughts of the Hebrews as to the unseen world, and we find in them the germs of the later belief of Judaism in Paradise and Gehenna. What I have called the Dante element in Ezekiel it seen here raised to its highest power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast them down</span>, etc. The prophet thinks of himself as not only the predictor, but the minister, of the Divine judgments. So it was given to Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>) "to root out and to pull down," and to Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>) to "smite" and to wound. He executes the sentence, not on Egypt only, but on the other <span class="cmt_word">daughters of the famous nations</span>, <span class="accented">sc</span>. on the nations themselves, especially those that are named in the verses that follow. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, <i>even</i> her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.</div><div class="comm">

The lamentation, as might be expected from Ezekiel's standpoint, is an illustration of irony and triumph rather than of sorrow. The question implies a negative answer. Glorious as Egypt had been, other nations had equaled her. They had passed away, and so should she. <span class="cmt_word">With the uncircumcised</span>. The words, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>, suggest the thought that Israel, so far as it was faithful to its calling, circumcised in heart as well as flesh (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>), had a higher and happier dwelling in Hades than the uncircumcised heathen. As the Egyptians practiced circumcision, the language of the prophet had a special significance. Their place in Hades was among the heathen to whom that hereto was unknown. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-20.htm">Ezekiel 32:20</a></div><div class="verse">They shall fall in the midst of <i>them that are</i> slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She is delivered to the sword</span>; better, with the margin of the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the sword is appointed - possibly, as</span> Ewald suggests, with reference to the practice of burying a warrior with his sword beneath his head (comp. Ver. 27). <span class="cmt_word">Draw her</span>, etc. The command would seem to be given, so to speak, to the warders of Sheol.

The verses that follow contain, as it were, the prophet's retrospect of the history of the past, as far as he had knowledge of it. Foremost in those is Assyria, which the prophet had already chosen (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>) as the pattern instance of a fallen greatness. <span class="cmt_word">There in the sides of the pit</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in its remotest and deepest regions) lie the graves of the rulers surrounded by those of their subjects.

Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:34-39) had uttered a special prophecy against it. From Ezekiel's point of view it might well take its place among the powers that had received their death-blow at the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Yet have they borne their shame</span>; sc. the disgrace of being uncircumcised, and therefore taking their place with the lower circles of the dead.

In the rest of the verse Ezekiel reiterates what had been said in Ver. 24 with an emphatic solemnity. In the Hebrew, as in the English, there is a constant variation in the pronouns used, now masculine, now feminine, now singular. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a></div><div class="verse">There <i>is</i> Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves <i>are</i> round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is Meshech, Tubal</span>. (On the ethnological relations of the two tribes, see note on Ezekiel 27:13, and later on in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>, and 39.) Ezekiel obviously speaks of them as one of the powers that bad been conspicuous in his own time, and had been, in part at least, overthrown by the Chaldean monarchy. We may probably connect his words with the great irruption of the Scythians mentioned by Herodotus (1. 103; 4:11) as having swept over Asia even to Palestine and Egypt, in the time of Josiah, and which, after compelling Cyaxares to raise the siege of Nineveh, left traces of itself in the name of the city of Scythe-polls. Many commentators find a reference to that invasion in the "evil from the north" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; and in <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13-16</a>. They also, once the terror of the nations, are now represented by the prophet as in the shadow-world of Sheol. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-27.htm">Ezekiel 32:27</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall not lie with the mighty <i>that are</i> fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though <i>they were</i> the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall not lie with the mighty</span>. The words seem at first to contradict Ver. 26. The LXX. meets the difficulty by omitting the negative; Ewald and Havernick, by taking it as an interrogative, "Shall they not lie," etc.? Probably the explanation is laying stress on the word "mighty." Meshech and Tubal have a lower place in Hades; they are buried without the honors of war. Their swords are not placed beneath their heads (for the practice thus referred to, see Died. Sic., 18:26; Arrian, 1:5; Virg., 'AEn.,' 6:233). For the Scythians, who worshipped the sword (Herod., L 62), this would be the extremest ignominy. In this way their iniquities should be <span class="cmt_word">upon their bones</span> as they lay dishonored.

Whatever shadow of power might yet remain to it, Ezekiel, from his standpoint, could yet declare that her greatness had departed. The exultation which the Edomites had shown over the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>) would naturally tend to accentuate the prophet's language. The "princes" of Edom are probably identical with the "dukes" of <a href="../../par/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15-43</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>, where the word means literally the heads or captains of thousands, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of tribes, as in <a href="../../par/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-5.htm">Zechariah 12:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-30.htm">Ezekiel 32:30</a></div><div class="verse">There <i>be</i> the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with <i>them that be</i> slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There be the princes of the north</span>. The noun for "princes" is different from that of Ver. 29, and has the sense of "vassal rulers," as in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-21.htm">Joshua 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>. So we have the "kings of the north" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>. The fact that they are coupled with the <span class="cmt_word">Zidonians</span> (it is suggestive that Ezekiel names these rather than the Tyrians) points in the direction of Northern Syria, including cities like Damascus, Hamath, Arpad, and others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-31.htm">Ezekiel 32:31</a></div><div class="verse">Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, <i>even</i> Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be comforted</span>, etc. (comp. for the thought, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>). That shall be all that he will have to console him. As before, other nations were comforted by the downfall of Egypt, so Egypt in her turn finds her comfort in their downfall. All are sharers alike in the fiend-like temper which exults in the miseries of others.  Ewald and Hitzig, here as there, take the word as in the sense of "mourning over." As to the extent and manner in which the predictions of the chapter have been fulfilled, see notes on Ezekiel 29. - 31. Sufficient evidence has been given that Egypt was probably invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. The silence of the Greek historians, and notably of Herodotus, as to any such invasion goes for little or nothing. He could not read the Egyptian records, and derived his knowledge from the priests through an interpreter. They, after their manner, would draw a veil over all disasters, and so, while he records the revolution which placed Amasis upon the throne of Hophra, he is silent as to any invasion, and does not even mention the battle of Carchemish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
