Two months all but six days had passed since the utterance of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-20.htm">Ezekiel 30:20-26</a>, when Ezekiel was moved to expand his prediction of the downfall of Egypt into a parable which is partly a <span class="accented">replica</span> of these in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17.htm">Ezekiel 17</a>. and Ezekiel 19:1-14, and which also finds a parallel in <a href="../../par/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-14</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-2.htm">Ezekiel 31:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The parable is addressed, not to <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh</span> only, but to <span class="cmt_word">his multitude</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>,  as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>, for his auxiliary forces. It opens with one of the customary formulae of an Eastern apologue (<a href="../../par/mark/4-30.htm">Mark 4:30</a>), intended to sharpen the curiosity and win the attention of the prophet's hearers or readers. It is significant that the question is repeated at the close of the parable, as if the prophet had left the interpretation to his readers, as our Lord does in saying, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the Assyrian <i>was</i> a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon</span>. The Hebrew text, as rendered in all versions and interpreted by most commentators, gives us, in the form of the parable of the cedar, the history of the Assyrian empire in its glory and its fall. That had passed away in spite of its greatness, and so should Egypt. The question in Ver. 18 takes the place of "Thou art the man!" in Nathan's interpretation of his parable (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), or the <span class="accented">mutato nominee de te fabula, narratur</span> of the Roman satirist. Some recent commentaters, however, either like Ewald, taking the Hebrew word for, Assyrian" as describing a particular kind of cedar or fir tree, or, like Comill and amend, adopting a conjectural emendation of the text which actually gives that meaning (<span class="accented">Tasshur</span> for <span class="accented">Asshur</span>), refer the whole parable primarily to Egypt, and dwell on the fact that the words of Vers. 10, 18 are addressed to the living representative of a great monarchy, and not to a power that has already passed away into the Hades of departed glory. The former view seems to me the more tenable of the two, and I therefore adopt it throughout the chapter. It may be admitted, however, that the inner meaning of the parable at times breaks through the outward imagery, as was indeed to be expected, the prophet seeking to apply his apologue even before he had completed it. The "cedar in Lebanon" has already met us as the symbol of s kingdom, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The shadowing shroud</span> may be noted as a specially vivid picture of the peculiar foliage of the cedar rendered with singular felicity. <span class="cmt_word">His top was among the thick boughs</span>; better, <span class="accented">clouds, as</span> in the margin of the Revised Version. So Keil, Smend, and others (comp. Vers. 10, 14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a></div><div class="verse">The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The waters made him great</span>. The scenery is hardly that of Lebanon, but finds its counterpart in that of the Nile, perhaps also of the Tigris, with the waters of the river diverted into streams and channels by a careful system of irrigation. The cedar grew close to the river itself; the other <span class="cmt_word">trees of the field</span> were watered only by the smaller channels, and so were inferior to it in the fullness of their growth. (For the general imagery, comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-5.htm">Ezekiel 31:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a></div><div class="verse">All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the fowls of heaven</span> as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>, was the natural symbol of the fact that all the neighboring nations owned the sovereignty of Assyria and were sheltered by her protection. In the <span class="cmt_word">great nation</span> we have the parable passing into its interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-7.htm">Ezekiel 31:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a></div><div class="verse">The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cedars in the garden of God</span>. As in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, the thoughts of the prophet dwell on the picture of Eden in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>. Far above all other trees, the cedar of Assyria rose high in majesty. All the trees that were in the garden of God <span class="accented">envied him</span>. The trees specially chosen for comparison are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="cmt_word">fir tress</span> - probably, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>, the cypresses; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="cmt_word">chestnut trees</span>, for which the Revised Version, following the Vulgate and the LXX. of <a href="../../par/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30</a>:97, gives the "plane," which held a high place in the admiration of Greek and Roman writers. Of this we have a special instance in the story of Xerxes, who decorated a plane tree near the Meander with ornaments of gold (Herod., 7:31; 'AElicon,' 5:14; also comp. Ecclus. 24:14; Virg., 'Georg.,' 4:146; Cicero, 'De Ont.,' 1:7, 28). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a></div><div class="verse">I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that <i>were</i> in the garden of God, envied him.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast lifted up thyself</span>. The second and third persons are curiously mixed; probably the former was in the nature of a warning addressed to the King of Egypt, while the latter continues the parable of the history of Assyria. For <span class="cmt_word">boughs</span> read <span class="accented">clouds</span>, as in Ver. 3. Ezekiel writes as with the feeling which led Solon to note that the loftiest trees are those which are most exposed to the strokes of the thunderbolts of Zeus (Herod., 7:10). The Assyrian's heart was "lifted up with pride" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>), and therefore he was delivered to the <span class="cmt_word">mighty one of the nations</span>; sc. to Nebuchadnezzar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-11.htm">Ezekiel 31:11</a></div><div class="verse">I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a></div><div class="verse">And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strangers, the terrible of the nations</span>. We note the recurrence of the phrase of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-11.htm">Ezekiel 30:11</a>, as pointing, here as there, to the Chaldean invaders. The branches of the tree were broken, the people of the earth no longer dwelt under its shadow (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-13.htm">Ezekiel 31:13</a></div><div class="verse">Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon his ruin</span>. The prophet, as it were, corrects his imagery. The birds and beasts are still there, but instead of dwelling in the boughs, they (vultures and owls, jackals and hyenas) hover and creep as over the carcass of the dead, decaying trunk. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a></div><div class="verse">To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the end that none</span>, etc. With a characteristic amplitude of style, Ezekiel preaches the great lesson of the mutability of earthly greatness. This was the lesson that the history of Assyria ought to have taught the nations of the earth, and it was just that lesson that they refused to learn. <span class="cmt_word">They are all delivered to death</span>. The scenery  of the parable passes from Eden to Sheol, the Hades of the nations, and the prophet gives the first stroke of the imagery afterwards more fully developed in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I covered the deep for him</span>. The face of the whole world of nature is painted by the prophet as sharing in the awe and terror of that tremendous fail Lebanon was made to <span class="cmt_word">mourn</span> (literally, to be <span class="accented">black</span>), the waters failed in their channels, the trees (all that drink water) shuddered. They formed part, as it were, of the pageantry of woe at the funeral of the fallen kingdom. It is as if the prophet felt, in all its intensity, what we have learnt to call the sympathy of nature with the sorrows of humanity. It would, perhaps, be over-literal to press details; but the picture, in one of its features at least, suggests a failure of the inundation of the Nile, like that indicated in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-12.htm">Ezekiel 30:12</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a></div><div class="verse">I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be comforted</span>, etc. The Dante-like imagination of the prophet points the contrasts between the impression made by the fall of Assyria on the nations that yet survived, and on those that had already perished. The former mourn and shako with fear, for it is a warning to them that their turn also may come. On the other hand, <span class="cmt_word">the tress of Eden</span> - the great monarchies that are already in Sheol - shall he "comforted" with the thought that yet another kingdom mightier than they has fallen as they fell (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4-20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a>, where the thought is elaborately expanded). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-17.htm">Ezekiel 31:17</a></div><div class="verse">They also went down into hell with him unto <i>them that be</i> slain with the sword; and <i>they that were</i> his arm, <i>that</i> dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that were his arm</span>. The words point to the allies, in the first instance of Assyria, and secondly of Egypt. The last words of the verse present a striking parallel to <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a></div><div class="verse">To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with <i>them that be</i> slain by the sword. This <i>is</i> Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom art thou thus like</span>, etc.? As in Ver. 10, the prophet passes from the past to the present, from the third person to the second, and as it were says to Hophra, "Thou art the man! all that I have said of Assyria is true of thee." <span class="cmt_word">This is Pharaoh</span> <span class="cmt_word">and all his multitude. In the midst of thin uncircumcised</span> (see note on Ezekiel 28:10). As a matter of fact, the Egyptians practiced circumcision, and Ezekiel must be thought of as using the term as simply an epithet of scorn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/30.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 30"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 30" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/32.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 32"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 32" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
