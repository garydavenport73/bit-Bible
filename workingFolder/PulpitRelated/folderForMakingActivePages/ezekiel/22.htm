That connection is, indeed, sufficiently indicated by the recurrence of the formula, "Wilt thou judge?" (see note on Ezekiel 20:4). In obedience to the commands which that question implied, Ezekiel has once more to go through the catalogue of the sins of Judah and Jerusalem. It is not without significance that he applies the very epithet of <span class="cmt_word">bloody city</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">oily of bloods</span>) which Nahum (<a href="../../par/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>) had applied to Nineveh.

The people had made no effort to avert their doom by repentance. They had, as it were, rushed upon their appointed fate. So, though in another sense, the righteous lives of the faithful are said, in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>, to "hasten the coming of the day of God." Exceptional evil and exceptional good alike hasten the approach of the day which is to decide between the two.

The last words point to another form of punishment. Jerusalem is described as in a state of moral tumult and disorder as the consequence of its guilt (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-23.htm">Deuteronomy 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-13.htm">Zechariah 14:13</a>, where the same word is rendered by "tumults" and "destruction").

The fifth commandment was trampled underfoot as well as the sixth, and the blessing of continued national existence (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) was thereby forfeited. The widow and the orphan and the stranger (we note in that last word the width of Ezekiel's sympathies) were oppressed (compare the same grouping in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-16.htm">Deuteronomy 27:16, 19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-8.htm">Ezekiel 22:8</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine holy things</span>, etc. The words take in the whole range of Divine ordinances as affecting both things and persons. (For "profaning sabbaths," see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-16.htm">Ezekiel 20:16</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a></div><div class="verse">In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Men that carry tales</span>, etc. Hebrew, <span class="accented">men of slanders</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-16.htm">Leviticus 19:16</a>). The sin of the informers, ever ready to lend themselves to plots against the life or character of the innocent, was then, as at all times, the besetting evil of corrupt government in the East. Compare the story of Naboth (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>) and of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>). (<span class="cmt_word">For eating on the mountains</span>, see note on Ezekiel 18:6; and for lewdness, that on Ezekiel 16:43.) What the lewdness consisted in is stated in the following verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - This, well-nigh the vilest of all  forms of incest, against which the horror <span class="accented">naturalis</span> of the heathen, as in the story of Hippolytus, uttered its protest, would seem to have been common among the corruptions of Israel (<a href="../../par/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>). (For the sin described in the second clause, see notes on Ezekiel 18:6.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a></div><div class="verse">And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11 ,12.</span> - The list of sins follows on the lines of <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9, 15</a>. (For those in Ver. 12, see notes on Ezekiel 18:12.) It is to be remarked, however, that the prophet does not confine himself to the mere enumeration of specific sins. These are traced to their source in that "forgetting God" which was at once the starting-point and the consummation of all forms of evil (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a></div><div class="verse">In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm">

The gesture, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-14.htm">Ezekiel 21:14, 17</a>, was one of indignant, and, as it were, impatient command. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-14.htm">Ezekiel 22:14</a></div><div class="verse">Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee?

The question implies an answer in the negative. Heart would fail and hands wax feeble in the day of the Lord's judgment. The doom of exile and dispersion must come, with all its horrors; but even here, Judah was not, like Ammon to be forgotten (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>). Her punishment was to do its work, and to consume her filthiness out of her. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a></div><div class="verse">And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.</div><div class="comm">

In <a href="../../par/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2, 3</a> we have the same imagery. Baser metals have been mingled with the silver, and must be burnt out, but there is hope, as well as terror, in the parable. Men throw the mixed metals into the smelting-pot in order that the silver may be separated from the dross and come out pure (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). And this was to be the issue of the "fiery trial" through which Jerusalem and its inhabitants were to pass.

The words admit of the rendering, not <span class="accented">shined upon</span>, and this is adopted by Keil. The land is deprived at once of the sunshine and the rain. which are the conditions of fertility. The LXX. gives "not mined upon," and so the two clauses are parallel and state the same fact. So Ewald. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">immunda</span>, and this is followed both by the Authorized Version and the Revised Version (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7</a>).

The prophet's thoughts go back to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-16</a>, from which, in Ver. 28, he actually quotes It is probable that, in the interval, fresh tidings had reached him of the evil work which they were doing at Jerusalem. The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (equivalent to "princes") suggests that they followed a different text, and this is adopted by Keil and Hitzig. <span class="cmt_word">Like a roaring lion</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The word probably points to the loud declamations of the false prophets (compare, as a striking parallel, <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3, 4</a>).

Extremes meet, and in our Lord's time the same result was brought about by an exaggerated scrupulosity about the very things the neglect of which was, in Ezekiel's time, the root of the evils which he condemns. This was true generally, conspicuously true in the case of the sabbath. Its neglect was a crying evil in Ezekiel's time, just as its exaggeration was in the later development of Judaism. Though in itself positive rather than moral, <span class="cmt_word">to hide the eyes</span> from its holiness was, for these to whom the commandment had been given, an act of immorality.
