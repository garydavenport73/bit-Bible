Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are ignored by him, and he starts from a time of misery and shame. It is obvious that the only period which corresponds to this is that of the sojourn of Israel as an oppressed and degraded people in the land of Goshen. He paints, with a Dantesque minuteness, the picture of a child just born, abandoned by its mother and neglected by all others from the very moment of its birth. It lies unwashed and foul to look upon. No woman's care does for it the commonest offices of motherhood. <span class="cmt_word">For to supple</span>, read,  with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">to cleanse.</span> The practice still met with in the East of rubbing the newborn child with salt may have rested partly on sanitary grounds (Jerome, <span class="accented">in loc.</span> Galen, 'De San.,' 1:7), partly on its symbolic meaning (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>). When this was done, the child was wrapt in swaddling clothes (<a href="../../par/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>), but these too were wanting in the picture which Ezekiel draws. The whole scene may have been painted from the life. Such a birth may well have been witnessed during the march of the exiles, when the brutality of their Chaldean drivers allowed no halt, and the child was left to perish of neglect, and the thought may then have flashed across Ezekiel's mind that the pity which he felt for the deserted infant was a faint shadow of that which Jehovah had felt for Israel in the degradation of their heathen bondage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">to the loathing of thy person,</span> read, with the Revised Version<span class="accented">, for that thy person was abhorred.</span>

The marvel of that unlooked for pity is emphasized by the iteration of the word of mercy, <span class="cmt_word">Live</span>. The commentary of the Chaldee Targum is sufficiently curious to be quoted: "And the memory of my covenant with your fathers came into my mind, and I was revealed that I might redeem you, because it was manifest to me that ye were afflicted in your bondage, and I said unto you, 'I will have compassion on you in the blood of circumcision,' and I said unto you, 'I will redeem you by the blood of the Passover'" (Rosenmuller). The thought underlying this strange interpretation is that blood might be the means of life as well as of pollution, and in that thought there is a significance at once poetical and profound, almost, as it were, anticipating the later thoughts that the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>), that we make our robes white in the blood of the Lamb (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). There is no reason, however, for believing that such thoughts were present to the prophet's mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: <i>thy</i> breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou <i>wast</i> naked and bare.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The tenses should be in the simple historic past: <span class="cmt_word">I caused; thou didst increase and wax great; thou attainedst,</span> and so on (Revised Version). In the word "multiply" (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>) the figure passes into historical reality. <span class="cmt_word">To excellent ornaments</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">to ornament of ornaments.</span> The word is commonly used of jewels, trinkets, and the like (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-4.htm">Exodus 33:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>). So Vulgate, <span class="accented">mundus muliebris.</span> Here, however, the external adorning comes in vers. 10, 11, and instead of the plural we have the dual. Hitzig is, perhaps, right in taking the phrase to refer to tide beauty of the cheeks, which are themselves the ornaments of the golden prime of wroth. The LXX., following either a different reading or paraphrasing, gives, "to cities of cities." The two clauses that fellow point to the most obvious signs of female puberty. For <span class="cmt_word">whereas,</span> read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">yet</span>, etc., as describing, not as the Authorized Version seems to do, a state which trod passed away, but one which still continued even when full-grown girlhood would have demanded clothing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time <i>was</i> the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The words point to the time of the love of the espousals of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>, interpreting the parable, when Israel had grown to the maturity of a nation's life, and gave promise, in spite of previous degradation, of capacities that would render it worthy of the love of the Divine Bridegroom. <span class="cmt_word">I spread my skirt over thee.</span> Garments were often used as coverlets, and the act described was therefore, as in <a href="../../par/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>, the received symbol of a completed marriage (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>). The historical fact represented by the symbol here was probably the formal covenant between Jehovah and Israel (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6, 7</a>). It was then that he became her God, and that she became his people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The "washing" and "anointing" were part of the customary preparations for the marriage union (<a href="../../par/ruth/3-3.htm">Ruth 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>; Judith 10:3). The mention of blood receives its explanation, not in the facts of ver. 6, but in the ceremonial rules of <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-24</a> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Broidered work</span>; the "raiment of needlework" of <a href="../../par/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>. The word meets us again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>, as among the imports of Tyre from Egypt. Curiously enough, the Hebrew verb (<span class="accented">rakam</span>) has passed through Arabic into tide languages of Western Europe, and we have the Italian <span class="accented">ricamare</span>, the Spanish <span class="accented">recamare</span>, the French <span class="accented">recamer</span>, for" embroidering." <span class="cmt_word">Badgers' skin.</span> Elsewhere in the Old Testament the word is found only in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-5.htm">Exodus 28:5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6, 8, 10</a>, e<span class="accented">t al.</span>). It has been commonly taken as meaning the skin of some animal - badger, dolphin, or porpoise, or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">seal</span>, which was used for sandals. All the older versions, however, take it as a word of colour, the LXX. giving <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("dark red"); Aquila, Symmachus, and Vulgate, <span class="accented">ianthino</span> ("violet"). Possibly the two meanings may coalesce, one giving the material, the other the tint which met the eye. <span class="cmt_word">Fine linen.</span> The byssus of Egyptian manufacture (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-3.htm">Exodus 39:3</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Silk</span>. The Hebrew word (here and in ver. 13) does  not occur elsewhere. The word so translated in <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a> is that which we find here and elsewhere for "fine linen." Silk, in the strict sense of the term, had its birthplace in China, and there is no evidence that even the commerce of Tyre extended so far; but the context points to some fine texture of the lawn or muslin kind, like the Coan vestments of the Greeks. So the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, as though it were made of fine hair; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">subtilia.</span> It is significant that three out of the four articles specified are prominent (as the references show) in the description of the tabernacle and the priestly dress, in <a href="../../par/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 39</a>. The dress of the bride symbolized the ritual and cultus of Judaism. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ornaments</span>. Same word as in ver. 7, but here taken in its more usual sense. (For bracelets, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>.

Jerome, however, notes (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that the Syrian women of his time wore pendants or lockets that hung from the forehead to the nostrils. The crown, or diadem (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), the thin circlet of gold confining the hair, completed the catalogue of ornaments. The Chaldee Targum continues its spiritual interpretation: "I gave the ark of my covenant to be among you, and the cloud of my glory overshadowed you, and the angel of my presence led you in the way." And, if we assume, as we legitimately may assume, that Ezekiel, above all others, the prophet of symbolism, did not fill up his picture with details which were only meant to fill it up, this seems a not unfitting interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment <i>was of</i> fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil</span>. From the dress of the bride we pass to her luxuries in the way of food. The things named might, of course, be only chosen as the delicacies for which the land of Israel was famous (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13, 14</a>), which in the prophet's own time were in demand in the markets of Tyre (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>). Cakes of flour and honey were in common use in various forms of Greek ritual, and are probably referred to in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, but in that of the Jews (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>) honey takes its place, side by side with leaven, as a thing forbidden. <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst grow into a kingdom.</span> History crops out through the parable, and points to the stage which it has now reached, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of the magnificence of the kingdom under Solomon.

The prophet, in the words, <span class="cmt_word">my</span> <span class="cmt_word">comeliness -</span> <span class="accented">majesty </span>(Revised Version) - lays stress on the fact that that "perfection" was itself the gift of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15</a></div><div class="verse">But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - We enter on the history of the apostasy, and the root evil was that the bride of Jehovah had been unfaithful to her Lord. She looked on her glory as her own, and did not recognize that everything in it was the gift of God (<a href="../../par/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>). The words obviously point to the policy which Solomon had initiated, of alliances with the heathen and the consequent adoption of their worship. This, as from the earliest days of Israel, was the "whoredom" (Revised Version) of the unfaithful with (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1, 2</a>). And it was, so to speak, a promiscuous whoredom. Every passer by was admitted to her embraces, every nation that offered its alliance had its worship recognized and adopted. In the closing words of extremest scorn, the prophet adds, his it was. Jerusalem was, as I have said, the Messalina of the nations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a></div><div class="verse">And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: <i>the like things</i> shall not come, neither shall it be <i>so</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - (For <span class="cmt_word">high places</span>, see note on Ezekiel 6:6.) The words imply that the shrines upon them were decked with hangings of many coloured tapestry, presenting an appearance like that of a Persian carpet, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>, of the image of the Asherah. Those hangings were, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>, the ornaments of the adulterous bed. The "high places" are named first, as the earliest form of idolatry. The like things <span class="cmt_word">shall not come</span>. The words are obscure, and the text probably corrupt. As they stand, they seem to say that the world would never again witness so shameful an apostasy. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicut non est factum neque futurum est</span>; extends the comparison to the past. Possibly, though it is a strain upon the grammar, the words may be rendered, "such things should not come, should not be." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Images of men,</span> etc.; Hebrew, as falling in with the symbolism of the history, "male images."

This, as afterwards in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>, was the crowning aggravation of the guilt. The very gifts of God, designed for his worship, were prostituted to that of his rivals. The "oil" is that of <a href="../../par/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>, perfumed and set apart for sacred uses. The act of covering the idol was, as in ver. 8, the symbol of the marriage union. In the sweet savour  we have the familiar phrase of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>. The scene brought before us is that of a sacrificial feast, in which cakes of flour, honey, and oil were eaten whilst incense was offered. So we have the "adored liba" of Virgil, 'AEneid,' 7:109, or more fully in Tibullus, 'Eleg.,' 1:7, 53, 54, the "thuria honores," the "liba ... dulcia melle." <span class="cmt_word">Thus it was,</span> etc. As in ver. 16, the description seems to rouse an instinctive abhorrence in the prophet's mind, which finds utterance in this form: "Yes, it was even so." The words are, however, taken by the LXX., Vulgate, and Luther as opening the following verse: "And it came to pass that." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-19.htm">Ezekiel 16:19</a></div><div class="verse">My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, <i>wherewith</i> I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and <i>thus</i> it was, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm">

It will be noticed that the words, "the fire," are in italics, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are not in the Hebrew, the verb "to pass through" having acquired so technical a meaning that it was enough without that addition. This, as the closing words indicate, was the crowning point. As though idolatry in itself was a small matter, it was intensified by infanticide.

Up to this point Ezekiel had dwelt on the forms of idolatry which were indigenous to Canaan and the nations in immediate contact with it.

In the words, <span class="cmt_word">were ashamed of thy lewd way</span>, the prophet points, as his master had done (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>), to the fact that other nations had at least been faithful to their inherited religion, while Judah had forsaken hers.

The culture of the queen of heaven  (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Assyrian Ishtar, may have had this origin. <span class="cmt_word">Yet couldest not be satisfied.</span> One is reminded once more of Juvenal ('Sat.,' 6:130).

Other nations, like Tyre and Zidon, had risen to prosperity and eminence through their intercourse with foreigners. To Judah it had brought only subjection and the payment of tribute. She had given gifts to all her lovers, instead of receiving from them the rewards of her shame. She was as the adulterous wife who forsakes her husband, and gives what belonged to him to strangers. The conduct of Ahaz in stripping the Temple of its gold and silver to pay tribute to Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>), gives an apt illustration of what the prophet means (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>).

For here the forms of punishment were not final The daughter of Zion survived the stoning, the sword, and the burning. And so, when wrath had done its work of retribution, it might become corrective and purgatorial. The injured husband, in the bold anthropomorphic language of the parable, would be no more angry.

Reading between the lines, we find something like an anticipation of St. Paul's thought that Jehovah was the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews (<a href="../../par/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). The Hittites and Sodom and Samaria, to whom she is compared, had all alike been guilty of unfaithfulness to their husbands. Their idolatry was therefore, like hers, an act of apostasy. Jehovah was their husband also, their children were his children (ver. 21). He claimed them as his own, had entered with them also into a relation which, though less close than that with Israel, was as that of the husband to the wife. The thought expands, as we shall see, in the sequel of the chapter.

It was wiser to dwell on the sins which were common to the two cities rather than on the vice which, though it existed in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>), was probably not prevalent there. <span class="cmt_word">As I saw good</span>; better, <span class="accented">according to what I saw.</span> The word "good" is not in the Hebrew, and the words apparently refer to <a href="../../par/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>.

Sodom and Samaria might claim a verdict of acquittal ("justify," in its technical sense) as compared with Judah. They had not  presented, as she had done, a confluence of all the worst idolatries. The words find something like an echo in our Lord's teaching <a href="../../par/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-24.htm">Matthew 11:24</a>. And, as is common m such cases," she had judged," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> had passed sentence of condemnation on those who were more righteous than herself. The Revised Version changes both meaning and punctuation: <span class="accented">Bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters</span>; <span class="accented">through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou</span>; but the Authorized Version seems preferable. It may be questioned whether the word for <span class="cmt_word">judged</span> is ever used of an acquittal. The point of the sentence is that Judah condemned those who were less guilty than herself (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-23</a>).

But all that follows in the chapter shows that what is meant is a promise of restoration, not for Judah only, but also for her less guilty sisters. Ezekiel sees a far off hope for his own nation, and he cannot limit the mercy of God in bringing them also, as she was to be brought, to repentance. For them also punishment was a means to an end beyond itself, corrective, and not merely retributive. The language of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/19-23.htm">Isaiah 19:23</a>-2.5) as to Egypt and Assyria presents a striking parallel, and may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-54.htm">Ezekiel 16:54</a></div><div class="verse">That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - Even in that restoration, however, there should be a further clement of humiliation. Judah should be a <span class="cmt_word">comfort</span> (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>) to those who should see her placed lower than themselves, content, at last, to lake the lowest place, humbling herself that she might be (ver. 61) afterwards exalted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-55.htm">Ezekiel 16:55</a></div><div class="verse">When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - Read <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="cmt_word">when</span>, as in ver. 53.

The most tenable interpretation may be expressed by a paraphrase. The name of Sodom was not in the lips of Judah in the days of her prosperity. It was too vile for utterance, except as a byword of reproach. Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9, 10</a>) had in vain reminded her that she had made herself like them. Her fate could never be like theirs. Now, in the day of the discovery (the uncovering, or laying bare) of her wickedness (ver. 57), she had learnt the lesson. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-57.htm">Ezekiel 16:57</a></div><div class="verse">Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of <i>thy</i> reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all <i>that are</i> round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy reproach</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the reproach.</span> The words point primarily to the disasters, not of Judah, but to those that fell on the cities of Syria and Philistia - the Assyrian and Chaldean invasions. (For the grouping of the two nations as enemies of Judab, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>; and for special acts of hostility, <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>; and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18, 19</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-58.htm">Ezekiel 16:58</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast borne</span>, etc. Judah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, had received the full measure of its punishments. The righteousness of God had been adequately vindicated. And so, if the punishment led to repentances, there was room for pardon (compare for the thought, <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 59, 60.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will even deal with thee,</span> etc. The law of retribution is stated in all its fulness. Falling back upon the idea of the espousals of Israel in the covenant made at Sinai (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11, 12</a>), Ezekiel presses home on Judah the thought that she had broken that covenant. She must suffer as though it no longer existed. She must "dree her weird" and "accept her punishment" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>). And then Jehovah would show that he had not really been unmindful of his part in it. He bad remained faithful in spite of her unfaithfulness. And so in the day of her repentance he will not only renew it, but will give it a higher and more permanent character. The "new covenant" of which Ezekiel's master had spoken (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>) should not be as the old, decaying and vanishing away, but should be foreverlasting. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-60.htm">Ezekiel 16:60</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-61.htm">Ezekiel 16:61</a></div><div class="verse">Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 61.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then thou shalt remember thy ways,</span> etc. The pardon which God gives is not, as men sometimes dream, a water of Lethe, blotting out the memory of the evil past. Ezekiel represents that memory as quickened to a new intensity in the very hour of restoration. The shame which it brings with it is necessary as the safeguard of the new blessedness. <span class="cmt_word">Thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger.</span> It is significant that, as in the Revised Version, both the adjectives are now in the plural. What was possible for Sodom and Samaria was possible also, as for the cities more immediately connected with them, so also for other nations of the heathen world. They to should be admitted into fellowship, not now as alters, but as <span class="cmt_word">daughters</span>, acknowledging, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, her superiority. The limitation which follows, <span class="cmt_word">not by thy covenant,</span> asserts, as it were, the restored prerogative of Judah, much as St. Paul asserts it in <a href="../../par/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>. Those who are within the covenant of Israel, including, as it does, those who are the heirs of the faith of Abraham as well as his children according to the flesh, are in a closer relation to him than others who share in what have been called (the phrase, perhaps, taking its origin from these very words) the "uncovenanted mercies" of God.

Revised Version, <span class="accented">when I have forgiven thee.</span> The Hebrew verb so rendered is that which expresses the fullest idea of forgiveness, and which marked both the "day" and the "sacrifice" of atonement (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-12.htm">Numbers 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). This, according to the received etymology, was represented in the mercy seat, the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, of the ark of the covenant (<span class="accented">cophereth</span>, as from <span class="accented">caphar</span>). So the prophet closes with the wet, Is of an eternal hope what had at first seemed to heal up to nothing but eternal condemnation. How far the prophet expected a literal fulfilment in the restoration of Sodom and Samaria, we cannot define with certainty; but the ideal picture of the purification of the waters of the Dead Sea in ch. 47:8 suggests that it entered into his vision of the future. For us, at least, it is enough to pass from the temporal to the eternal, from the historical to the spiritual, and to see in his words the noblest utterance of mercy prevailing over judgment - a <span class="accented">theodikea</span>, a "vindication of the ways of God to man," like that of <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
