As the territory of Canaan had been originally divided by lot among the twelve tribes after the conquest (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>, etc.), this same method of allocating the soil amongst the new community should be followed on a second time taking possession of it after the exile. Currey believes the phrase, "divide by lot," "does not imply anything like casting lots, but is equivalent to our notion of <span class="accented">allotment</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> several portions being assigned by rule." There is, however, little doubt "lots" were cast to determine, if not the actual size, at least the precise situation, of each tribe's territory (see REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschNumbers 26:54 <span class="commentary">Keil</span> and 'Pulpit Commentary' on Numbers 26:54). That no such methodical distribution of Canaan ever took place, or for that matter could hays taken place amongst the returned exiles, should be proof sufficient that the prophet here moves in the region of the ideal and symbolical rather than of the real and literal. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall offer an oblation</span> -literally, <span class="accented">lift up a heave offering</span> (comp. Ezekiel 44:80; <a href="../../par/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-28.htm">Exodus 29:28</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-12.htm">Leviticus 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord, an holy portion of the land;</span> literally, a <span class="accented">holy</span> (portion) <span class="accented">from the land</span>. Very significantly, in the new partition of Palestine the Lord's portion should be the first to be marked off and solemnly dedicated to Jehovah for the purposes to be forthwith specified. Those who, like Wellhansen and Smend, perceive in this allotment of land to Jehovah, and therefore to the priests, a  contradiction to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a>, omit to notice first that Jehovah required some place on which his sanctuary might be erected, and the priests some ground on which to build houses for themselves; and secondly, that, so far as the priests were concerned, the laud was given by the people, not to them, but to Jehovah, and by him to them (comp. on Ezekiel 44:28). The exact site of this <span class="accented">terumah</span>, or "holy portion," is afterwards indicated (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>); meanwhile its dimensions are recorded. <span class="cmt_word">The length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand</span>. Whether "reeds" or "cubits" should be supplied after "thousand" has divided expositors. Bottcher, Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Smend decide for "cubits," principally on the grounds that "cubits" are mentioned in ver. 2; that "cubits" have been the usual measure hitherto, even (as they contend) in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>; and that otherwise the dimensions of this sacred territory must have been colossal, in fact, out of all proportion to the Holy Land, viz. about 720 square miles (25,000 reeds, or 42.5 miles, &times; 10,000 reeds, or 17 miles,   =   722.5 square miles). Havernick, Keil, <span class="accented">Kliefoth</span>, Currey, and Plumptre favor "reeds," chiefly for the reasons that in ver. 2 "cubits" are specified, and are therefore to be regarded as exceptional; that the customary measuring instrument throughout has been a reed (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>); and that the dimensions, which Ezekiel designed should be colossal (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), correspond exactly with the measurements afterwards given in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>, if these he in reeds, but not if they be in cubits. As to the breadth of this <span class="accented">terumah</span> from east to west, Hitzig, Keil, <span class="accented">Smend</span>, Schroder, and Plumptre follow the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in substituting 20,000 for 10,000, considering that the space referred to in ver. 3 appears as if meant to be taken from an already measured larger area, which could only be that of ver. 1 - the portion in ver. 1 being the whole territory assigned to the priests and Levites, and that in ver. 3 the allotment for the priests. Kliefoth, however, contends that no necessity exists for tampering with the text, and certainly if vers. 1-4 be regarded as descriptive of the priests' portion <span class="accented">only</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> in the phrase, "of this measure" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>), in ver. 8 be rendered "according to" - a sense it may have (see Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>), the supposed difficulty disappears. In this case the demonstrative this in the last clause will refer to the priests' portion exclusively; in the former ease, to the whole portion of the priests and Levites. That <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a> declares the Levites' portion to be "holy unto the land" does not prove it must have been included in the holy <span class="accented">terumah</span> of ver. 1 Nor does this concession follow, as will appear, from ver. 7. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a></div><div class="verse">Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred <i>in length</i>, with five hundred <i>in breadth</i>, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of this district</span>, either of 25,000 &times; 10,000, or 25,000 &times; 20,000 reeds, according to the view taken of ver. 1, there should be measured off for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth. The supplement here also, <span class="accented">Keil</span>, Kliefoth, Plumptre, and others consider to be "reeds," since obviously the whole temple with its precincts is intended (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>), though Hengstenberg and Schroder prefer "cubits," holding the sanctuary to be the temple buildings enclosed within the outer court well (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>.). The free space of <span class="cmt_word">fifty cubits round about for the suburbs</span> (or, <span class="accented">open places</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thereof</span> seems to indicate that the larger area was that alluded to by the prophet. That the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. occurs more frequently in the so-called priest-code (Leviticus 25:84; <a href="../../par/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2, 3, 4, 5, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2, 3, 8, 11, 13</a>, etc.) and in the Chronicles (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-14.htm">2 Chronicles 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-19.htm">2 Chronicles 31:19</a>) than in Ezekiel (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15, 17</a>) is a fact; but on this fact cannot be founded an argument for the priority of Ezekiel, since it rather points to Ezekiel's acquaintance with such "suburbs" in connection with priestly and Levitical cities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a></div><div class="verse">And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary <i>and</i> the most holy <i>place</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And of this measure shalt thou measure</span>.

The exact position of the sanctuary in the <span class="accented">priests</span>' portion is afterwards stated to have been in the midst (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a></div><div class="verse">The holy <i>portion</i> of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The holy portion of the land just defined</span> (ver. 3) should be reserved <span class="cmt_word">for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the inner court, who were privileged to draw near to Jehovah in altar ministrations (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5, 40</a>), as distinguished from the Levites, who were only" ministry of the house" (ver. 5), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> guardian, of the temple and assistants in its outer court services. As such this holy portion should serve the twofold purpose of providing- for the priests <span class="cmt_word">a place for their houses</span> in which they might dwell, and <span class="cmt_word">an holy place for the sanctuary</span>, in which they should minister.

Kliefoth and Curroy retain the word "chambers "as in the text, and think the "chambers" and the "land" were two distinct possessions of the Levites, the chambers having been within (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17, 18</a>) as the land was without the sanctuary. Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick, Hengstenberg, and Schroder decide for "chambers," or "courts," rows of dwellings standing outside the sanctuary as the priests' chambers were located within. Havernick supposes that along with these, which were obviously designed to be employed when the Levites were on duty, there may have been other Levitical towns and dwellings, Hengstenberg conceives them as having been "barracks for the Levites, the inhabitants of which used the twentieth part of the land assigned to them as pasturage." Unfavorable to the first view is the fact that it requires the text to be altered. Against the second is its awkward dividing of the verse and unexpected interjection of a reference to cells within the sanctuary while speaking of the land without. The third, while not free from difficulty as taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> to be equivalent to "cell-buildings," is perhaps the best. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a></div><div class="verse">And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy <i>portion</i>: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - In addition to the holy terumah for the priests and the portion for the Levites, should be marked off as <span class="cmt_word">the possession of the city</span> a third tract of territory, <span class="cmt_word">five thousand</span> (reeds) <span class="cmt_word">broad, and five and twenty thousand long</span>, <span class="cmt_word">over against</span> - rather, <span class="accented">side by side with</span> (Revised Version), "parallel to" (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">the oblation of the holy portion</span>. That is to say, it should lie upon the south, as the Levites' territory lay upon the north of the priests' portion. Adding the 10,000 reeds of breadth for the Levites' domain, the 10,000 for the priests' land, and the 5000 for the city quarter, makes a total breadth of 25,000 reeds; so that the tract in which all these were included was a square. That the portion for the city should be <span class="cmt_word">for the whole house of Israel</span> implied that it should be communal property, belonging to no tribe in particular, but to all the tribes together - in modern phrase should be "common good, <span class="accented">ein</span> <span class="accented">Volksgut</span> (Kliefoth), which should neither be confiscated by kingly rapacity (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>) nor invaded by individual and private appropriation, but retained for the use of the inhabitants generally (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-18.htm">Ezekiel 48:18, 19</a>).

That Israel in former times had suffered from the oppressions and exactions of her kings, from Solomon downwards, as Samuel had predicted she would (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>), was matter of history (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4, 10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>), and was perhaps partly explained, though not justified, by the fact that the kings had no crown lands assigned them for their support. This excuse, however, for regal tyranny should in future cease, as a sufficient portion of land should be allocated to the prince and his successors, who accordingly should <span class="cmt_word">give</span>, or <span class="accented">leave</span>, the rest of the <span class="cmt_word">land to the house of Israel according to their tribes</span>. The use of "princes" does not show, as Hengstenberg asserts, that "under the ideal unity of the prince in Ezekiel, a numerical plurality is included," and that "these who understand by the prince merely the Messiah must here do violence to the text;" but simply, as Kliefoth explains, that Ezekiel was thinking of Israel's past kings, and contrasting with them the rulers Israel might have in the future, without affirming that these should be many or one (see on Ezekiel 44:3).

The "gerah," value two pence, was the smallest silver coin; the "shekel," therefore, was forty pence, or 3s. 4d. Commentators are divided as to how the second half of this verse should be understood: <span class="cmt_word">twenty shekel, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.</span> The "maneh" (or "portion," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to be divided"), which occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>; and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-71.htm">Nehemiah 7:71, 72</a> - "that is to say, only in books written during the Captivity or subsequent to it" (Keil) - was probably the same coin as the Greek rains (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span>), though its weight may have somewhat differed. A comparison of <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a> with <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a> shows that a maneh was equal to a hundred shekels, which cannot be made to harmonize with the statement in this verse without supposing either that an error has crept in through transcription, or that the chronicler has employed the late Greek style of reckoning, in which one mina is equivalent to a hundred drachmas. Again, the Hebrew and Attic talents, when ex-stained, fail to solve the problem as to how the text should be rendered. The Hebrew talent, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, contained 3000 sacred or Mosaic shekels according to <a href="../../par/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; and the Attic talon 60 minas, each of 100 drachmas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 6000 drachmas, or 3000 drachmas, each of which again was equal to a Hebrew shekel. Hence the Attic mina must have been one-sixtieth part of 3000, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 50 shekels, which once more fails to correspond with Ezekiel's notation. What this notation is depends on how the clauses should be connected. If with "and," <span class="accented">as</span> Ewald, following the Targumists, thinks, Ezekiel is supposed to have ordained that in the future the maneh should be, not 50, but 60 (20 + 25 -1- 15) shekels - the weight of the 'Babylonian <span class="accented">mana</span> ('Records of the Past,' 4:97, second series); only, if he so intended, one sees not why he should have adopted this roundabout method of expression instead of simply stating that henceforth the maneh should be sixty shekels If with "or," as Michaelis, Gesenius, Hitzig, and Hengstenberg prefer, then the prophet is regarded as asserting that in the future three manehs of varying values should be current - one of gold, another of silver, and a third of copper (Hitzig), or all of the same metal, but of different magnitudes (Michaelis); and this arrangement might well have been appointed for the future, although no historical trace can be found of any such manehs of twenty, twenty-five, and fifteen shekels respectively having been in circulation either <span class="accented">among</span> the Hebrews or among foreign peoples. Kliefoth pronounces both solutions unsatisfactory, but has nothing better to offer. Keil supposes a corruption of the text of old standing, for the correction of which we are as yet without materials. Bertheau and Havernick follow the LXX. (Cod.

Thus the demands of Ezekiel's Torah surpass those of the earlier or Mosaic Torah in quantity as well as quality. That these demands are definitely specified does not prove they should partake rather of the nature of a tax than of a free-will offering. That they were not to be regarded as taxes is shown by the absence of any allusion to penalties for neglect of payment; that they were designed to be looked upon as free-will offerings is plain from the circumstance that Jehovah never supposes for a moment that these generous offerings will be withheld; and perhaps all that is really signified by them is that the liberality of Jehovah's people in the future age should greatly exceed that which had been practiced at any former time.

Whether three festivals are referred to or only two is debated by expositors. Fairbairn, Havernick, Ewald, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre decide for three - the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20), the Passover (vers. 21-24), and the Feast of Tabernacles (ver. 25). Kliefoth, Smend, and Curtsy find only two a Passover and a Feast of Tabernacles. Hengstenberg sees in the solemnities of the first and seventh days of the new year a special consecration service for the new temple, not to be repeated, corresponding to the dedication of the tabernacle on the first day of the first month (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-1.htm">Exodus 40:1, 17</a>), or of the Solomonic temple in the seventh month (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>),  and in imitation of which the post-exilic temple was dedicated, probably on the first day of the year (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-22</a>). Against the notion of a special dedication service, however, stand the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the temple had been already consecrated by the entrance into it of the glory of the Lord (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the service here described differs in respect either of time or ritual or both from every one of the three cited dedications. Between the two other views the difference is slight. If the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20) was distinct from the Passover, it was still, by the ritual of the seventh and fourteenth days of the first month (vers. 20, 22), so closely connected with the Passover as practically to form a preparation for and introduction to it. Then the circumstance that the proper ceremonial for the new moon is afterwards described (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a>) favors the proposal to regard the rites in vers. 18-20 as a part of the Passover festival; while this view, if adopted, will explain the omission from ver. 25 of all mention of the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1</a>), and of the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>), with which the autumn festival was usually preceded, by showing that in lieu of these a sacrificial observance had been prefixed to the Passover on the first and seventh days of the first month. Smend's theory, that "Ezekiel's feast-calendar divides the ecclesiastical year into two halves, each of which begins with a re. conciliation ceremony (or expiatory sacrifice) on the first days of the first and seventh months respectively," would lend confirmation to the above view, were it not that the theory in question is based on an alteration of the text in ver. 20 (see Exposition). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God.</span> The usual solemn introduction prefixed to Divine enactments (comp. ver. 9; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-6.htm">Ezekiel 44:6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the first month, in the first day of the month</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/8-13.htm">Genesis 8:13</a>).

Under the Mosaic Torah, the Passover began on the tenth day of the first month by the selection of a lamb (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>), corresponding to which the great Day of Atonement in the seventh month fell upon the tenth day (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>). In the Torah of Ezekiel, the ceremonies introducing and leading up to the Passover should begin with the first day of the month, as under the Law the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh mouth practically began the solemnities which culminated in the Feast of Tabernacles. <span class="cmt_word">A young bullock without blemish</span> should form the sacrificial offering on this first day of the year, according to the ordinance published by Ezekiel; that promulgated by the Hebrew lawgiver appointed for new moons generally, in addition to the burnt and meat offerings, a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15</a>), and particularly for the first day of the seventh month, in addition to the regular burnt and meat offerings, one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs for a burnt offering, meat offerings of flour and oil for each of these animals, and a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). The object for which the Mosaic offerings were presented was to make atonement for the worshippers; the Ezekelian sacrifices should stand in more immediate relation to the place of worship, and be designed to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse the sanctuary</span> from such defilement, to be afterwards mentioned, as might be contracted from the presence in it of erring men (ver. 20).

Though the selection of the lamb upon the tenth day of the first month is not specified, it may be assumed that this would be implied in the appointment of a Passover which should begin on the day already legalized by the Mosaic Torah. According to Wellhausen and Smend, the first mention of the Passover occurs in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2, 5, 6</a>, and the next in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>; but this can only be maintained by declaring <a href="../../par/exodus/34-25.htm">Exodus 34:25</a>, which occurs in the so-called "Book of the Covenant" - a pre-Deuteronomic work - "a gloss," and by relegating <a href="../../par/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. to the "priest-code" for no other reason than that it alludes to the Passover (vers. 11, 21, 27, 43) - a principle of easy application, and capable of being used to prove anything. Smend likewise regards it as strange that the Passover should be made to commence on the fourteenth of the month, and not, as the autumn feast, on the fifteenth (ver. 25); and suggests that the original reading, which he supposes was the fifteenth, may have been corrected subsequently in accordance with the priest, code. But if the priest-cede was posterior to and modeled after Ezekiel. Why should it have ordained the fourteenth instead of that which its master recommended, viz. the fifteenth? A sufficient explanation of the differing dates in Ezekiel is supplied if Ezekiel, in fixing them, may be held to have followed the so-called priest-cede. <span class="cmt_word">A feast of seven days</span>; <span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">a feast of hebdomad of days</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). By almost all interpreters this is understood to mean "a feast of a full week, the exact duration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which began with the eating of the Paschal lamb (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8, 15-20</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/9-11.htm">Numbers 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3, 4</a>). At the same time, it is frankly admitted that, to extract this sense from the words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> must be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. As the words stand, they can only signify a feast of weeks of days. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, in <a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>, is applied to the Feast of Pentecost, which was called "a Feast of <span class="accented">Hebdomads</span>," from the seven weeks which intervened between the Passover and it. Hence Kliefoth, adhering to the legitimate sense of the expression, understands the prophet to say that the whole period of seven weeks between the first Passover and Pentecost should be celebrated in the new dispensation as a Feast of Unleavened Bread. In support of this Kliefoth cites a similar use of the word "days" in <a href="../../par/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2, 3</a>; and certainly no objection can be taken to a Passover of seven weeks, if Ezekiel may be supposed to have been merely expressing analogically spiritual conceptions, and not furnishing actual legislation to be afterwards put in operation. Against this translation, however, Keil urges that the expression, "seven days of the feast" (ver. 23), appears to mark the duration of the festival; but this is not so convincing as its author imagines, since the prophet may be held as describing, in vers. 23, 24, the procedure of each seven days without intending to unsay what he had already stated, that the feast should continue seven weeks of days. A second objection pressed by Keil, that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> "is not usually connected with the preceding noun in the construct state, but is attached as an adverbial accusative," as in the above-cited passages, is sufficiently disposed of by Kliefoth's statement that the punctuation might easily be altered so as to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. Upon the whole, while not free from difficulty, the view of Kliefoth seems best supported by argument.

In, the first place, the "sin offering" here prescribed was manifestly to take precedence of the Paschal feast proper, whereas in the Paschal festival of the so-called priest-code the daffy sacrifices were appointed to begin  on the fifteenth after the Paschal lamb had been slain and eaten (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-8.htm">Leviticus 23:8</a>). In the second place, the sin offering was to consist of a bullock instead of a he-goat as formerly (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-22.htm">Numbers 28:22</a>). In the third place, it was not intended to be renewed on each of the seven following days of the feast, but was designed, by repeating the sacrifice of the first and seventh days, to connect these with the fourteenth, on which the feast proper opened.

That is, the same sacrifices should be offered daily throughout the seven days of this feast as had been offered during the seven days of the former feast. That this feast was designed to represent the ancient Feast of Tabernacles can scarcely be doubted, though the practice of living in booths (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40-43</a>) is not adverted to. Possibly this may have been omitted, as Keil remarks, "because the practice of living in booths would be dropped in the time to come" (see, however, <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14-17</a>), or, as Kliefoth observes, "because, when Ezekiel's Torah should come into operation, the people of God would be dwelling in the eternal tabernacles of which the booths of the Mosaic Torah were but the types." Nor are the deviations of Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, in respect of the daily offerings prescribed for this feast, fewer or of less importance than those which have been noted in connection with the Passover. Ezekiel's Torah prescribes for a burnt offering seven bullocks and seven rams daily, for a sin offering a he-goat daily, for a meat offering an ephah of flour with a hin of oil for each bullock and each ram daily; the Mosaic Torah, while retaining the he goat for a sin offering, required - for a burnt offering on the first day thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs, and so on, diminishing by one bullock each day, till the seventh, when seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs should be sacrificed; and for a meal offering three-tenths of an ephah of flour for every bullock, and two-tenths of an ephah for every ram, and one-tenth of an ephah for each lamb, according to the number of bullocks, rams, and lambs for each day. In addition, the Mosaic celebration concluded with a solemn assembly with special sacrifices on the eighth day (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-39</a>), of which no mention is made in Ezekiel. Nor should it be overlooked that Ezekiel's Torah omits all reference to the other great festival that figures in the Mosaic Torah, viz. that of Pentecost, or the Feast of Weeks, as well as to the Feast of Trumpets and the great Day of Atonement (see on ver. 21), although Hengstenberg is of opinion that Ezekiel, having instanced the Passover and Tabernacles, the beginning and end of the feast-cycle already known to the Jews, designed that all the feasts which lay between should be included. Be this, however, as it may, to infer from the deviations in Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, as George, Vatke, Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, Robertson Smith, Cornill, and Driver have done, that the latter had no existence in the time of Ezekiel is, as Havernick observes, not only to render Ezekiel's representations completely unintelligible, but to beg the entire question between the newer criticism and the old faith. "How will one generally explain," asks Cornill ('Einleitung in das Alte Testament,' p. 64), "that a Jerusalem priest sets up a Torah for the future, which completely ignores the priest code (?), in all points remains far behind its requirements (?), and in a groping manner lays hold of the future, instead of appropriating to himself the finished system (i.e. of the, so-called priest code, supposing it to have then existed)? Why does Ezekiel require, in the cultus (which he sets up) so much less than <a href="../../par/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, and 29.? Where, in Ezekiel is the high priest, who for the priest code is the center of the theocracy? Where is the great Day of Atonement of <a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.?" and so on. The answer to these interrogations is that Ezekiel did not intend to republish the Mosaic Torah, but to modify it so as to meet the requirements of the new era, or (perhaps better) to express more adequately the new conceptions of religion and worship he had been commissioned to set before his fellow-exiles; and that Ezekiel had a perfect right to deal in this way even with the Mosaic Torah, inasmuch as he distinctly claimed, in committing to writing the details of his temple- vision, to be acting under special Divine guidance (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>). Canon Driver ('An Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 133) admits that the argument from Ezekiel's deviations from the so-called priest-code in favor of the later origin of the latter, if "taken by itself, would not, perhaps, be a decisive one," and even adds that, "however doubtful it may be whether Ezekiel presupposes the <span class="accented">completed</span> priests' code, it is difficult not to conclude that he presupposes <span class="accented">parts</span> of it" ibid., p. 138). But if none of it existed before Ezekiel, then a counter-question to that of Cornill may be put, "How is it to be explained that the unknown author of the priests' code should have allowed himself to deviate so far from the arrangements which Ezekiel, a prophet acting under Jehovah's guidance, had established?" The natural reply is that when the priests' code was composed, Ezekiel's Torah did not exist. If the newer criticism believes that Ezekiel would not have deviated so largely as he has done from the rites prescribed in the priests' code had these been in operation and invested with authority (see 'Drivel', 'An Introduction,' etc., p. 133), the newer criticism should explain how the priests' code came to deviate from the Torah of Ezekiel, which, if it was not then in actual operation, was at least invested with Divine authority. Is it not every way as logical to infer, from the deviations of the priests' code (supposing it to be post-exilic) from the Torah of Ezekiel, that the author of the priests' code could not have known of the existence of Ezekiel's Torah, and therefore that it could not then have been in existence, as <span class="accented">vice versa</span> that Ezekiel had no acquaintance with the priests' code, and that therefore it had not in his day been composed? The impartial reasoner, with no theory to uphold, will recognize that the two arguments run exactly purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/44.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 44"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 44" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/46.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 46"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 46" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
