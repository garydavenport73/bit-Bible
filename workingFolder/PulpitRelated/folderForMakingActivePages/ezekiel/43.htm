The statement that <span class="cmt_word">the earth shined with his glory</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a>) has by Havernick, Kliefoth, and others been supposed to indicate the absence of that "cloud" in which the glory of Jehovah appeared in both the Mosaic tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34, 35</a>) and the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a>), and thereby to point to the clearer and more resplendent manifestations of the Godhead, which were to be given in connection with the new dispensation for which Ezekiel's "house" was being prepared. This, however, as Keil has shown, cannot be main-rained in face of the facts that in both Exodus and 1 Kings "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord"</span> is used synonymously with "the cloud," and that in Ezekiel's vision "the glory" and "the cloud" were alike present (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3, 4</a>). Kliefoth and Schroder hold "the earth" which was illumined to have been "the whole globe," "the entire region of humanity," as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, etc.; but there does not appear ground for departing from the ordinary sense of the words, that "the path" of the advancing God was irradiated by the brilliance of his material glory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>it was</i> according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, <i>even</i> according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions <i>were</i> like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The prophet identifies the vision on which he now looks as the same he had formerly beheld on the hanks of the Chebar, when he <span class="cmt_word">came to destroy the city</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when, in obedience to Divine command, he stood forth to announce the destruction of Jerusalem. Ewald and Smend follow the Vulgate. <span class="accented">quando venit ut disperderet</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> substituting "he," Jehovah, for "I," Ezekiel; but the change is unnecessary, as the prophet's language is perfectly intelligible and quite correct, since "the prophet destroyed the city ideally by his prophecy" (Hitzig), and it is not unusual for Scripture to represent a prophet as himself doing what he is only sent to predict (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). The prophet's reason for introducing this clause was manifestly the same he had for identifying the visions - to show that, while it was the same Jehovah who had departed from the old temple that was now returning to the new, there was nothing incongruous in the idea that he who in the past had shown himself a God of justice and judgment by overturning and destroying the old, should in the future exhibit himself as a God of grace and mercy by condescending to establish his abode in the new. The impression produced upon the prophet's soul by his vision was the same that had been produced by the <span class="accented">former - he fell upon his face</span> in awe and wonder.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard <i>him</i> speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard him</span> (better, one) <span class="cmt_word">speaking unto me out of the house; and the</span> (literally, a) <span class="cmt_word">man stood by me</span>. Two questions arise - Who was the speaker? and, Who the man? As <span class="accented">to the speaker</span>, the natural reply is that the One who addressed Ezekiel from the interior of the "house" was Jehovah himself, whose "glory" had just entered in to take possession of the house, and this view is adopted by most interpreters, though Hengstenberg and Schroder regard the man who stood beside the prophet as the one who addressed him. As to <span class="accented">the man</span>, it cannot, as Kliefoth maintains, be decided solely by the absence of the article before "man" that this was a different person from the guide who had hitherto conducted the prophet and measured the Building. The article may have Been emitted because the important point to be recorded was not the circumstance that the "one" who stood beside him was his quondam guide, but the fact that this "one" was a man. That he was also Ezekiel's old conductor is at least a natural suggestion when one finds him afterwards appearing as a measurer with a line in his hand (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, <i>neither</i> they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-12.</span> - Debate exists as to who the speaker in the seventh verse was, whether Jehovah or the man - some holding with Kliefoth, Ewald, Smend, and Currey, that he was Jehovah; others, with Havernick, Keil, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, that he was "the man;" and still others, with Plumptre, that it cannot be decided which he was. One thing is clear, that if "the man" was the speaker, his words and message were not his own, but Jehovah's. Yet unless the man had been the angel of the Lord - the view of Hengstenberg and Schroder - it will always seem incongruous that he should have addressed Ezekiel without a "Thus saith the Lord." Hence the notion that the speaker was Jehovah is, perhaps, the one freest from difficulty. The message announced or communication made to the prophet related first to Jehovah's purpose in entering the temple (vers. 7-9), and secondly to his object in showing the house to the prophet, viz. that he might show it to the house of Israel (vers. 10-12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The LXX. and the Vulgate divide the present verse into two parts, and take the first as equivalent to a solemn word of consecration, the former supplying <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> the latter <span class="accented">vidisti</span>, "thou hast seen." The Chaldee Targum inserts, <span class="accented">hic est locus</span>, "this is the place," and in so doing is followed by Luther and the Revised Version. Some word, it is obvious, either a "see!" or a "behold!" must be interpolated, in thought at least, unless one adopts the construction of the Authorized Version, with which Smend agrees, and makes "the place of my throne," etc., to be governed By the verb "defile," or, with Ewald, places it under the regimen of "show" in ver. 10, throwing the whole intervening clause into a long parenthesis  - a device which does not contribute to lucidity. Of the two expressions here employed to designate the sanctuary - not the temple proper, but the whole house with its surroundings - the former, <span class="cmt_word">the place of my throne</span>, though peculiar to Ezekiel, receives explanation from the conception, familiar to earlier writers, of Jehovah as dwelling between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>); the latter, <span class="cmt_word">the place of the soles of my feet</span>, was of frequent occurrence to denote the ark of the covenant (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>) and the temple (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>). The word of consecration was expressed in the promise, <span class="cmt_word">I will dwell</span> (in the temple) <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the children of Israel forever,</span> etc., which went beyond anything that had been spoken concerning either the tabernacle of Moses or the <span class="accented">temple</span> of Solomon (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-13.htm">1 Kings 6:13</a>). The second part of the verse announces what would be the result of Jehovah's perpetual inhabitation of the temple - the house of Israel would no more defile his holy Name either <span class="cmt_word">by their whoredom or by the carcasses of their kings in their high places</span>, or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">in their death</span>. That the whoredom signified idolatry (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>.) commentators are agreed. What divides them is whether this also is alluded to in the alternative clause. Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick, Keil, Fairbairn, and Plumptre believe it is, contending that the "carcasses of their kings" (comp. Leviticus  26:30; and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>) was a contemptuous and satirical designation of the idols they had formerly served, that the word "kings ' is frequently employed in this sense in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>), and that the special sin complained of, that of building altars for dead idols in the very temple court, had been practiced by more kings than one in Judah (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4, 5-7</a>); and in support of this view may be urged first that it is favored by the use of the term <span class="accented">bamotk</span>, or "<span class="accented">high</span> <span class="accented">places</span>," in ver. 7, and secondly by the exposition offered in ver. 8 of the nature of the sin. Ewald, Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Smend, on the other hand, regard the sin spoken of in the second clause as different from that indicated in the first, maintaining that while this was the practice of defiling Jehovah's sanctuary by idolatry that was the desecration of the same by the interment in its courts of their dead kings. Against this, however, stands the fact that no authentic instance can be produced of a Judaean sovereign's corpse having been interred in the temple area. David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, and others were buried in the city of David (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-50.htm">1 Kings 22:50</a>), and a place of sepulchers existed on the south-west comer of Zion in the days of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16</a>); but these prove nothing unless the temple hill be taken, as no doubt it sometimes was, in an extended sense as inclusive of Mount Zion. Similarly, the statement that Manasseh had a burial-place in the garden of Uzzah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18, 26</a>) cannot be adduced in support of this view, unless it can be shown that the garden of Uzzah was situated on the temple hill. On the whole, therefore, the balance of argument inclines in favor of the first view, though it does involve the introduction of a figurative sense into the words. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Ezekiel 43:8</a></div><div class="verse">In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds</span> etc. The first "their" can only refer to "the house of Israel and their kings;" the second "their" may also allude to these, but is best taken as pointing to the "idols," whose thresholds or temples, according to the view adopted of the preceding verse, were set up in the court of Jehovah's temple, and so close to the latter that nothing stood between them except the temple wall Smend, who favors the second view of the preceding verse, considers this verse as a complaint against the kings for having erected their royal residence on Mount Zion, in the immediate vicinity of the temple; but as David's palace was older than the temple, it is not likely Ezekiel was guilty of perverting history in the manner this hypothesis would imply. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-9.htm">Ezekiel 43:9</a></div><div class="verse">Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now let them put away their whoredom</span>, etc. What has just been declared to be the necessary consequence of Jehovah's abiding in the midst of Israel is now enjoined upon Israel as an indispensable prerequisite of Jehovah's taking up his residence amongst them. Ezekiel's theology in this respect harmonizes with that of Old and New Testament writers generally, who invariably postulate purity of heart and life as a necessary condition of God's abiding in the heart, while asserting that such Divine indwelling in the heart is the only certain creator of such purity (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Show</span> (or, <span class="accented">make known</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> publish the revelation concerning) <span class="cmt_word">the house to the house of Israel</span> For this purpose the vision had been imparted to the prophet. <span class="cmt_word">That they may be ashamed of their iniquities</span>.

This explained how, by beholding the house, Israel would be led to repent, and be ashamed of her iniquities. There is no ground for thinking the ultimate object Jehovah had in view, in recommending the house of Israel to note the proportions of the visionary edifice, was, as Wellhausen, Smend, and others allege, that they might reproduce these in the post-exilic building; if they were to measure, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> scan and meditate upon the fair dimensions of the "house," it was that they might understand its religious or moral and spiritual significance, both as a whole and in detail. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a></div><div class="verse">And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write <i>it</i> in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if they be ashamed of all that they have done</span>. This cannot signify that Ezekiel was not to show the house until they had evinced a sincere penitence for past wickedness, since the converse has just been stated, that their repentance should flow from a disclosure to them of the house: but that in the event of the presentation to them of the "well-measured" building awaking in them any disposition of regret and sorrow, then the prophet should proceed to unfold to them its details. He should show them first the form of the house, <span class="accented">i.e. the</span> external shape of the building, and the <span class="cmt_word">fashion thereof</span>, or its well-proportioned and harmonious arrangements; <span class="cmt_word">the goings out thereof,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the comings in thereof</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its exits and entrances (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and all the forms thereof</span>; which can only mean the shapes of its several parts; <span class="cmt_word">and all the ordinances thereof</span>, or regulations concerning its use in worship, <span class="cmt_word">and all the forms thereof</span> - the same words as above, and therefore omitted by the LXX. as well as some Hebrew manuscripts, and, after their example, by Dathe, Hitzig, Ewald, Smend, and others, though Keil, Kliefoth, Schroder, and others retain the clause as genuine, and regard it as an illustration of Ezekiel's habit of crowding words together for the sake of emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">and all the laws thereof</span>, by which were probably signified "the instructions contained in these statutes for sanctification of life" (Keil). In addition to rehearsing the above in the hearing of the people, the prophet was directed to <span class="cmt_word">write them in their sight</span>, if it be not open to understand the "writing" as explanatory of the way in which the" showing" was to be made. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-12.htm">Ezekiel 43:12</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about <i>shall be</i> most holy.

In this instance "the house" must not be restricted to the temple proper, consisting of the holy place and the holy of holies, but extended to the whole free space encompassing the outer court, the quadrangular area of three thousand cubits square (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>); and concerning this house as so defined, the fundamental torah, law, or regulation, is declared to be that of its complete sanctity. Ewald and Smend, as usual, unite with the LXX. in connecting "upon the top of the mountain" with "house;" but expositors generally agree that the clause belong to the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about;</span> and that the prophet's thought is that the entire territory upon the mountain summit included within the above specified border, and not merely the inner sanctuary, or even that with its chambers and courts, was to be regarded as most holy, or as a <span class="accented">holy of holies</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was to be consecrated as the innermost <span class="accented">adytum</span> of the tabernacle and temple had been. by the indwelling of Jehovah. Smend notes that "This is the law" is the customary underwriting and superscription of the laws of the priest-code (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-46.htm">Leviticus 11:46</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/12-7.htm">Leviticus 12:7</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-59.htm">Leviticus 13:59</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-54.htm">Leviticus 14:54</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-32.htm">Leviticus 15:32</a>); but it need not result from this that the priest. code borrowed this expression from Ezekiel, who employs it only in this verse. The more rational hypothesis is that Ezekiel, himself a priest, made use of this formula, because acquainted with it as already existing in the so-called priest-code.

Its dimensions, then omitted, are now reported in connection with its consecration, which also is narrated as a pendant to that of the "house," because of the intimate connection between the two - the consecration of the altar being practically equivalent to the consecration of the house, and the consecration of the house finding approximate expression in the consecration of the altar. As in the other portions of the temple, so in this, the measurements are given <span class="cmt_word">after the cubits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by or in cubits, the length of each cubit being noted at "a cubit and an hand-breadth," as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>.  They are likewise taken first from the foundation upwards (vers. 13-15), and then from the top downwards (vers. 16, 17).

If Smend's feasible notion be not adopted, then probably that of Hitzig, Kliefoth, or Keil most nearly expresses the conception of the Hebrew term. The altar was surrounded by an enclosure in which it seemed to be set, or out of which to rise; the dimensions of this "stand" or "enclosure" being a cubit in height, and a cubit in breadth, with <span class="cmt_word">a border</span> on its edge round about a span or half a cubit high.

(<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>), identify as synonymous, and translate by "hearth." But the first can only signify "the mount of God," while the latter may mean either "lion of God" or "hearth of God." Kliefoth, deriving the latter from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to consume," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5db;</span>, "a ram," prefers as its import "ram-devourer;" Hengstenberg, resolving into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> "a ram," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span>, "a lion," proposes as its equivalent "ram-lion." <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the lion that consumes the rams for God" - a ten-doting closely allied to that of Kliefoth. In any case, the terms allude to parts of the altar: the second, Ariel (equivalent to the hearth on which God's fire burns), according to Keil, Kliefoth, and the best expositors, meaning the flat surface of the altar; and the first, Harel (conveying the ideas of elevation and sanctity), the base on which it rested. The height of this base was four cubits, while from the hearth projected four horns, as in the altars of the Mosaic tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-2.htm">Exodus 38:2</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>) and Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/psalms/118-27.htm">Psalm 118:27</a>). If the length of these be set down, as Kliefoth suggests, at three cubits, then the whole height of the altar will be in cubits - one for the ground bottom, two for the lower settle, four for the upper, four for the bases of the hearth, with three for the horns, equal to fourteen in all; or, omitting the horns, of which the length is not given, and the altar base, which is distinguished from the altar, ten cubits in all for the altar proper. As to the symbolic import of the "horns," Kurtz, after Hofmaun and Kliefoth, finds this in the idea of elevation, the "horns," as the highest point in the altar, bringing the blood put upon them nearer to God than the sides did the blood sprinkled on them (see 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 13); Keil, after Bahr, in the notions of strength, beauty, and blessing, the horns of an animal being the points in which its power, grace, and fullness of life are concentrated, and therefore fitting emblems of those points in the altar in which appears "its significance as a place of the revelation of Divine might and strength, of Divine salvation and blessing" ('Biblische Archaologie,' &sect; 20). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-16.htm">Ezekiel 43:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the altar <i>shall be</i> twelve <i>cubits</i> long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - The measurements that now begin concern the breadth of <span class="cmt_word">the altar</span>, and proceed from above downwards. First the altar, or, <span class="accented">hearth of God</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ariel</span>) was <span class="cmt_word">twelve cubits long and twelve broad</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was square in the four squares (or, sides) thereof, or a perfect square (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>). Next the <span class="cmt_word">settle</span>, or, <span class="accented">enclosure</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 14, was <span class="cmt_word">fourteen</span> cubits long, and <span class="cmt_word">fourteen broad in the four squares</span> (or, sides) <span class="cmt_word">thereof</span>; the fourteen being made up of the twelve cubits of the altar-hearth's side with one cubit of ledge from the settle all round. The only question is to which "settle," the upper or the under, reference is made. Some expositors, identifying the greater Azarah with the Harel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "upper settle," with "the mount of God" or the base of the hearth, make the altar height only seven cubits from the ground to the hearth. The general belief, however, is that they cannot be so identified. Among interpreters who distinguish them, Kliefoth, with whom Smend agrees, holds the "settle" in this verse to be the <span class="accented">harel</span>, or "mount of God," which extended (Smend says with a <span class="accented">hek</span>. or "gutter") one cubit on each side beyond the <span class="accented">ariel</span>, or "hearth of God," so that the "mount of God," on which the" hearth of God" rested, was fourteen cubits square. Then, assuming a similar extension of one cubit at each stage - in the greater azarah, the lesser azarah, and the hek, or ground bottom - he finds the surface of the greater azarah to be sixteen, of the lesser azarah eighteen, and of the ground bottom twenty cubits square. Keil, with whom Schroder and Currey agree, objects to this as involving too much of arbitrary assumption, and takes the" settle" of this verse to mean the lower azarah; so that no additional measurements are required beyond those given in the text. If the square surface of the greater azarah be considered as having been the same as that of the harel, so that their sides were continuous, then, as the "ground bottom" extended one cubit on each side beyond the lower azarsh, the altar at its base was a square of sixteen cubits. Comparing now these measurements with those of the altar of burnt offering in the tabernacle and the temple, one finds that the former was only five cubits square and three cubits high (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>), while the latter was twenty cubits broad, but only ten cubits high (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), which awakes the suspicion that the different views above noted have been insensibly influenced by a desire on the part of their authors to make them harmonize with the measurements of the temple. But there does not appear sufficient reason why the measurements of Ezekiel's altar should have agreed with those of Solomon's rather than with those of Moses', <span class="cmt_word">The border</span> (or, <span class="accented">parapet</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of half a cubit</span> which ran round the ledge, or bottom, of a cubit, at the foot of the lower azarah was clearly designed, not for the protection of the priest officiating, but for ornament. The <span class="cmt_word">stairs</span> (or, <span class="accented">steps</span>), mention of which closes the description, mark a departure, not from the pattern of the Solomonic temple, in which the altar must have had steps (see Keil's 'Biblische Archaologie,' p. 141), but from the pattern of the tabernacle, in which altar-steps were disallowed (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>) and did not exist (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a>). But if, as Jewish tradition asserts, the pest-exilic altar had no steps as Ezekiel's had, having been reached by an inclined plane, because in the so-called book of the covenant steps were forbidden, how does this harmonize with the theory that Ezekiel's vision temple was designed as a model for the post-exilic temple? And why, if the priest-code was the composition of a writer who worked in the spirit and on the lines of Ezekiel, should it have omitted to assign steps to the tabernacle altar?

As the altar in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-46</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11-33</a>), and that in Solomon's temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63-66</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-4.htm">2 Chronicles 7:4-10</a>), so was this in Ezekiel's "house" dedicated by a special ceremonial before being brought into ordinary use. The particular ritual observed by Solomon is not described in detail; but a comparison between that enjoined upon and practiced by Moses with that revealed to and published by Ezekiel shows that while in some respects they agreed, in other important particulars they differed. In both the ceremony largely consisted in offering sacrifice and smearing blood, and lasted seven days; but in the former the ceremony was performed exclusively by Moses, consisted, in addition to the above, of an anointing of the altar, the holy utensils, and the tabernacle itself with oil, and was associated with the consecration of the priests; whereas in the latter, in addition to some variations in the sacrificial victims, which will be noted in the course of exposition, the priests should bear an active part - there should be no anointing with oil, and no consecration of the priests, the priesthood being assumed as already existing. If in Ezekiel's ritual there was no mention of a cleansing of the sanctuary (that of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a> referring to a special ease), but only of the altar, that was sufficiently explained by the circumstance that Jehovah was already in the "house." The final clause, to <span class="cmt_word">offer burnt offerings thereon</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and to sprinkle blood thereon</span>, indicates the purpose for which the altar was to be used. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt give to the priests</span>. This injunction, which was addressed to Ezekiel, not as the representative of the people or of the priests (Smend), but as the prophet of Jehovah, made it clear that Ezekiel was not to act in the future consecration of the altar alone as Moses did in the dedication of the tabernacle altar, but that the priests were to bear their part in the ceremonial. If some expressions, as the use of "thou" in this and the following verses, appear to suggest that Ezekiel alone should officiate, the employment of "they" in vers. 22, 24, 25, 26 as plainly indicates that Ezekiel's share in the ceremonial was to be performed through the medium of the priests. And, indeed, if the temple was a pattern designed to be converted into an actual building after the return from captivity, as the newer criticism contends, it is apparent that Ezekiel could not have been expected to have any hand in its erection. <span class="cmt_word">The Levites that be of the seed of Zadok</span>. The assistants of Ezekiel and the officiating priests at the new altar were not to be the whole body of the Levitical priesthood, but those only who derived their descent from Zadok (see on Ezekiel 44:15). <span class="cmt_word">A young bullock for a sin offering.</span> With the offering of this the ritual commenced, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 10</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a>). It is observable that in the Levitical code a young bullock, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of a bullock in the full vigor of youth, is appointed as the requisite sin offering for the priest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the high priest, who was the head and representative of the people.

The application of the victim's blood to and upon the altar formed an integral part of every expiatory offering; but "whereas in all the other kinds of sacrifice the blood was poured indifferently round about the altar of the fore court, in the sin offering it was not to be <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>, lest the intention should be overlooked, but <span class="accented">smeared</span> with the finger upon the horns of the altar ('And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns,' <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34</a>) (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 107). In the present instance the blood was to be carefully put upon <span class="cmt_word">the four horns</span> of the altar - the only part to be smeared with blood in the Mosaic  consecration (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">the four corners of the settle</span>, or azarah, but whether the greater or lesser is left undecided, though in all probability it was the under, if not both, and <span class="cmt_word">the border round about</span>, that mentioned in ver. 17; and the effect of this smearing with blood should be to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse and purge</span>, or, <span class="accented">make atonement</span> for, the altar; not for the people, as Havernick interprets, saying, "without an atoned-for altar, no atoned-for people (<span class="accented">ohne entsuhnten Altar</span>, <span class="accented">kein entsuhntes Volk</span>)," but for the altar, either, as Kliefoth suggests, because, being made out of a part of the sinful earth and world, it required to be sanctified, or because, as Plumptre prefers, the sins of the people having been, as it were, transferred to it, it stood in need of cleansing.

Ewald at first sought the place here referred to in the sacrificial kitchens (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>), which it could not be, as these belonged to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense; he has, however, since adopted the view of Kliefoth, which is doubtless correct, that the "place of the house, without the sanctuary" meant the <span class="accented">gizrah</span>, or separate place (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>), which was a part of the "house" in the widest sense, and yet belonged not to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense. Smend thinks of the <span class="accented">migrash</span>, "suburbs" or "open spaces," which surrounded the temple precincts (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>); and these were certainly without the sanctuary, while they were also appointed for the holy place, and might have been designated, as here, <span class="accented">miphkadh</span>, as being always under the inspection of the temple watchmen. The fact that in post-exilic times one of the city gates was called <span class="accented">Hammiphkadh</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a>) lends countenance to this view. That in this "appointed place" the carcass of the bullock should be consumed was a deviation from the Mosaic ritual, which prescribed that the fat portions should be burned upon the altar, and the rest eaten as a sacrificial meal (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-10.htm">Leviticus 4:10, 26, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>, 81; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7, 17, 18</a>). Keil appears to think that the fat portions may have been burned upon the altar, although it is not so mentioned, and that only "those points" were mentioned "in which deviations from the ordinary ritual took place." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-22.htm">Ezekiel 43:22</a></div><div class="verse">And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse <i>it</i> with the bullock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The second day's ceremonial should begin with the offering of <span class="cmt_word">a kid of the goats</span> (rather, a <span class="accented">he-goat</span>) <span class="cmt_word">without blemish for a sin offering</span>, the ritual observed being probably the same as that of the preceding day. The substitution of a "he-goat," the offering for a ruler who sins (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23, 24</a>), instead of a "young bullock," which formed the first day's offering, was a deviation from the ritual prescribed for the consecration of the Mosaic altar and priesthood (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>). The object of the offering of the "he-goat" was the same as that of the offering of the "bullock," viz. <span class="cmt_word">to cleanse the altar</span>; not, however, as if the previous day's cleansing had been insufficient and required to be supplemented, or had already become inefficient so as to call for renewal, but in the sense of recalling the meaning and impression of the previous day's ceremonial, and so in a manner linking it on with the several rites of the succeeding days. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-23.htm">Ezekiel 43:23</a></div><div class="verse">When thou hast made an end of cleansing <i>it</i>, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - The presentation of <span class="cmt_word">a burnt offering unto the Lord</span> was the next item in the ritual that should be observed.

The persons presenting it should be the prophet, <span class="cmt_word">thou</span>, and the priests, <span class="cmt_word">they</span>, as his representatives. The mode of offering should be by burning, the distinctive act in a burnt offering, as that of a sin offering was sprinkling, and that of a peace offering the sacrificial meal, and by casting <span class="cmt_word">salt</span> upon the carcass, a feature in every meat offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), and here added probably to intensify the idea of purification. "In the corrosive and antiseptic property of salt there is hidden something of the purifying and consuming nature of fire; hence the Redeemer, in <a href="../../par/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>, combines the salting of the sacrifice with the purifying fire of self- denial" (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 145). The significance of it should be an expression of complete self-surrender unto Jehovah, as the necessary outcome of the antecedent act of expiation. The time of its presentation should be immediately after the cleansing of the altar on the second day, and presumably also on the succeeding days. Whether the burnt offering was, as Keil maintains, or was not, as Kliefoth contends, offered also on the first day is difficult to decide, though the former opinion has, perhaps, most in its favor. The Mosaic ritual always enjoined a burnt offering to be offered as a sequel to the sin offering (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14, 18</a>, with  <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14, 18</a>; and see Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 86); and, in accordance with this, vers. 23 and 24 naturally follow on vers. 19-21, ver. 22 being interposed because of the variation in the sin offering for the second day.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-25.htm">Ezekiel 43:25</a></div><div class="verse">Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat <i>for</i> a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven days</span>. Hitzig reckons these as additional to the first (ver. 19) and second (ver. 22) days; Kliefoth begins them with the second; Keil, Schroder, Currey, and the majority of expositors take them as inclusive of the first and second. Hitzig's proposal may be set aside, since it cannot be maintained without erasing "thou shalt make atonement for it" in ver. 20, and the first half of the present verse. In favor of Kliefoth's view may be urged that the first day appears to stand out from the others, 'and to be distinguished by the peculiar character of its offering - a young bullock for a sin offering, without any accompanying burnt offering; that the offerings on the second and subsequent days are alike, a he-goat and a ram; that on each of the seven days a goat is mentioned for a sin offering, whereas on the first day it was a young bullock that was slain; and that in <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a> occurs an allusion to what seems a special day such as this first day of Ezekiel. In support of Keil's interpretation it is contended that the seven days were to be employed in purging or making atonement for, and purifying the altar, which was in part at least (even admitting a distinction in meaning between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) the business of the first day; that the general statement in ver. 20 as to a goat for a sin offering on the seven days admits of easy qualification by the previous statement in ver. 19; and that seven days was the normal duration of religious solemnities under the Law (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8, 9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-26.htm">Ezekiel 43:26</a></div><div class="verse">Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall purge the altar</span>. Smend thinks it strange that only the purification of the altar should be mentioned here, while that of the sanctuary is referred to later (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a>), and finds in this an explanation (at least, perhaps) of the fact that in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> only the consecration of the Mosaic altar - not of the Mosaic tabernacle - is reported. He conceives it likely that the author of <a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> copied Ezekiel, but does not explain why Ezekiel may not have copied the author of <a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall consecrate themselves</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">they - i.e.</span> the priests - <span class="accented">shall consecrate it</span>; literally, <span class="accented">fill</span> <span class="accented">its hand</span>. The phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, "to fill one's hand," sc. with gifts, occurs with reference to Jehovah (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-29.htm">Exodus 32:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-31.htm">2 Chronicles 29:31</a>). It is also employed in the sense of filling the hand of another, as e.g. of a priest, with sacrificial gifts, when he is instituted into his sacred office (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; comp, <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a>). Here the hand to be filled is that of the altar, which is personified for the purpose (compare the use of the terms "bosom" and "lip" in connection with the altar). The meaning is that the altar, at its consecration, should have a plentiful supply of gifts, to symbolize that the offering of such gifts was the work for which it was set apart, and that it should never be without them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-27.htm">Ezekiel 43:27</a></div><div class="verse">And when these days are expired, it shall be, <i>that</i> upon the eighth day, and <i>so</i> forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eighth day, and so forward</span>. Omit "so." With this day the regular sacrificial service should commence. Thenceforward the priests should offer upon the altar <span class="cmt_word">the burnt offerings and peace offerings</span> of the people. The omission of sin offerings is explained by Keil, on the principle that "burnt offerings" and "peace offerings" were "the principal and most frequent sacrifices, whilst sin offerings and meat offerings were implied therein;" Kliefoth adding that <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-27.htm">Ezekiel 44:27, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17, 19, 22, 23, 25</a>; and Ezekiel 46:20 show it cannot be inferred that sin offerings were no more to be offered on this altar. At the same time, the prominence given to "burnt" and "peace" as distinguished from "sin offerings" may, as Schroder suggests, have pointed to the fact that the sacrificers who should use this altar would be "a people in a state of grace," to whom Jehovah was prepared to say, <span class="cmt_word">I will accept you</span>, not your offerings alone, but your persons as well; and not these because of those, but contrariwise, these on account of these. Kliefoth's idea, that the first day symbolized the future day of Christ's sacrifice, that the seven intermediate days (on his hypothesis) pointed to the period of the Christian Church, and that the eighth day looked forward to the time of the end, while not without elements of truth, is open to this objection, that in the period of the Christian Church there should have been "no more sacrifice for sin;" and yet, as Kliefoth admits, "sin offerings" were afterwards to be made upon this altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/42.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 42"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 42" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/44.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 44"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 44" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
