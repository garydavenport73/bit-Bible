<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10</span> set forth as the first proof of the greatness of Gog's overthrow the immense booty in the shape of weapons of war which should be obtained by the inhabitants of the cities of Israel. So huge should be the quantity of weapons left behind by the slain, that the Israelites should <span class="cmt_word">burn them with fire seven years</span>. This burning of the weapons has been explained by Havernick, on the ground that weapons of war, as incompatible with Messianic times, should be no more required (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>); by Ewald, as in accordance with the custom of the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>) and other ancient peoples (Livy, 38:23; Virgil, 'AEneid,' 8:562); by Hitzig and Smend, as prompted by the consideration that Israel, for whom Jehovah had fought, should have no further need of weapons; by Schroder, as indicating that for Israel these warlike instruments should then so completely lose their power to terrify that they might be looked upon simply as so much firewood; and by Keil, as designed to annihilate the enemy and remove every trace of him. Kliefoth appears nearest the mark, in suggesting that the emphasis lies upon the length of time the burning should continue; and that this was intended, by conveying an idea of the vastness of the spoil, to represent the thoroughness of Gog's destruction and of Israel's deliverance. That the whole delineation is symbolical appears from the number of years the weapons are said to serve for fuel, viz. seven, and from the character of the weapons themselves, which, if not entirely wooden, were at least all combustible. Of the "armor" generally (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>, "something joined," from a root signifying "to join") the pieces mentioned - <span class="cmt_word">the shields and the bucklers</span> (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>), <span class="cmt_word">the bows and arrows</span> (see ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">the hand-staves</span>, or, <span class="accented">javelins</span> (margin), perhaps, as Hitzig and Smend suggest, the staff with which a horseman strikes his beast (see <a href="../../par/numbers/22-27.htm">Numbers 22:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and the spears</span> - were mostly composed of timber. When all should have been given to the flames, it would then appear that on their late owners the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span> had worked out its literal avengement, that they who had intended to despoil Israel were themselves spoiled; and they who hoped to plunder Israel were themselves plundered (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>).

Concerning both the designation and the site of this divinely provided sepulcher controversy has arisen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">As to its site</span>. The notion of Michaelis and Eiehhom, that <span class="cmt_word">the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea</span> was in some way related to the mountains of Abarim mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>, and that of Hitzig, that it signified "the valley of the opposite heights," as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-3.htm">1 Samuel 17:3</a>, and was to be sought for in the "very great valley" of <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, may at once be dismissed - the former as untenable, and -the latter as far-fetched. The suggestion of Hengstenberg and Kliefoth, that by the burial-place of Gog was meant the valley of Megiddo, where Josiah fell in battle against Pharaoh-Necho (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), derives support from these considerations, that the very name of Megiddo points to battles, that in its vicinity are found such passes as are here described, and that its modern designation <span class="accented">Lejun</span> (<span class="accented">Leqio</span>), in all probability contains a reminiscence of the present passage. It is, however, open to the obvious objections that the place of Gog's burial was not contiguous to the field of his overthrow, and that the clause locating it "on the <span class="accented">east of the sea</span>," by which on this hypothesis must be understood the Mediterranean, is rather descriptive of the entire land than of any particular spot therein. Hence the view of Havernick, Ewald, Keil, and Smoud, which finds the valley in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea, is to be preferred, though, even with agreement as to this, interpreters are not unanimous as to the spot intended. Ewald thinks of "the horrible, unwholesome valley over against the sea, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>) the Dead Sea, that valley which covers the ancient overbearing ones (<span class="accented">die Zerreisenden</span>), the Sodomites, who resemble these;" Keil, translating <span class="accented">kidmath</span> as "in front of," holds by "the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea;" Havernick and Smend advocate "a place outside the Holy Land," though the clause, "a grave in Israel," seems against this. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' hints, net without reason, that the valley was "imaginary." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">As to its designation</span>. That in the word "passengers" lies a paronomasia is apparent; but whether threefold or only twofold is uncertain. In the present verse <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> may signify either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> such travelers as were wont to pass through the valley (Keil), which is the obvious and natural interpretation; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the warriors of Gog (Ewald, Hitzig), who intended to pass through the land, but whose invasion had only proved a passing storm; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the commissioners who should be appointed to pass through the land in search of bones (ver. 15). The notion of Ewald, who derives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and translates "haughty," "overbearing," meaning the Gogites, is countenanced by no ether expositor. If the first sense be taken, then the verse will read, "The valley of the passers through, and it (the valley, in consequence of having become the grave of Gog) stops (the way of) the passers through;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it becomes thereafter impassable for travelers (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil); or, it stops the noses, or breath, of such travelers by reason of its horrible stench (Ewald, Havernick). If the second meaning be selected, the valley must be understood to have afterwards received its name from the fact that Gog's warriors lay entombed beneath its sod, and "the stopping of the passengers" to signify that whereas Gog purposed to overrun the land, his destructive career was there ignominiously arrested (Schroder). If the third rendering be preferred, then the valley will be held to have derived its designation, after the event, from the passing through it or through the land of the searchers, in which case the stepping of the passengers can only have alluded to the fact that, as the "buriers" proceeded with the work of interment, they were compelled to turn away their faces and stop their noses because of the noisome effluvium which arose from the corpses. The first interpretation is the best, though the first and second might be combined by making the first "passengers" stand for the travelers and the second for the invaders, whose career should there be stopped; and to this view a certain countenance is lent by the statements which follow, that there should <span class="cmt_word">Gog and all his multitude</span> - literally, <span class="accented">all his noisy tumult - be</span> buried, and that the valley ever afterwards should bear the name of <span class="cmt_word">Hamon-gog</span>, or, <span class="accented">Gog</span> <span class="accented">s multitude</span>.

It is impossible to decide dogmatically in a question of so much difficulty; but the Revised Version appears to present the most exact rendering of the Hebrew, and upon the whole the most intelligible account of what was intended to take place, viz. the appointment of a special body of commissioners, who should be designated both "passengers," in ironical allusion to Gog who had meant to pass through the land, and "buffers," from the nature of the task delegated to them, viz. the interment of the "passengers," i.e. the Gogites, and who should begin their work after the main body of the slain had been removed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the end of the seven months of burying.

If quite improbable that Bethshan or Scythopolis near Megiddo was Ezekiel's Hamonah, it is possible the actual city may have been named after the ideal. Plumptre cites as a modern parallel the English town of Lichfield (or "Field of corpses"), which, according to tradition, commemorates the destruction of the Danes. When the work of the buriers should be finished, the land would be completely cleansed.

The special lesson for them should be not so much teaching concerning God's supremacy over them, or concerning their relation to Israel, as concerning the principles of God's dealings with Israel. They should learn that if Israel had for a season been abandoned to the sword and driven into exile, it was not because of Jehovah's inability to protect them, but because of their wickedness which had caused him to hide his face from them - an expression which in Ezekiel occurs only here and in ver. 29, though it is found in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17, 18</a>) and in the older prophets (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a>).

It is in substance a recapitulation of God's gracious promise to bring again the captivity of Israel, of which the prophet had just been reminded in ver. 23, and to which accordingly he now in thought goes back. It traces the whole course of the Divine dealings with the nation from the point of the exile onwards. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will bring again the captivity of Jacob</span>. (For the use of "Jacob" as a designation of the people, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>.) The promise goes back to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-23.htm">Jeremiah 31:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>; and other passages. That its fulfillment began with the return from Babylon is not inconsistent with the view that its fulfillment will terminate with the final ingathering of Israel out of the nations by her conversion to Christianity, and her consequent admission to the Church. That its first cause will be "mercy" to the whole house of Israel will not prevent that cause from being at the same time a jealous regard for the Divine holiness (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21, 22</a>).

The captivity of Israel would not be brought back until her people had been thoroughly chastised for their iniquities, and that chastisement had wrought in them a spirit of penitence and a disposition towards obedience. Then should Jehovah interpose for their deliver-ante by gathering them out of their enemies' lands and leading them back to their own land; and these two experiences, the  Captivity and the Restoration, the driving out and the bringing in, should complete their conversion to Jehovah, and secure their perpetual enjoyment of Jehovah's favor.

Already Jehovah had promised to put his Spirit in his people (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-14.htm">Ezekiel 37:14</a>); now the fact that he has implemented that promise by a copious effusion of the same he cites as a proof that Israel shall no more forfeit his favor because no more shall she forsake his ways (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>). The same promise had been previously given by Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>), and was afterwards renewed by Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). The citation of Joel's words by Peter on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="../../par/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>) shows that he regarded the remarkable effusion of the Holy Ghost on that memorable occasion as a fulfillment of the premise here recorded by Ezekiel. Yet the promise was not then exhausted. Rather it has often since been implemented, and will doubtless receive its consummation in the New Jerusalem. "No historical Church, Jewish or Gentile," writes Plumptre, "has ever yet realized the picture here sketched by Ezekiel. We ask, as before - Will it ever be realized on earth? or must we look for it only in the heavenly city whose Builder and Maker is God?" <span class="cmt_word">NOTE.</span> - In addition to what has been stated at the beginning of this prophecy (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-1.htm">Ezekiel 38:1</a>) with reference to the general significance of this invasion by and overthrow of Cog, that it points to some tremendous conflict in the latter days between the powers of the world and the Church of Christ, a few words may be offered in support of the preposition that nevertheless there is no reason to expect that this conflict will take the form of an actual invasion of the land of Israel or of a real fire-and-sword battle with the Church, or that Gog will step upon the field as a veritable flesh-and-blood personality, and his armies find a grave in the manner sketched by the prophet. That the whole delineation is symbolic, and embodies spiritual truths under material emblems, will hardly be doubted by one who impartially weighs the following considerations, which have been admirably brought together by Fairbairn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The designation given to the great assailant of the latter times -  Gog, which discovers itself to be an ideal name, if by nothing else by the manner in which it has been formed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The composition of his army, which is drawn from the four quarters of the globe, in fact, from the extremities of the earth, and consists of peoples not only remote from one another, but "the most unlike naturally to act in concert for any particular purpose." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The object of his attack - the land of Israel, a territory so small that it is inconceivable a host so great should have been required to capture it, and so poor that had the invaders got all it contained it "could not have served to maintain them for a single day." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The fruits of Israel's victory - firewood for seven years out of the enemies' weapons, and seven months of labor in burying their corpses. "It would be but a very moderate allowance, on the literal supposition, to say that a million of men would thus be engaged, and that on an average each would consign two corpses to the tomb in one day; which for the hundred and eighty working days of the seven months would make an aggregate of three hundred and sixty millions of corpses! Then the putrefaction, the pestilential vapors arising from such masses of slain victims, before they were all buried. Who could live at such a time?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The impossibility of harmonizing prophecy on the hypothesis that Ezekiel's picture must receive a literal interpretation, since Isaiah (Isaiah 34.), Joel (Joel 3:12, 14), and Zechariah (Zechariah 14), who all appear to depict the same conflict as Ezekiel portrays, each pitches its scene in a different locality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The gross carnality of the whole picture on the assumption that it must be literally interpreted, which is wholly inconsistent with that spirituality one associates with the Messianic times. "Persons," writes Fairbairn, "who in the face of all these considerations can still cling to the literal view of this prophecy, must be left to themselves; they are incapable of being convinced in the way of argument."  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/38.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 38"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 38" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/40.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 40"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 40" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
