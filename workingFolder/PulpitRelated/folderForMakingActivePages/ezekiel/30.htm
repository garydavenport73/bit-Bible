Jerome, Havernick, Hitzig, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kliefoth, and others are in favor of the former view, chiefly on the ground that Ver. 3 speaks of the nearness of the coming judgment. That the day of the Lord should be "near" is, however, too vague and relative a term to be decisive. On the whole, the question must be left as one which we have no sufficient data for solving. The close parallelism with <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29</a>. seems to me slightly in favor of the second view. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-2.htm">Ezekiel 30:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl ye</span>. The words read like an echo of <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, and find a parallel also in <a href="../../par/joel/1-11.htm">Joel 1:11, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Woe worth the day!</span> It may be well to note that the familiar phrase is a survival of the Anglo-Saxon verb <span class="accented">weorthan</span> (German <span class="accented">werden</span>), "to become," so that its exact meaning is "Woe be to the day" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a></div><div class="verse">For the day <i>is</i> near, even the day of the LORD <i>is</i> near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The day of the Lord</span>. Here, as everywhere (see note on Ezekiel 13:5), the words stand for any time in which the Divine judgments manifest themselves in the world's history. Of it Ezekiel says, following in the footsteps of Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>), that it shall be <span class="cmt_word">a day of cloud</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of darkness and trouble; <span class="cmt_word">a day of the heathen</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a time in which the heathen who had exulted in the punishment of Israel should know that the Lord was their Judge also, that he had his "day" appointed for them.

The words point to the extension of the invasion of Egypt - by Nebuchadnezzar in the first instance, and afterwards by other conquerors - to the upper valley of the Nile. <span class="cmt_word">They shall take away her multitude</span>. The word is taken by Keil, Smend, and others of things rather than persons, the multitude of possessions. Hengstenberg renders "tumult" in the sense of the stir of a crowded city. The <span class="cmt_word">foundations</span> are probably to be taken figuratively of the bases of the prosperity of Egypt, its allies and mercenaries, rather than of actual buildings (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>).

Here the Authorized Version gives (rightly enough, though inconsistently) the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Phut</span>, which is reproduced in the Revised Version. The <span class="accented">Lydians</span>, in like manner, stand for Lud; but we have to remember, as before (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>),  that they are the African, and not the Asiatic, people of that name. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> the two nations are named among the auxiliaries of Egypt. Possibly the similarity of name may have led to the term being used also for the Lydian and Ionian forces enlisted by Psam-metichus I. (Herod., 3:4); but there seems more reason for including these in the <span class="cmt_word">mingled people</span> that are next mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Chub</span>, or Cub (Revised Version), is found here only, and has consequently given occasion to many guesses Havernick connects it with the <span class="accented">Kufa</span>, a district of Media, often named in Egyptian monuments; Michaelis, with Kobe on the Ethiopian coast of the Indian Ocean; Maurer, with Cob, a city of Mauretania; Gesenius, Ewald, and Bunsen suggest the reading <span class="accented">Nub</span>, and identify it with Nubia; Keil and Smend adopt the form Lub, found in the Lubim of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a> and <a href="../../par/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>. On the whole, there are no adequate data for the solution of the problem. <span class="cmt_word">The men of the land that is in league.</span> Here, again, we are in a region of many conjectures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Hitzig and Kliefoth (following Jerome and the LXX., which gives, "the land of my covenant") take it of Canaan, as being the land in covenant with Jehovah (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hengstenberg, for the Sabeans, as being members of the Judaeo-Egyptian confederacy implied in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil, Ewald, and Smend, of a people among the allies of Egypt, unknown to us, but sufficiently designated by Ezekiel for his readers.

The <span class="cmt_word">ships</span> are those that bear the tidings of the conquest of Lower Egypt to the upper valley of the Nile. The <span class="cmt_word">careless Ethiopians</span> are so named as confiding in their remoteness from the scene of action. They thought themselves safe, and were lulled into a false security (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9-11</a> and <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>, for a like rendering of the verb). <span class="cmt_word">As in the day of Egypt.</span> As Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>) refers to "<span class="accented">the</span> day of Midian," so Ezekiel points to the memorable time when like tidings of the judgments that fell on Egypt carried dismay into the hearts of the surrounding nations (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14, 15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the hand of Nebuchadnezzar</span>. Hitherto (on the assumption that <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17-21</a> stands by itself, and that we are still in the prophetic message of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-1.htm">Ezekiel 29:1-16</a>) the predictions have been general. Now Ezekiel, following in the footsteps of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46.htm">Ezekiel 46</a>.), specifies the Chaldean king and his people, the terrible of the nations (as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-7.htm">Ezekiel 28:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>.), as those who were to execute the Divine judgments.

The <span class="accented">rivers</span> are the Nile-blanches of the Delta, and their being <span class="accented">dried</span> up points, perhaps, literally to a failure in the inundation of the Nile on which its fertility depended; figuratively to a like failure of all its sources of prosperity.

The modern name <span class="accented">Pheromi</span> has the same meaning. The remains of an old fortress near the town are still known as <span class="accented">Tineh</span>, the "clay" of <a href="../../par/daniel/2-41.htm">Daniel 2:41</a>. The fortress stood on the eastern branch of the Nile, surrounded by swamps, and its position made it, in modern phrase, the "key" of Egypt. Suidas and Strabo (<span class="accented">ut supra</span>) describe it as an obstacle to invaders from the East. Ezekiel, in describing it as "the <span class="accented">strength of</span> Egypt," must have known its local characteristics. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of No</span>; in the Hebrew, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25</a>, <span class="accented">Hamon-No</span>.

The city should be <span class="accented">attacked</span>, not by night (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>), but in open day (compare "the spoiler at noonday" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>).

Here that sense is clearly inappropriate. The LXX. and Vulgate give "the scepters" of Egypt, which implies a different reading, and this is adopted in substance by Ewald and Smend, the latter preferring rendering it by "supports" or "props," the "red" being used as a "staff" rather than as a "scepter" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pomp of her strength</span>. The phrase meets us again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>, and includes what we speak of as the parade of power, here probably with a view to the foreign forces that garrisoned both Daphne and Pelusium.

What is characteristic in Ezekiel is the way in which he follows the figure, so to speak, into its surgical details. A man with a broken arm might be cured and fight again; but it was not to be so with Pharaoh. His arm was not to be bound with a roller (the equivalent of the modern process of putting it in "splints"). The Hebrew word for "roller" is not found elsewhere, and Ezekiel's use of it is one of the instances of his knowledge of surgery. The corresponding verb is used by him of the bandages or swaddling-clothes of infancy (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-22.htm">Ezekiel 30:22</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <i>am</i> against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The strong, and that which was broken</span>. The image is pressed yet further. A warrior whose sword-arm was broken might go on fighting with his left. Hophra might continue to struggle, though with diminished strength. Ezekiel's words shut out the hope of any such struggle. The left arm also should be broken as the right had been. The Chaldean king should wax stronger and stronger. The sword of Nebuchadnezzar should be as truly "the sword of Jehovah," as that of Gideon had been (<a href="../../par/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>). Figuratively, he should stand before him groaning as a man wounded to the death. So in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-26.htm">Jeremiah 46:26</a>, we have allusions to an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, which was to end in his sitting on his throne in the stronghold of Tahapanes.

The arms of the Egyptian king are described, not as broken, but as feeble. They hang down by his side instead of wielding the sword. I will scatter, etc. The prophet dwells once more, repeating the very words of Ver. 23 and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-12.htm">Ezekiel 29:12</a> with all the emphasis of iteration, on the dispersion which was the almost inevitable sequel of an Oriental conquest. There in the land of exile they should see that they had been fighting against God; and so the prophet ends the chapter with his ever-recurring formula, <span class="cmt_word">They shall know that I am Jehovah</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
