So, in ver. 3, the <span class="cmt_word">righteous</span> and the <span class="cmt_word">wicked</span> take the place of the "green" and the "dry" tree, and the fire is explained as meaning the sword of the invader. The teaching of ch. 18, had shown that Ezekiel had entered, as regards the ultimate judgment of individual men, into the spirit of Abram's words "That be far from thee to destroy the righteous with the wicked" (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). But in regard to temporal judgments there would be in this case, as in the complaint of <a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>, no distinction.

He is to act the part of a mourner, whose sighs are so deep that they seem to "break his loins" (compare, for the gesture, <a href="../../par/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1, 10</a> <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>). The strange action was meant to lead to questions. What did it mean? And then he is to answer that he does it "for the tidings" which are to him as certain as if they had already come. He is but doing what all would do, when the messenger brought word, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>, five years later, that the city was at last smitten.

More than most other portions of Ezekiel's writings, it assumes a distinctly lyrical character, and might be headed, "The Lay of the Sword of Jehovah." The opening words are probably an echo of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>.

Here the "rod" is the "sceptre" of the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), and the words are supposed to be spoken by those who hear of the destroying sword. They need not dread the sword, they say, because the sceptre of the house of David, whom Jehovah recognizes as his son, despises all wood, looks on every other rod that is the symbol of sovereignty, with scorn. It is urged, in favour of this interpretation, that ver. 27 contains an unmistakable refer, nee to the prophetic words of <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald: <span class="accented">It is no weak rod of my son, the softest of all wood</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sword of Jehovah is no weak weapon such as might be used for the chastisement of a child (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hengstenberg: <span class="accented">Shall we rejoice over the rod of my son, despising every tree?</span> There is no cause for anything but the reverse of joy in the rod, the punishment which God appoints for Israel as his son, and which surpasses all others in its severity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Authorized Version and Revised Version (margin) make the "sword" the nominative, and the words are those of Jehovah: <span class="accented">It contemneth the rod</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sceptre) <span class="accented">of my son, as it contemns every other tree</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-4.htm">Ezekiel 20:4</a>), <span class="accented">every other national sovereignty</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The Revised.

Neither the LXX. nor the Vulgate help us, the former giving, "Slay, set at naught, reject every tree;" and the latter, "Thou who guidest the sceptre of my son, thou hast cut down." On the whole, (1) seems to rest on better ground than the others.

At this stage, in contemplating the destruction alike of princes and of people, the prophet is bidden to make his gestures of lamentation yet more expressive, "crying, howling, smiting on his thigh" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>).

It shall not be;" and the Vulgate, "And this when it (the sword!) has overturned the kingdom,  and it shall not be," etc. This will be a sufficient summary of the difficulties of the exegetical problem. At the best, we must say that it remains unsolved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-14.htm">Ezekiel 21:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite <i>thine</i> hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it <i>is</i> the sword of the great <i>men that are</i> slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Smite thine hands together</span>, etc. Another gesture follows, either of horror and lamentation, or perhaps, looking to ver. 17, of imperative command. The sword is to do its thrice-redoubled work (the words emphasize generally the intensity, and are scarcely to be taken numerically, of the repeated invasions of the Chaldeans); it is "the sword of the slain" (better, <span class="accented">pierced ones</span>, or, with Revised Version, <span class="accented">the deadly wounded</span>). The next clause should be taken, with the Revised Version, in the singular - <span class="accented">the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded</span>; <span class="accented">sc</span>. the sword should smite the king as well as the people.

Whichever way the prophet turned (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>), he would see nothing but the sword and its work of slaughter. Jehovah had given that command with the gesture of supreme authority. He would not rest till he had appeased his wrath by letting it work itself out even to the end. With these words the "Lay of the Sword of Jehovah" ends, and there is again an interval of silence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-17.htm">Ezekiel 21:17</a></div><div class="verse">I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - The new section opens in a different strain. Ezekiel sees, as in vision, Nebuchadnezzar and his army on their march.

Both come from one land, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from Babylon; but from that point onwards one road led to Rabbath, the capital of the Ammonites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), the other to Jerusalem. Apparently, the exiles and the people of Judah flattered themselves that the former was the object of the expedition. The answer to that false hope is a vivid picture of what was passing in the council of war which Nebuchadnezzar was holding at that parting of the ways. The prophet sees, as it were, the sign post pointing, as with a hand, to each of the two cities The king consults his soothsayers, and uses divinations. Of these Ezekiel enumerates three: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">He shakes the arrows to and fro</span> (Revised Version).

I follow the translation of the Revised Version, and explain it by inserting words which are needed to bring out its meaning: <span class="accented">It</span> (what Nebuchadnezzar has done) <span class="accented">shall be as a vain divination in their sight</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. in that of the men of Jerusalem), <span class="accented">which have sworn unto them</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. have taken oaths of fealty to the Chaldeans, and are ready to take them again), <span class="accented">but he</span> (Nebuchadnezzar) <span class="accented">brings iniquity to remembrance</span>. The fact represented is that when the people of Jerusalem heard of the divination at the parting of the ways, they still lulled themselves in a false security. They and Zedekiah had sworn obedience, and that oath would protect them. "Not so," rejoins the prophet; "the Chaldean king knows how those oaths have been kept." The LXX. omits all reference to "oaths." The Vulgate. taking the word for "oath" in its ether sense of "sabbath," gives the curious rendering, <span class="accented">Eritque quasi consulens frustra oraculum in eorum oculis, et sabbatorum otium imitans</span>. In spite of the reports that reached them, the men of Jerusalem thought themselves as safe as if the Chaldean king were keeping a sabbath day. Ewald partly follows the Vulgate, and renders, <span class="accented">They believe they have weeks on weeks</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will not believe that the danger is close at hand. Keil and Havernick: <span class="accented">Oaths of oaths are theirs</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they count on the oath of Jehovah, on his promises of protection, but he (Jehovah) brings iniquity to remembrance. <span class="cmt_word">That they may be taken</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. be seized by the invader and either slain or made prisoners

The word "deadly wounded," or "sorely smitten," may rightly be applied to one who fell, as Zedekiah did, from his high estate. From the sins of the people the prophet turns to the special guilt of Zedekiah, who had proved unfaithful alike to Jehovah and to the Chaldean king, whom he had owned as his suzerain. <span class="cmt_word">His day</span> had at last come, the <span class="cmt_word">time</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the iniquity of the end</span> of the last transgression which was to bring down on him the final punishment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> the same: exalt <i>him that is</i> low, and abase <i>him that is</i> high.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remove the diadem,</span> etc. The noun is used throughout the Pentateuch (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>; 37:39; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-9.htm">Leviticus 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>) for the "turban" or "mitre" of the high priest, and Keil so takes it here, as pointing to the punishment of the priest as well as of the king. <span class="cmt_word">This shall not be the same;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this shall not be this</span>; or, as the Revised Version paraphrases, <span class="accented">this shall be no more the same</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the mitre and the crown shall alike pass away - taken from their unworthy wearers. There was to be, as in the following words, a great upturning of all things; the high brought low, the lowly exalted.

"That order," Ezekiel says, "shall be no more." Keil, however, takes the second "it" - the "this" of the Revised Version - as meaning the fact of the overthrow. That also was not final; all things were as in a state of flux till the Messianic kingdom hinted at in the next clause should restore the true order. <span class="cmt_word">Until he come whose right it is.</span> The words contain a singularly suggestive allusion to <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where a probable interpretation of the word "Shiloh" is "he to whom it belongs;" or, as the LXX. gives it, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;</span>. The passage is noticeable as being Ezekiel's first distinct utterance of the hope of a personal Messiah. Afterwards, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>, it is definite enough. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a></div><div class="verse">And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword <i>is</i> drawn: for the slaughter <i>it is</i> furbished, to consume because of the glittering:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God concerning the Ammonites.</span> Ezekiel has not forgotten that scene at the parting of the ways. The Ammonites, when they saw the issue of the divination, and the march of the Chaldean army to the west, thought themselves safe. They took up their reproach against Jerusalem, and exulted in its fall. They are warned, as in another strophe of the "Lay of the Sword of Jehovah," that their confidence is vain (comp. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a> for a like exultation at an earlier period). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a></div><div class="verse">Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <i>them that are</i> slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whiles they see,</span> etc. The words may possibly refer to Nebuchadnezzar's diviners in ver. 21, but more probably to those whom the Ammonites themselves consulted. The pronoun "thee" in both clauses refers to Ammon. The result of those who divined falsely was that the sword would be drawn against the necks of the Ammonites and threw them upon the heap of the slaughtered ones. For them, as in the words that end the verse, reproducing those of ver. 25, punishment is decreed, and that punishment will come. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-30.htm">Ezekiel 21:30</a></div><div class="verse">Shall I cause <i>it</i> to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I cause it</span>, etc.? The question of the Authorized Version suggests a negative answer, as though the speaker were Jehovah, and the sheath that of his sword. The Revised Version, which translates it, with Keil, the LXX., and the Vulgate, as an imperative, deals with it as addressed to the Ammonites. They am told to sheath their sword; it would be of no avail against the sharp, glittering weapon of Jehovah. Their judgment would soon come on them in their own land, not, as in the case of Judah, in the form of exile (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-1.htm">Ezekiel 25:1-8</a> as an expansion of the prophet's thought). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-31.htm">Ezekiel 21:31</a></div><div class="verse">And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <i>and</i> skilful to destroy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will blow against,</span> etc. The imagery of fire takes the place of that of the sword. <span class="cmt_word">The brutish men</span> (same word as in <a href="../../par/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>) are the Chaldean conquerors. The fact that the adjective may also mean "those that burn" may, in part, have determined Ezekiel's choice of it.
