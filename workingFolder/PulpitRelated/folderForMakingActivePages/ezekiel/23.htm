Thus <i>were</i> their names; Samaria <i>is</i> Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The occurrence of proper names is almost unique in the parables of the Bible, the Lazarus of <a href="../../par/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> being  the only other instance. Their meaning is sufficiently clear. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah</span> (but both names should begin with O rather than A) means "Her tent;" <span class="cmt_word">Aholibah</span>, "My tent is in her." A parallel, which may have suggested the names, is found in the <span class="accented">Aholibamah</span> (equivalent to "My tent is in the high place") of <a href="../../par/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a>, and another in the use of <span class="accented">Ohel</span> as a proper name in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a>. The common element of the two names is the word that is commonly used for the sacred tent or tabernacle in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. The distinctive element of each points to the fact that the worship in Samaria was unauthorized. Her "tent" was hers, not Jehovah's. Of Jerusalem with its temple Jehovah could say, "My tent is in her," and this, as magnifying her privilege, also aggravated her guilt. Keil and others take the adjective here, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, as meaning "greater" rather than "older." The former adjective is, of course, applicable to the greater power of the kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and, even if we retain the renderings of the Authorized Version, is probably the explanation of Samaria being named as the <span class="cmt_word">elder</span> of the two. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians <i>her</i> neighbours,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The history of both the sisters passes from the time of the Exodus to that of their separate existence, and starts, in fact, from their first intercourse with the great monarchies of Asia. So far it is less a survey of their successive stages of degradation, like that of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, than a retrospect of their political alliances. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah played the harlot</span>. The lovers, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-33.htm">Ezekiel 16:33</a>, are the nations with which the kings of Israel were in alliance, and of these the Assyrians are named as pre-eminent. The word <span class="cmt_word">neighbors</span>, which in its literal sense is hardly applicable, is probably to be taken of spiritual affinity, or may be taken as "come near" is in <a href="../../par/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-16.htm">Leviticus 20:16</a>. The Assyrians were those who, in that sense, came near to the harlot city. We have in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a> the fact that Menahem paid tribute to Pul. <a href="../../par/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> and Hosea 7:11 speak generally of such alliances. The black obelisk of Shalmaneser records the fact that Jehu paid tribute to him ('Records of the Past,' 5:41). In the last-named case the tribute consisted chiefly of vessels of gold, bowls, goblets, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Which were</i> clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with blue</span>. The same word as that used in the description of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-4.htm">Exodus 26:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>.). It was probably some hue of the Tyrian purple kind which marked the official dress of the "captains" of the Assyrian armies. The words, with those that follow, bring before us the magnificent array of the Assyrian cavalry - a force in which Israel, throughout its history, was deficient (<a href="../../par/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-7.htm">Ezekiel 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them <i>that were</i> the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - The next two verses paint the consequence of the alliance first with Assyria and then with Egypt. She adopted the religion of Assyria, probably in the form of the worship of Ishtar (Ashtoreth) as the queen of heaven. Having done this, the kings of Israel sought to play off one kingdom against the other (see <a href="../../par/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>). It was, in fact, the discovery of Hoshea's treachery in this matter that led Shalmaneser to besiege Samaria. The result of that siege is described in general terms in Ver. 10. She, the city of Samaria, was slain with the sword, tier sons and daughters were taken into exile. So she became <span class="cmt_word">famous</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> infamous, like the Latin <span class="accented">famosus</span>), literally, <span class="accented">a name</span> among women, <span class="accented">so</span>. among the neighboring nations.

But it did not. They also 'courted the alliance of the kings of Assyria, as in the case of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-10</a>) and Tiglath-Pileser. Hezekiah followed in the same line, though he too trusted in Egypt, and afterwards rebelled. Manasseh too paid tribute, and made Jerusalem the scene of a confluent idolatry, which included that of Assyria. Even Josiah went forth against Pharaoh-Necho as the faithful vassal of either Assyria or Babylon. The splendor which had fascinated Samaria fascinated her also. Here <span class="cmt_word">clothed most gorgeously</span> takes the place of "clothed in blue" in Ver. 6, describing, probably, the same fact. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a></div><div class="verse">She doted upon the Assyrians <i>her</i> neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</div><div class="comm">

She courted the alliance of the Chaldeans. Probably the sojourn of Manasseh at Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>) led him to see in that city a possible rival to Assyria. The embassy of Merodach-Baladan to Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/39.htm">Isaiah 39</a>.) implies, on the other hand, that Babylon was looking to Judah for support against Assyria. The prophet represents this political coquetting, so to speak, as another act of whoredom. Aholibah saw the <span class="cmt_word">images of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion</span> (probably "red ochre:" colors seem to have been used largely both in Assyrian and Babylonian sculpture as in Egyptian, and Judah seems to have copied them, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>) and fell in love with them. As the passions of a Messalina might be roused by sensuous pictures of masculine beauty, so Judah was led on by what her envoys reported of the magnificence of the palaces, the strength of the armies, of the Chaldeans. The journey of Jonah to Nineveh, and those implied in <a href="../../par/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>, as well as the prophecy of Nahum, all indicate a more or less intimate knowledge of the Mesopotamian monarchies. The  mission of Merodach-Baladan would be naturally followed by a return embassy from Judah. A later instance under Zedekiah meets us in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-15.htm">Ezekiel 23:15</a></div><div class="verse">Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Exceeding in dyed attire</span>; better, <span class="accented">with dyed turbans</span>, or <span class="accented">tiaras</span>, such as are seen on the Assyrian monuments of Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Kouyunyik.

As in the history of Amnon (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-15.htm">2 Samuel 13:15</a>), lust, when it had wrought its will, passed into loathing and disgust. Jehoiakim and Zedekiah were examples of what we may well call this distracted policy. But, as it was, this alienation did but increase her guilt. As things were, it would have been better, as Jeremiah all along counseled, to accept the rule of the Chaldeans. The mind of Jehovah was alienated from Jerusalem as hers had been from the Chaldeans. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a></div><div class="verse">So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</div><div class="comm">

The disappointment and failure, however, did not lead to repentance. Foreign alliances, and with them foreign idolatries, were courted more eagerly than ever, though in a different direction. The lovers were changed, but the harlotry went on. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a></div><div class="verse">For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh <i>is as</i> the flesh of asses, and whose issue <i>is like</i> the issue of horses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She doted on her paramours</span>. Commonly the word is used of a concubine (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-24.htm">Genesis 22:24</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-31.htm">Judges 8:31</a>). Here it is used in scorn of the Egyptian princes whose favor Judah courted, reminding us of Homer's <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, as indicating their political weakness. All that need be said of the comparison that follows is that here also Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>). What is indicated is that Judah threw herself into the idolatrous ritual of Egypt with an almost orgiastic passion. The harlot nation returned, as it were, to her first love, and renewed the whoredoms of her youth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a></div><div class="verse">Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</div><div class="comm">

With these are joined <span class="cmt_word">Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa</span>. The Authorized and Revised Versions, following the LXX. take these as proper names, and Ewald Smend, and Furst find in them those of Chaldean tribes. The Vulgate, followed by Luther, gives <span class="accented">nobiles, tyrannosque, et principes</span>, and Keil and Hengstenberg substantially adopt this rendering, giving "rulers, lords, and nobles." "Pekod" appears as a place in Jeremiah I. 20 (compare Schrader's 'Cuneiform Inscriptions,' 2. pp. 32, 117,120, where Shoa and Koa are identified with Medo-Elamite tribes east of the Tigris), but the ether names are unknown to history. On the whole, the balance seems in favor of the rendering in the text. With these are joined <span class="cmt_word">all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Assyrians</span>, who, under Nebuchadnezzar, fought, of course, in his armies." Now she should see <span class="cmt_word">her</span> <span class="cmt_word">desirable young men... riding upon horses</span> (the prophet repeats with sarcasm the phrase of Ver. 12) in another guise than she had expected.

Possibly it may have been known to Ezekiel as a punishment for the adulterer or adulteress in Egypt and other countries, and if so, he might have selected it as specially appropriate to his parable (Martial, 'Epigr.,' 2:83; 3:85). <span class="cmt_word">Thy residue shall be consumed with fire</span>. The Hebrew word for "residue" (not that usually so translated) is the same as that previously translated "remnant." In the first clause it clearly points to the men of Jerusalem who are left after the capture. In the second its meaning is determined by the fact that it follows after the deportation of the sons and daughters. All that was left - in the parable, of the mutilated trunk of the adulteress, in the history, of the devastated city, <span class="accented">sc</span>. the empty houses - should be destroyed by fire.

The nature of the guilt is emphasized (Vers. 38, 39) by the fact that the idolatrous ritual was performed on the very day in which the people sacrificed in the temple; that it found a local habitation even there (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34</a>).

The imagery of the earlier stage of the harlot's progress is resumed, and we have a picture almost the counterpart of that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-10.htm">Proverbs 7:10-21</a>. She takes her bath, paints her eyelashes with <span class="accented">kohol</span>, the black pigment still used in the East, as Jezebel had done (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>). She decks herself with jewels, and sits on a divan (a sofa-conch, rather than bed), and prepares a table for a banquet. And on that table are the incense and the oil, symbols alike of wealth and worship, which Jehovah claims as his, and which she offers to her lovers (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 8</a>).

"Sabeans" rests on a Jewish rendering of the text, but, as a people, the Sabeans, who dwelt south of Meroe, though named in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, were too remote to come within the horizon of the parable. What Ezekiel dwells on is the ever-growing degradation of the harlot city. Not only the officers of the Chaldeans, but the mixed multitude, the very drunkards from the wilderness of Babylon, were admitted to her embraces. Possibly the word may point to the false gods to whom libations of wine were offered, but I incline to refer it rather to those who got drunk at their idol-festivals even in Jerusalem. Drunkenness was one of the vices of the Babylonians, and the prophets, who admired the Rechabites and the Nazarites (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/35.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-11.htm">Amos 2:11</a>), must have looked on Judah's participation in that sin as a measureless degradation. <span class="cmt_word">The bracelets and crowns</span> symbolize the wealth and prestige which the Chaldean alliance was supposed to bring with it.

The text is probably corrupt, and resists conjectural emendation. In any case the general meaning is clear. The sin is of too long standing to be cured.
