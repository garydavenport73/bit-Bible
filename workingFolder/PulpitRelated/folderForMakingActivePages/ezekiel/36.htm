Vers. 1-15 belong to the "word" which opened with the first verse of the preceding chapter; ver. 16 begins another "word," which only closes at <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-14.htm">Ezekiel 37:14</a>.

This prediction must be read in contrast, first, to that delivered against the mountains of Seir in the last chapter (35.), and, secondly, to that uttered against the mountains of Israel at an earlier stage of Ezekiel's activity (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/6.htm">Ezekiel 6</a>.). That "the mountains of Israel" was a familiar expression for the land of Israel, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-1.htm">Ezekiel 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Ezekiel 38:8</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>.

The ground of Jehovah's purposed proceeding against Edom and the surrounding heathen peoples (vers. 3, 5) is expressly declared to be the jubilation over the downfall of Israel, and the eagerness with which they sought to appropriate to themselves her forsaken land. <span class="cmt_word">Aha</span>! Exulting over Israel's misfortune (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-3.htm">Ezekiel 25:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-16.htm">Psalm 40:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ancient high places</span>, which Israel's enemies fancied had become theirs in possession, were probably "the everlasting hills" of <a href="../../par/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>, the principal mountains of Palestine, which, as Havernick finely observes, were "the honorable witnesses and indestructible monuments of that ancient blessing spoken by Israel's ancestor, and still resting on the people;" and to assail which was, in consequence, not only to sin against Jehovah, but to attempt an enterprise foredoomed to failure and shame. At the same time, Plumptre's suggestion ('Ezekiel: an Ideal Biography,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 8:284; and Unpublished Notes) is not without plausibility, that, considering the special significance of the term bamoth in Ezekiel, the phrase should be held as referring to the sanctuaries which stood upon those heights - including, of course, the chief sanctuary, or temple (Schroder); in support of which the dean cites the frequency with which the enemies of Israel, as, for instance, the Assyrians and the Moabites, in their inscriptions, boasted that they had captured these sanctuaries (see 'Records of the Past,' 2nd series, tel. 1. p. 107; 2:203).

Ewald calls attention to the fivefold repetition of this conjunction, saying, "It repeats itself five times, the reasons [for God's judgments] against these enemies thrusting themselves forward, before the discourse calmly dwells upon the mountains of Israel, of which it is strictly intended to treat." As it were, the prophet's emotion is so strong, and his indignation against Israel's enemies so vehement, that, though he three times in succession begins to prophesy to the mountains of Israel, he on each occasion breaks off before he can get his message told, to expatiate upon the wickedness of Israel's foes. In the prophet's estimation that wickedness was so heinous as to inevitably carry in its bosom appropriate retribution. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> - literally, <span class="accented">because and because</span>, or <span class="accented">even because</span>, a reduplication for the sake of emphasis, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> - <span class="cmt_word">they have made you desolate</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and swallowed you up on every side</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wasting of and panting after you</span> (are) <span class="accented">round about</span>.

Keil sees in "the tongue" a personification for the "tongue-man" or talker of <a href="../../par/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a>; and Gesenius considers the two clauses as tautological.

"The law [of retribution] is demanded by the absolute righteousness of God. The judicial visitations of God cannot possibly be one-sided. Punishment can so much the less strike Israel alone, as precisely in its punishment the deep degradation of heathendom, its apostasy from God and its pride, has set itself forth in the most striking way" (Havernick). The certainty that this law would operate in the case of the heathen no less than in that of Israel, the prophet expresses by representing Jehovah as <span class="cmt_word">having lifted up his hand</span>, or sworn that it should be so (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5, 6, 15, 23, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; and Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:195, "Teaditque ad sidera dextram").

Keil and Plumptre make the subject of the verb the material blessings in which Israel's prosperity is depicted as consisting, viz. the foliage and fruit her mountains were soon to bear for the people of Jehovah. The majority of expositors believe the subject to be the people whose return from exile was in this way declared to be approaching. Nor is there any reason why Ezekiel should not have represented the return from exile as an event soon to take place, since of the seventy years of captivity predicted by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>) at least twenty years had passed, if its commencement be dated from the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>); and the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise was to the prophet so much a matter of certainty (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>) that his fervent imagination conceived it as at hand.

The charge preferred against the country by her enemies was that she had been a land that devoured men and "bereaved its nations" (or, "nation," Revised Version); literally, <span class="accented">an eater-up of men and a bereaver of thy nations; i.e.</span> of Israel and Judah, perhaps also of the Canaanites, their predecessors (Fausset), the image being that of a wild beast which ravages the population and makes them childless, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a> and Ezekiel 14:15 (Smend), rather than that of an unnatural mother, a <span class="accented">Rabenmutter</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-29.htm">2 Kings 6:29</a>, who devours her offspring (Ewald). This charge, in which, perhaps, the prophet detected an allusion to <a href="../../par/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a>, had certainly in times past been true; not, however, as Hengstenberg suggests, because the land had been "an apple of discord for the Asiatic and African powers," or, as Ewald explains, because "the tremendous restlessness, the excited push and hurry of such a mentally active city must in any case have used up its inhabitants more rapidly;" but, as Keil, Plumptre, and others interpret, because of the judgments of sword, famine, and pestilence sent upon the land by Jehovah for its sins. These judgments had so destroyed its inhabitants, first the Canaanites, and latterly the two peoples of Israel and Judah, that "those who looked upon it deemed it a fatal land, which brought destruction to all who should occupy it" (Currey). In the golden age to which the prophet looked forward, no such reproach should be possible. Not only should the laud not bereave its nations (according to the Keri, followed by the Authorized and Revised Versions, as well as by Ewald and Smend), but (according to the Chethib, preferred by Keil, Kliefoth, Havernick, Heugstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre) it should not even cause them (or it) to stumble; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> should no more cause its inhabitants to lapse into those sins, amongst which idolatry stood prominent, which entailed on them ruin. Hengstenberg's idea, that "moral stumbling is not to be thought of in this connection," is certainly to be rejected. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a></div><div class="verse">Neither will I cause <i>men</i> to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I cause men to hear in thee</span> - <span class="accented">let thee hear</span>, <span class="accented">proclaim against thee</span> (Revised Version); or literally, <span class="accented">cause to be heard against thee - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the shame of the heathen any more</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the contemptuous speech uttered against thee by the heathen, equivalent to <span class="cmt_word">the reproach of the people</span>; or, <span class="accented">peoples; i.e.</span> the reproach cast upon thee by the nations (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-57.htm">Ezekiel 16:57</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-4.htm">Ezekiel 22:4</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>), rather than, as Curtsy suggests, the reproach cast upon thee by thy rightful possessors for want of fertility. This prophecy clearly looked beyond the return from exile under Zerubbabel and Joshua, Ezra and Neherajah, since under these leaders only a portion of the whole house of Israel re<span class="accented">established</span> themselves in Canaan, while the land was often afterwards subjected to reproach and oppression under heathen powers. At the same time, the homecoming from Babylon and the prosperity that ensued thereupon were partial fulfillments of the <span class="accented">blessings</span> here promised.

Their ways and doings, i.e. their violent deeds and idolatrous practices (ver. 18), were as morally loathsome in Jehovah's sight as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation was materially disgusting. The comparison may have been derived from <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, but was as likely to have been original, seeing Ezekiel was a priest-prophet, to whom the details of the Levitical Law must have been familiar (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>).

As a woman in her separation was not only defiled, but separated from the congregation <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>), so Israel, having defiled both herself and her land, required to be removed from it (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>). And she was. Jehovah scattered her among the heathen and dispersed her through the countries. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a></div><div class="verse">And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These <i>are</i> the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They profaned my holy Name</span>; or, <span class="accented">the name of my holiness</span>. According to Kliefoth, the subject of the verb is "the heathen," but expositors generally regard it as "the house of Israel" of ver. 17. Plumptre thinks that "while grammatically the words may refer to either the heathen or the exiles of Israel, possibly the sentence was purposely left vague, so as to describe the fact in which both were sharers," and cites in support of this view similar constructions in <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>. What led to the profanation of Jehovah's Name by the heathen was the arrival among them, not of the news of the calamity which had befallen Israel (Kliefoth, Hengstenberg), but of the house of Israel itself; and the actual profanation lay in this, that, having beheld the exiles, they said, <span class="cmt_word">These are the people of the Lord, and they are gone forth out of his land.</span> As the heathen recognized only local divinities, they concluded Jehovah had either behaved capriciously towards his people and east them off (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>), or had proved unequal to the task of protecting them so that they had been driven off (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). In either case, the honor of Jehovah had been lessened in the minds  and tarnished by the words of the heathen, and inasmuch as this result had been brought about by Israel's sin, on Israel properly the blame lay. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a></div><div class="verse">But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had pity for mille holy Name</span>. Havernick, after the LXX., wrongly renders, "I spared (them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Israel) for my holy Name s sake; but the preposition for or "upon" following the verb usually marks the object upon which the action of the verb terminates (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a>). Gesenius translates, "I will be sparing of my holy Name;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will care for its honor.

Thus Jehovah repudiates the claim of merit on Israel's part (comp. ver. 32); and if Israel had no claim on Jehovah for deliverance from the Babylonish exile any more than she had at first to be put in possession of Canaan (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>), much less has fallen man a claim on God for salvation from the condemnation and dominion of sin (<a href="../../par/romans/11-6.htm">Romans 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>). As the essential holiness and righteousness of God were the real reason of Israel's exile and dispersion among the nations, so were these qualities in God the ultimate grounds to which Israel's recovery and restoration should be traced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a></div><div class="verse">And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify my great Name</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the name of my holiness (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>). As Israel's dispersion had caused that Name to be profaned, so Israel's restoration would secure that it should be magnified among the heathen (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>), who should learn from this event that their previous ideas of Jehovah, as a feeble and local divinity, had been wrong. The question whether your eyes, as in the Hebrew text, or "their eyes," as in many ancient versions, should be read is debated. The latter reading appears to be demanded by the <span class="accented">usus</span> <span class="accented">loquendi</span> of Ezekiel (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-27.htm">Ezekiel 39:27</a>), and is adopted by both English versions as well as by interpreters of eminence; but other expositors of equal name adhere to the former reading on the ground that the sanctifying of Jehovah's Name in the eyes of Israel was an indispensable preliminary to its sanctification in the eyes of the heathen. Havernick regards "their eyes" as "an obvious emendation to relieve a difficulty," to which in no case should criticism accord the preference; while Keil gives it the preference, though admitting that "your eyes" can be justified. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a></div><div class="verse">For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will take you from among the heathen</span>; or, <span class="accented">nations</span>. The first step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name. A promise already given (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41, 42</a>), and afterwards repeated (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>). The mention of "all countries" shows the prophet's gaze to have been directed beyond the present or immediate future. The Israel of Ezekiel's time had not been scattered among and could not be gathered from all, countries; yet in the years that have passed since then Ezekiel's language as to Israel's dispersion has been literally fulfilled. Wherefore the inference is reasonable that the reassembling to which Ezekiel refers is an event that has not yet occurred, at least in its fullest measure and degree, but will only then be realized completely and finally when the scattered members of the house of Israel shall have been received into the Christian Church (<a href="../../par/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25, 26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a></div><div class="verse">Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I will sprinkle clean water upon you</span>. The second step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name, and one absolutely necessary to render the preceding either permanent or valuable, was the moral renovation of the people; and in this the first stage was the forgiveness of the people's sins. The image under which this is set forth, "sprinkling with clean water," would naturally present itself to a priest-prophet such as Ezekiel. Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, and others suppose the allusion to be to the water of purification prepared by mixing running water with the ashes of a red heifer (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-17.htm">Numbers 19:17-19</a>), and in the account given of this rite the verb for "sprinkle" is that used by Ezekiel, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>. Havernick prefers the rite performed in the consecration of the Levites (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-7.htm">Numbers 8:7, 21</a>). Smend, who holds the priest-code had no existence in Ezekiel's day, traces the image to <a href="../../par/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a> or <a href="../../par/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>, though he also cites <a href="../../par/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>. Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Currey think of the lustrations of the Law in general; and perhaps this best explains the prophet's language, since the element sprinkled is not "blood" or "water mixed with ashes," but "clean water," "the best known means of purification" (Schroder). As to whether legal or moral cleansing were intended by the prophet, possibly Ezekiel drew no sharp distinction between the two, such as the New Testament draws between justification and sanctification; if he did, then the figure in the text must be taken as alluding rather to the former than to the latter - rather to the forgiveness of Israel's sin than to the regeneration of Israel's heart, which is next referred to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a></div><div class="verse">A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.</span> The third step in the progress of sanctifying Jehovah's Name (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, where a similar promise is made, and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>, where the new heart is represented as a thing Israel must make for herself). This antinomy frequently occurs in Scripture, which never shrinks from holding man responsible for the production of that, as e.g. faith, for which he is incompetent without the help of Divine grace. Besides the cleansing of her guilt and her restitution in consequence to Jehovah's favor, Israel is promised such an inward renovation of her moral and spiritual disposition as to secure that she shall in future adhere to the worship and service of Jehovah. This change is described in a fourfold way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Negatively</span>, as a removal of the old, stony, unsusceptible heart, which had remained impervious to all appeals and insertsible to all higher feelings (<a href="../../par/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Positively</span>, as a new heart and a new spirit, called elsewhere "one heart" and "a heart of flesh" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a>), "a heart to know God" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Causally</span>, its existence being traced to the indwelling of God's Spirit, who writes God's Law upon the new heart, and inclines it to a life of obedience thereto (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">Practically</span>, by its manifestation, walking in God's statutes and keeping God s judgments (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>).

As the Jews who returned from Babylon did not permanently dwell in the land, but were again ejected from it, the promise contained in these words must be viewed as having been conditional on the realization of the moral and spiritual purity above described.

That this view is correct is vouched for by the fact that the words, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall be my people and I will be your God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>: <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-22.htm">Jeremiah 30:22</a>), descriptive of the covenant relationship in which Jehovah stood towards Israel (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17, 18</a>), have been chosen by New Testament writers to set forth the relationship of God towards the Christian Church, first here on earth (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-18</a>), and afterwards in the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).

In answer to their prayers, he engages, going back to the language of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-22.htm">Ezekiel 34:22</a>, <span class="cmt_word">to increase them with men like a flock</span> - incorrectly rendered by Kliefoth to "multiply them so that they shall become the flock of mankind." Thus he meets the despondency of those among the exiles <span class="accented">who</span>, fixing their attention on the small number of them who should form the new Israel - those who should return with those, perhaps, who still remained in the land-could not see how Israel's future prosperity was to be secured.

Josephus, 'Wars,' 6:9. 3). Perhaps in addition to the idea of the multiplication of the people, that of their dedication to the service of Jehovah is suggested by the prophet's language. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/35.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 35"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 35" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/37.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 37"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 37" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
