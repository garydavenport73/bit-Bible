He will run thus: <span class="accented">into the coasts</span> (<span class="accented">borders</span>) <span class="accented">of Judaea and beyond Jordan. Our</span> Lord was now on his last progress towards Jerusalem. It would appear from St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>) that in the earlier part of his journey he touched the frontier of Samaria. Putting the accounts together, we conclude that, being refused by the Samaritans, he passed eastwards along their frontier, having Galilee on his left, and Samaria on his right; and then crossed the Jordan, perhaps at Scythopolis, where was a bridge, and so entered Peraea. As Judaea and Galilee both lay west of the Jordan, this route above described would be literally coming "to the borders of Judaea and beyond Jordan." Again multitudes flocked together to him, and again he taught them. St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>) says that "he healed them." His miracles of healing and his teaching went hand in hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-2.htm">Mark 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away <i>his</i> wife? tempting him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came unto him Pharisees</span> - the article should be omitted - <span class="cmt_word">and asked him</span> - they came forward before the people, and publicly questioned him - <span class="cmt_word">Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?</span> St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3</a>) adds to the question the words, "for every cause." There were causes for which it was lawful. They put this question to our Lord, <span class="cmt_word">tempting him</span>; of course with an evil intent. This question about divorce was one which was much agitated in the time of our Lord. In the century before Christ, a learned rabbi, named Hillel, a native of Babylon, who afterwards came to Jerusalem, studied the Law with great success, and became the head of the chief school in that city. One of his disciples, named Shammai, separated from his master, and set up another school; so that in the time of our Lord the scribes and doctors of the Law were ranged in two parties, namely, the followers of Hillel, the most influential; and the followers of Shammai. These two schools differed widely on the subject of divorce. The followers of Shammai only permitted divorce in the case of moral defilement, while the followers of Hillel placed the matter entirely in the power of the husband. The object, therefore, of this artful question was to entrap our Lord, and to bring him into collision with one or other of these two opposing parties. For if he had said that it was not lawful for a man to put away his wife, he would have exposed himself to the hostility of many of the wealthy classes, who put away their wives for any cause. But if he had allowed the lawfulness of divorce at all, they would have found fault with his doctrine as imperfect and carnal, although he professed to be a spiritual Teacher of a perfect system, sent down from heaven. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-3.htm">Mark 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he answered and</span> said <span class="cmt_word">unto them, What did Moses command you?</span> They professed much reverence for Moses;   he therefore appeals to their great lawgiver<span class="cmt_word">. And they said, Moses suffered to write</span> <span class="cmt_word">a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.</span> If we now turn to St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4, 5</a>). He we shall find that our Lord then appeals to the original institution of marriage. "Have ye not read, that he which made them from the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh? So that they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." He thus reminds them that marriage is a Divine institution; that as Adam and Eve were united by him in a union which was indissoluble, therefore he intended that the marriage bond should remain ever, so that the wife ought never to be separated from her husband, since she becomes by marriage a very part of her husband. To this purpose St. Augustine says ('City of God,' bk. 14:22). He "It was not of the spirit which commands and the body which obeys, nor of the rational soul which rules and the irrational desire which is ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme, and the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the mind and the sense of the body; but plainly of the matrimonial union, by which the sexes are mutually bound together, that our Lord, when asked whether it were lawful for any cause to put away one's wife, answered as in St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4, 5</a>). It is certain, then, that from the first men were created as we see and know them to be now, of two sexes - male and female - and that they are called one, either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of the origin of the woman, who was created from out of the side of the man."

Our Lord here answers their question, <span class="cmt_word">For your</span> <span class="cmt_word">hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.</span> He permitted (not commanded) them to put away their wives, lest dislike might turn to hatred. From the beginning God joined them in one indissoluble bend; but man's nature having become corrupt through sin, that sin changed and corrupted the institution, and so was the occasion of bills of divorcement, and polygamy. The Law of Moses put some restraint upon the freedom with which men had till then put away their wives; for thenceforth, a divorce could not take place until some legal steps had been taken, and a regular instrument had been drawn up; and this delay might often be the means of preventing a divorce which might otherwise have been effected in a moment of passion. Thus this legislation was adapted to the imperfect moral condition of the people, who were as yet quite unprepared for a higher moral code.

But it would appear from St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>) that our Lord had already said this in public; so that here he proclaims a new law, or rather affirms the sanctions of the primitive institution, abrogating the "bill of divorcement" excepting in the one case of fornication, and restoring the rite of marriage to its primaeval and indissoluble character. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Committeth adultery against</span> <span class="cmt_word">her</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>). This must surely mean the wife that has been put away. The adultery is against her, against her rights and interests. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-12.htm">Mark 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - This verse should be read thus: <span class="cmt_word">And if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This reading is well supported. These words indicate that, according to our blessed Lord's teaching, wives and husbands have equal rights in reference to divorce; and so the Greek, according to the best authorities, is (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>) "shall marry," not (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>) "shall be married." Josephus, however, makes it evident that in his time husband and wife had by no means equal rights in these matters ('Antiq.' 15:7, 10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and <i>his</i> disciples rebuked those that brought <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - It is worthy of notice that this touching incident follows here, as well as in the parallel passage in St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>). He immediately after the discourse about the marriage bond. <span class="cmt_word">And they brought unto him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) - literally, were <span class="accented">bringing - <span class="cmt_word"></span>little children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) - St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/18-15.htm">Luke 18:15</a>) calls them "babes" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">he should touch them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). St. Luke has the same word (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); but St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>) says "that he should lay his hands on them and pray." The imposition of hands implies a formal benediction; the invoking of Divine grace upon them, that they might grow up into wise and holy men and women. Why did the disciples rebuke them? Perhaps because they thought it unworthy of so great a Prophet, whose business was rather that of instructing those of full age, to be spending his time upon little children. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-14.htm">Mark 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">But when Jesus saw <i>it</i>, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">when Jesus saw</span> it (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Greek shows that there was no interval between the acts of the parents  and the disciples, and our Lord's seeing it. The parents were bringing the children, the disciples were rebuking them, Jesus was perceiving. <span class="cmt_word">He was much displeased</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">he was moved with indignation</span>. His words imply eagerness and earnestness: <span class="cmt_word">Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not</span>. The copulative <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> is not to be found in the best authorities. The omission adds force and vividness to the words. The simplicity, candour, and innocence of little children are very attractive. This narrative shows with what care children should be educated. <span class="cmt_word">For of such is the kingdom</span> <span class="cmt_word">of God;</span> that is, of such little children as these. The kingdom of heaven belongs in a peculiar manner to little children. We know for certain that little children who have been brought to Christ in Holy Baptism, if they die before they are old enough for moral accountableness, are undoubtedly saved. They pass at once into a nearer position to the throne. "They are without fault before the throne of God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-15.htm">Mark 10:15</a></div><div class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein</span>. Observe the "verily" with which our Lord introduces these words. He here adds something which extends what he has just said to those who are, not literally, but figuratively, little children. We must first receive the kingdom into our affections before we can really enter into it. It is as though Christ said, "It is not unworthy of my dignity to take little children into my arms and bless them, because by my benediction they become fit for the kingdom of heaven. And if you full-grown men would become fit for my kingdom, you must give up your ambitious aims and earthly contests, and imitate the simple unworldly ways of little children. The simplicity of the little child is the model and the rule for every one who desires, by the grace of Christ, to obtain the kingdom of heaven. Our Lord's whole action here is a great encouragement to the receiving of little children by Holy Baptism into covenant with him.

The word rendered "taking in the arms" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) has already occurred in this Gospel at Mark 9:36 (where see the note). The description here is very graphic. Our Savior would first embrace the little child,. He folding it in his arms; then he would lay his right hand upon the child's head, and bless it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17</a></div><div class="verse">And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This verse should be rendered, <span class="cmt_word">And as he was going forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) - that is, just as he was leaving the house <span class="cmt_word">- there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him.</span> St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-20.htm">Matthew 21:20</a>) says that he was "a young man." St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/18-18.htm">Luke 18:18</a>) that he was "a ruler." He had apparently been waiting for our Lord, waylaying him, though with a good intention. He showed zeal - as soon as he saw Jesus he ran to him; and he showed reverence, for he kneeled down to him. He wanted advice from one whom he must have heard of as a celebrated Teacher; and he wanted this counsel as a matter of great interest to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Good Master</span>. This would be the ordinary and courteous mode of accosting a person professing to be a teacher, so as to conciliate his attention and interest. <span class="cmt_word">What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</span> It is as though he said, "Rabbi, I know thee to be good, both as a man and as a teacher, and a prophet, well able to teach me perfectly those things which are really good, and which lead to blessedness hereafter. Tell me, therefore, What shall I do?" St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) says, "What good thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>) shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-18.htm">Mark 10:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? <i>there is</i> none good but one, <i>that is</i>, God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why callest</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou me good</span>? According to the best authorities, the words in St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) run thus: "Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good." The word "good" is the pivot on which our Lord's answer turns, both in St. Matthew and here. The question is doubtless put to test the young ruler's faith. If, as may be supposed, the young man used the term, "good Master," as a mere conventional expression, it was not the proper epithet to apply to our Lord, who at once transfers the praise and the goodness to God, that he might teach us to do the same. This ruler, by his mode of accosting our Lord, showed that he had not as yet a right faith in him - that he did not believe in his Godhead. Our Lord, therefore, desired to rouse him and lift him up to a higher faith. He seems to say to him, "If you call me good, believe that I am God; for no one is good, intrinsically good, but God. God alone is essentially good, and wise, and powerful, and holy. It is from him that angels and men derive a few drops, or rather some faint adumbration, of his goodness. There is none essentially, entirely, absolutely good but one, that is, God. Therefore seek after him, love him, imitate him. He alone can satisfy your longing desires, as in this life with his grace, so in the life to come with his glory; yea, with himself. For in heaven he manifested himself as the supreme good, to be tasted and enjoyed by the blessed for ever."

It will be observed that it is upon the commandments of the second table that our Lord here lays stress. For the love of God produces the love of our neighbor; and he who loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

The counsel of our Lord which follows was not a general command, but a particular precept, which the young ruler specially needed. <span class="cmt_word">One thing thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">lackest</span>. In St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>) the words are, "If thou wouldest be perfect." But our Lord's words here, "One thing thou lackest," fit in excellently with the young ruler's question given just before in St. Matthew, "What lack I yet?" showing a substantial unity in the narrative, with just that variety which we should expect in the account of the same incident given by two independent but equally trustworthy witnesses. The "one thing thou lackest" of St. Mark, and "if thou writ be perfect of St. Matthew, both point to the same conclusion - that our Lord's object was to reveal this young man to himself. His stumbling-block was his wealth; and so our Savior at once pierces his besetting sin of covetousness. The precept was a special counsel to him; it directed him to do something which, as our Lord saw, was in his case necessary to his salvation. He could not follow Christ without parting with this sin, and with that which ministered to it. This was his particular spiritual difficulty.

Our Lord turned from the young man, who was now going away, and looked round about, no doubt with a sad and disappointed look, and said to his disciples, <span class="cmt_word">How hardly shall they that have riches enter into</span> <span class="cmt_word">the kingdom of God!</span> Why is this? Partly because the love of riches tempts men to heap them up, whether lawfully or unlawfully. Partly because the love of riches binds the soul to earth, so that it is less likely to think of Partly because riches are an incentive to pride and luxury and other sins. The heathen poet Ovid could speak of riches "irritamenta malorum." Poverty and contempt of riches often open that heaven which wealth and covetousness close.

He and takes off somewhat of the edge of the seventy of the expression, by changing the form of it into the words," how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" There is some authority for omitting the words. "for them that trot in riches;" so to reduce the sentence to the simple form, "How hard is it to enter into the kingdom of God!" Such is the reading in the two great uncial manuscripts, the Sinaitic and the Vatican. But on the whole the balance of evidence is in favor of that which was adopted in the Authorized Version, and has been retained by the Revisers of 1881; and it is reasonable to believe that our Lord qualified the former expression, in order to relieve the minds of his amazed disciples.

Dr. John Lightfoot, in his Hebrew exercitations upon St. Matthew's Gospel (vol. 2 p. 219). He quotes instances from the binical writings of a very similar phrase intended to represent something that is  possible. For example, he quotes one rabbi disputing with another, who says, "Perhaps thou art one of those who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle; that i,s, "who speak things that are impossible.' St. Jerome says," It is not the absolute impossibility of the thing which is set forth, but the infrequency of it."

The Greek verb implies an earnest, intense looking upon them; evidently narrated by one who, like Peter, had watched his countenance. St. Chrysostom says that he looked on them in this way that he might mitigate and soothe the timid and anxious minds of his disciples. It is as though our Lord said, "It is impossible for a rich man, embarrassed and entangled with his wealth, by his own natural strength to obtain salvation; because this is a supernatural blessing, which we cannot obtain without the like supernatural aids of grace. But with God all things are possible, because God is the Author and Source, as of nature, so of grace and glory. And he enables us, by his grace, to triumph over all the difficulties and hindrances of nature; so that rich men shall not be hindered by their riches; but, by being faithful in the unrighteous mammon, shall make it the means of their being received unto 'the eternal tabernacle.'"

He had been thinking of himself and his companions, the other disciples.. He in reference to these last words of our Lord. It is probable that the sacrifice which Peter and the rest of the disciples had made when they became his followers, was small, compared with the sacrifice which our Lord demanded of the rich young ruler. Nevertheless they forsook their all, whatever it was. They had forsaken their boats and their nets. They had forsaken their means of subsistence. They had forsaken things which, though they were not much in themselves, were nevertheless such things as they would have desired to keep. Cornelins a Lapide says, "Such things are forsaken by those who follow Christ, as are capable of being desired by those who do not follow him." St. Augustine says, "St. Peter not only forsook what he had, but also what he desired to have. But who does not desire daily to increase what he has? That desire is cut off. Peter forsook the whole world, and he received in return the whole world. They were as those who had nothing, and yet were possessing all things." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-29.htm">Mark 10:29</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>) here introduces the great promise, to be fulfilled in the regeneration, that is, at the second coming of Christ - at the second birth of the world to a new and glorious state. It may be that St. Matthew was guided to record it, inasmuch as his Gospel was written for Jews. Its omission by St. Mark and St. Luke may be explained by the fact that they were writing, the one to Romans, and the other to Gentiles generally. Omitting further notice here of this great promise recorded only by St. Matthew, St. Mark's words seem general, common to all faithful Christians. This leaving, of house, or <span class="cmt_word">brethren</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">sisters</span>, etc., might be rendered necessary from various causes. But they are all covered by that one expression, <span class="cmt_word">for my sake, and for the gospel's</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a></div><div class="verse">But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>) says (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) "manifold more" - an indefinite increase, to show the greatness and multitude of the recompense. He who forsakes his own for the sake of Christ will find others, many in number, who will give him the love of brethren and sisters, with even greater affection; so that he will seem not to have lost or forsaken his own, but to have received them again with interest. For spiritual affections are far deeper than natural; and his love is stronger who burns with heavenly love which God has kindled, than he who is influenced by earthly love only, which only nature has planted. But in the fullest sense, he who forsakes these earthly things for the sake of Christ, receives instead, God himself. For to those who forsake all for him, he is himself father, brother, sister, and all things. So that he will have possessions far richer than what earth can supply; only <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">persecutions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is a very striking addition. Our Lord here includes "persecutions" in the number of the Christian's blessings. And no doubt there is a noble sense in which persecutions are really amongst the blessings of the believer. "If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>). St. Peter, who must have had in his mind the "with persecutions" of our Lord when he wrote these words, here shows that the blessedness of the Christian when suffering persecution is this, that he has a special sense of the abiding presence of the Spirit of God, bringing with it the assurance of future glory. "Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: far great is your reward in heaven." The  words are also, of course, a warning to the disciples as to the persecutions that awaited them. And in the world to come eternal life. This is that splendid inheritance in which the blessed shall be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; and so shall possess not only the heaven and the earth, and all things that are in them, but even God himself, and all honor, all glory, all joy, not merely as occupiers, but as heirs for ever; as long as God himself shall be, who is himself "the eternal God."

Most fitly does our Lord add this weighty sentence to what has just gone before. For thus he places himself, his grace, and his gospel in direct opposition to the corrupt teaching of the scribes and Pharisees. Perhaps the disciples thought within themselves, "How can it come to pass that we, the poor, the unlearned, the despised, are to sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel, amongst whom are men far our superiors in station, in learning, and in authority, such as are the scribes and Pharisees, and that rich young ruler just mentioned." Our Lord here teaches them that the future will reveal great changes - that some who are first here will be last there, and some who seem last here will be first there. The disciples, and others like them, who, having forsaken all and followed Christ, seemed to be last in this world, will be first in the world to come - most dear to Christ, the King of Heaven, in their lives; most like to him in their zeal for his cause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32</a></div><div class="verse">And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.

He went before them, eagerly leading the way for his timid disciples, who were now beginning to realize what was about to happen, and that he would be condemned and crucified. Therefore the evangelist adds, <span class="cmt_word">they were amazed</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); the same word which is used at ver. 24. The words in the original, according to the best reading, make a distinction between the utter amazement of the disciples and the fear of the others who followed (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). St. Mark draws a distinction between the disciples, who would be following him, though at a little distance, and the mixed company, who were also following him, though at a greater distance. The whole scene is before us. Our blessed Lord, with an awful majesty on his countenance, and eager resolution in his manner, is pressing forwards to his cross. "How am I straitened until it be accomplished!" His disciples follow him, amazed and bewildered; and even the miscellaneous crowd, who no doubt gazed upon him with keen interest as the great "Prophet that should come into the world," felt that something was going to happen, though they knew not what - some-thing very dreadful; and they too were afraid. In the case of the disciples, Bede says that the chief cause of their amazement was their own imminent fear of death. They were amazed that their Master should hasten forward with such alacrity to his cross, and they feared lest they too should have to suffer with him. <span class="cmt_word">He took</span> <span class="cmt_word">again</span> <span class="cmt_word">the twelve</span>; and once more impressed upon them the dread realities which were awaiting him. They were still slow of apprehension; they required to be told again and again.

The two accounts are readily reconciled if we consider that the request was made by Salome and her sons, and by her in their behalf. This request was made by them not long after they had heard our Lord's great promise that his apostles "in the regeneration" should "sit upon thrones," judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). He and very soon after they had heard his repeated announcement of his sufferings and death. But the thought of the glory which was to follow swallowed up the thought of the suffering that was to precede it; and so these two disciples were emboldened at once to ask for prominent positions amongst the thrones. St. Chrysostom finds an excuse for the imperfection of their faith. He says, "The mystery of the cross was not yet accomplished; nor yet was the grace of the Holy Spirit poured into their hearts. Wherefore, if you desire to know the strength of their faith, consider what they became after they had been endued with power from on high."

Our Lord here describes his passion as his cup. The "cup" everywhere in Holy Scripture, as well as in profane writers, signifies a man's portion, which is determined for him by God, and sent to him. The figure is derived from the ancient custom at feasts, by which the ruler of the feast tempered the wine according to his own will, and appointed to each guest his own portion, which it was his duty to drink. Our Lord then proceeds to describe his passion, which he had already spoken of as his cup, as his baptism. He uses this image because he would be totally buried, immersed, so to speak, in his passion. But it seems probable that the idea of <span class="accented">purification</span> entered into this image. It was a baptism of fire into which he was plunged, and out of which he came forth victorious. The fire of his bitter passion and death tried him. It was his "salting with fire." It pleased God thus to "make the Captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings." Our Lord asks these ambitious disciples whether they could drink his cup of suffering, and be baptized with his fiery baptism.

They both of them drank the cup, though in different ways. St. James, preaching Christ more boldly and fervently, became an early martyr, having been slain by the sword of Herod (<a href="../../par/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>). St. John also drank of this cup, and was baptized with this baptism, when, if we may trust the authority of Tertullian ('De Praescript.' c. 36.). He he was cast by order of Domitian into a caldron of boiling oil, before the Porta Latina at Rome, although the oil had no power to hurt him. Another legend states that he drank a cup of poison, and took no harm. On this account he is frequently represented with a cup in his hand.

The Arians gathered from this that our Lord was not of one substance with the Father. But this arose from a misunderstanding of the words. For the antithesis is not here between Christ and the Father; but between James and John on the one side ambitiously seeking the pre-eminence, and those on the ether side to whom it ought of right to be given. St. Jerome wisely says, "Our Lord does not say, 'Ye shall not sit,' lest he should put to shame these two. Neither does he say, 'Ye shall sit,' lest the others should be envious. But by holding out the prize to all, he animates all to contend for it." Our Lord is also careful to point out that he who humbles himself shall be exalted. But Christ is the Giver, not indeed by way of favor to any one who asks, but according to the eternal and unalterable principles laid down by the Father. That Christ is the Giver is plain from St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-29.htm">Luke 22:29</a>). "I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me."

It is most likely that Salome and her two sons sought this favor secretly from Christ, lest they should excite the envy of the ethers. But they, the ten, must have noticed the approach of James and John with their mother to our Lord. They came in a formal manner, worshipping him first, and then making their request (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20</a>). The ten would naturally be desirous to know the nature of this interview; and when it was explained to them, they began to show indignation. Our Lord perceived that they were disputing; and he then called them and addressed the whole body. For he saw that they were all laboring under this disease of ambition; and he wished to apply the remedy at once to all, as we see in the words which follow. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42</a></div><div class="verse">But Jesus called them <i>to him</i>, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - In these words our Lord does not find fault with that power or authority, whether civil or ecclesiastical, which is exercised by princes or bishops; for this is necessary in every state, and so is sanctioned by Divine and human law. What he condemns is the arbitrary and tyrannical exercise of such power, which the princes of the Gentiles were accustomed to.

At the same time, our Lord here teaches all alike, whether superiors or inferiors, by what way we should strive to reach heaven, so as to sit at the right or left hand of Christ in his kingdom, namely, by the way of humility. For those who are the lowliest and most humble here will be the greatest and most exalted there.

Not  that Christ died only for the elect. For Christ died for all; and has obtained for all the means necessary and sufficient for their salvation. Yet the fruit of his death and his full salvation comes only to those who persevere to the end. When our Lord says that he came "to give his life a ransom for many," he regards the vast multitude of those who are included within his purposes of mercy. He "is the Savior of all men, specially of them that believe." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a></div><div class="verse">And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they come to Jericho</span>. Jericho, situated in the midst of a fertile, well-watered country, celebrated for its palm trees, was situated about seventeen English miles east-north-east of Jerusalem, and about six miles from the nearest bend of the river Jordan. In the time of our Lord it was one of the most important cities next to Jerusalem. It is now known by the name of Richa or Ericha, and is almost deserted. The journey from the Jordan to Jericho is through a fiat country; but that from Jericho to Jerusalem is very hilly. It is supposed that it was upon the rocky heights overhanging this city that our Lord's temptation took place. Jericho derives its name, either from "the moon," or from the fragrant edours of the "balsam" plant, which was extensively cultivated in the neighborhood. Its palm groves and balsam gardens were bestowed by Anthony upon Cleopatra, from whom Herod the Great purchased them. It was here that Herod the Great died. It is now one of the most filthy and neglected places in Palestine. To this place our Lord came; and St. Luke (18 and 19.) gives a full account of his reception there. St. Matthew speaks of two blind men; but he agrees with St. Mark in saying that the cure took place as he went out from Jericho. St. Luke mentions only one; but he places the cure at the time of our Lord's entrance into Jericho. How do we reconcile St. Mark's account of one only, specially named, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus? St. Augustine says that there were two blind men; but that the one, better known, overshadowed the other. He also says that Bartimaeus was a well-known character, and that he was accustomed to sit by the wayside, not only blind, but as a beggar. It is of course possible that St. Luke may refer to another ease altogether. But on the other hand, with the exception that he mentions only one, and that he places the cure at the time of the entrance into Jericho, and not at the time of the departure, all the other circumstances are identical. May not this latter discrepancy be reconciled thus? - the blind man may have sought a cure from Christ at his first entrance into the city; but he may not have been able to be heard on account of the crowd. Or our Lord may have passed him by at first, in order to stimulate his faith and hope. So the day after, he may have placed himself at the gate of the city, close by where Christ would pass through; and there again he may have urged his request, and so obtained healing. Dr. John Lightfoot (p. 348) says that the careful description of Bartimaeus would seem to imply that his father may have been a person of some note. Dr. Lightfoot adds that it is possible that Timaeus, or "Thimai," may be the same with <span class="accented">Simais</span>, blind, from the use of the letter <span class="accented">thau</span> from <span class="accented">samech</span>, common amongst the Chaldaeans; so that Bartimaeus might mean nothing more than "blind son of a blind father."

But the rebuke of the crowd gave additional energy to his entreaties; <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">he cried out the more a great deal</span>, that his voice might be heard above them all. He was in good earnest, and would not be restrained. A useful lesson is hem suggested to all. He who desires to serve God must overcome all earthly shame and fear; for, indeed, this unworthy feeling keeps back many from Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-49.htm">Mark 10:49</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus stood still</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">Jesus stood</span> - <span class="cmt_word">and said, Call ye him</span>. St. Jerome says that our Lord stood still on account of the man's infirmity. There were many walls in Jericho; there were rough places; there were rocks and precipices over which he might stumble. Therefore the Lord stood, where there was a plain path by which the blind man might approach him. The crowd show their, sympathy. There is something very genuine as well as touching in their words, <span class="cmt_word">Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-50.htm">Mark 10:50</a></div><div class="verse">And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he, casting away his garment, rose</span> - the word in the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. literally, <span class="accented">sprang to his feet - <span class="cmt_word"></span>and came to Jesus</span>. He cast away his "garment," that is, the loose outer robe which covered his tunic. He was in haste, and desired to disengage himself from every ira-pediment, in his eagerness to approach Jesus. We seem here to have the description of a keen eye-witness, such as St. Peter would be. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 51, 52.</span> - Our Lord well knew what he wanted; but it was necessary that he and those around him should hear from the lips of the blind man the confession of his need, and of his faith in the power that was present to heal him. <span class="cmt_word">And the blind man said</span>  unto him, <span class="cmt_word">Rabboni, that I may receive my sight</span>. "Rabboni," or "Rabbuni," means literally, <span class="accented">my Master</span>. It was a more respectful mode of address than the more simple form "Rabbi." This expression shows that Bartimaeus had yet much to learn as to the Divine character of our Lord. But his faith is accepted; and he showed that it was genuine as far as it went, by forthwith following Jesus in the way. There were six occasions on which our Lord is recorded to have healed the blind: St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-14.htm">Matthew 21:14</a>); St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/8-24.htm">Mark 8:24</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a>); St. John (<a href="../../par/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a>). St. Chrysostom says of Bartimaeus, that as before this gift of healing he showed perseverance, so after it he shewed gratitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
