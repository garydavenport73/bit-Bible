These words mean, not the title of the book, but the commencement of the narrative; and so they depend upon what follows, namely, "as it is written" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c2;</span>), "even as it is written." The words "the gospel of Jesus Christ" do not signify the book which St. Mark wrote, but the evangelical teaching of Jesus Christ. St. Mark means that the gospel announcement by Jesus Christ had such a beginning as had been predicted by Isaiah and Malachi, namely, the preaching of John the Baptist, and his testimony concerning Christ, to be fully laid open by the preaching and the death of Christ. The preaching of repentance by the Baptist was the preparation and the beginning of the evangelical preaching by Christ, of whom John was the forerunner. It has been well observed that St. Matthew and St. John begin their Gospels from Christ himself; but St. Matthew from the human, and St. John from the Divine, generation of Christ. St. Mark and St. Luke commence from John the Baptist; but St. Luke from his nativity, and St, John from his preaching. The words, the <span class="cmt_word">Son of God</span>, are rightly retained in the Revised Version, although they are omitted by some ancient authorities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as it is written in the prophets</span>. The weight of evidence is here in favor of the reading "in Isaiah the prophet." Three of the most important uncials (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, and L), and twenty-six of the cursives, have the reading "Isaiah." With these agree the Italic, Coptic, and Vulgate versions. Of the Fathers, Irenaeus quotes the passage three times, twice using the words "in the prophets," and once "in Isaiah the prophet." Generally the Fathers agree that "Isaiah" is the received reading. The more natural reading would of course be "in the prophets," inasmuch as two prophets are quoted; but in deciding upon readings, it constantly happens that the less likely reading is the more probable. In the case before us we can hardly account for "Isaiah" being exchanged for "the prophets," although we can quite understand "the prophets" being interpolated for "Isaiah." Assuming, then, that St. Mark wrote "in Isaiah the prophet," we may ask why he mentions Isaiah only and not Malachi? The answer would seem to be this, that here the voice of Isaiah is the more powerful of the two. But in real truth, Malachi says the same thing that Isaiah says; for the messenger sent from God to prepare the way of Christ was none other than John, crying aloud and preaching repentance as a preparation for the receiving of the grace of Christ. The oracle of Malachi is, in fact, contained in the oracle of Isaiah; for what Malachi predicted, the same had Isaiah more clearly and concisely predicted in other words. And this is the reason why St. Mark here, and other evangelists elsewhere, when they cite two prophets, and two or more sentences from different places in the same connection, cite them as one and the same testimony, each sentence appearing to be not so much two, as one and the same declaration differently worded.

John came, that is, that he might rouse the people to repentance, and prepare them, by the outward cleansing of their bodies, to receive the cleansing of their souls through Christ's baptism, which was to follow his. So that  the baptism of John was the profession of their penitence. Hence they who were baptized with his baptism confessed their sins, and thus made the first step towards the forgiving mercy which was to be found in Christ; and the seal of his forgiveness they were to look for in his baptism, which is a baptism for the remission of sins to all true penitents and faithful believers. Christ's baptism was, therefore, the perfection and consummation of the baptism of John. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-5.htm">Mark 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-6.htm">Mark 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with camel's hair</span>. This was a rough, coarse garment, characteristic of the doctrine which John taught, namely, penitence and contempt of the world. Camels abounded in Syria. <span class="cmt_word">And a leathern girdle about his loins</span>. Not only the prophets, but the Jews and the inhabitants of Syria generally, used a girdle to keep the long flowing garment more closely about them, so as to leave them more free for journeying or for labour. Thus our Lord says (<a href="../../par/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>), "Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning." <span class="cmt_word">And he did eat locusts and wild</span> <span class="cmt_word">honey.</span> The insect called the locust (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>) was permitted to be eaten (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>). It was used as food by the common people in Judaea. The Arabs eat them to this day; but they are considered as a common and inferior kind of food. They are a sign of temperance, poverty, and penitence. The wild honey (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) was simply honey made by wild bees, either in the trees or in the hollows of the rocks. Isidorus says that it was of an inferior flavour. Both these kinds of food were consistent with the austere life and the solemn preaching of the Baptist. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-7.htm">Mark 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The latchet of whose shoes I am</span> <span class="cmt_word">not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</span> This was the menial office of the slave, whose business it was to take off? and put on the shoes of his master, stooping down with all humility and respect for this purpose. Thus John confessed that he was the servant of Christ, and that Christ was his Lord. In a mystical sense the shoes denote the humanity of Christ, which by its union with the Word became of the highest dignity and majesty. St. Bernard says, "The majesty of the Word was shod with the sandal of our humanity." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with</span> [or <span class="accented">in</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the Holy Ghost</span>. It is as though he said, "Christ will pour his Holy Spirit so abundantly upon you, that he will cleanse you from all your sins, and fill you with holiness and love and all his other excellent <span class="accented">graces."</span> Christ did this visibly on the day of Pentecost. And this he does invisibly in the. sacrament of Holy Baptism, and in the rite of Confirmation, which is the completion of the sacrament of Baptism. John baptized with water only, but Christ with water and the Holy Spirit. John baptized the body only, Christ baptizes the soul. By how much, therefore, the Holy Spirit transcends the water, and the soul excels the body, by so much is Christ's baptism more excellent than that of John, which was only preparatory and rudimentary. If it be asked why it was needful that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> should be baptized with John's baptism, the best answer is that given by Christ himself, "Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh <span class="accented">us</span> to fulfill all righteousness;" it becometh us - me in receiving this baptism, and you in imparting it. Christ was sent to do the whole will of God; and as in his circumcision, so in his baptism, "he was made to be sin for us, who knew no sin."

He saw. Elsewhere we are told (<a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a>) that St. John the Baptist saw this descent. The earliest heretics took advantage of this statement to represent this event as the descent of the eternal Christ upon the man Jesus for personal indwelling. Later critics have adopted this view. But it need hardly be said here that such an opinion is altogether inconsistent with all that we read elsewhere of the circumstances of the Incarnation, and of the intimate and indissoluble union of the Divine and human natures in the person of the one Christ, from the time of the "overshadowing of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Highest." The Spirit descending upon him at his baptism was not the descent of the eternal Christ upon the man Jesus. It was rather the conveyance to one who was already prepared for it as God and man, of office and authority as the great Prophet that should come into the world. St. Luke says particularly (<a href="../../par/luke/3-21.htm">Luke 3:21</a>) that it was when Jesus had been baptized and was praying, that the Holy Spirit descended upon him; plainly showing us that it was not through the baptism of John, but through the meritorious obedience and the prayer of the Son of God, that the heavens were "rent asunder," and the Holy Spirit descended upon him.

There Christ and antichrist met, and entered upon the conflict upon the issue of which our salvation depended. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forty days tempted of Satan</span>. St. Mark gathers up the whole temptation into this one sentence; and the passage would seem to imply that the three temptations recorded by St. Matthew and St. Luke were not the only trials through which our Lord passed during those forty days, although they were no doubt the prominent and the most powerful assaults upon our Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">And he was with the wild beasts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). This shows the extreme solitude of the place. It shows also the innocence of our Lord, that there, in that wild and desolate district, amongst lions, and wolves, and leopards, and serpents, he neither feared them nor was injured by them. He dwelt amongst them as Adam lived with them in his state of innocence in Paradise. These wild beasts recognized and revered their Creater and their Lord<span class="cmt_word">. And the angels ministered unto him</span>. This, as we learn from St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>), was after his temptation and victory. Some have thought that Jesus became known to the devil as the Son of God, by the reverence and adoration of the angels. Thus Jesus showed in his own person, when alone he had striven with Satan and, had overcome him, that heavenly comfort and the ministry of angels are provided by God for those who overcome temptation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now after that John was put in prison</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, was <span class="accented">delivered up.</span> This was our Lord's second coming into Galilee. Galilee had been specially designated as the scene of the Divine manifestation (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1, 2</a>). The land of Galilee, or of Zebulun and Naphtali, had the misfortune to be the first in the sad calamity which fell upon the Jewish nation through the Assyrian invasion; and, in order to console them under this grievious affliction, Isaiah assures them that, by way of recompense, they, above the rest of their brethren, should have the chief share in the presence and ministry of the future promised Messiah. It seems probable that our Lord remained some time in Judaea after his baptism. From thence he went, with Andrew and Peter, two of John's disciples, into Galilee, where he called Philip. And then it was that he turned the water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana. This was his first coming out of Judaea into Galilee, related by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>, etc.). But the Passover brought him back into Judaea, that he might present himself in the temple; and then occurred his first purging of the temple (<a href="../../par/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14</a>). Then came the visit of Nicedemus to him by night; and then he began openly to preach and to baptize (<a href="../../par/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>), and thus incurred the envy of the scribes and Pharisees. Therefore he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee; and this is the departure here recorded by St. Mark and by St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>). Hence it came to pass that it was in Galilee that Christ called to himself four fishermen - Andrew and Peter, James and John. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The time is fulfilled</span>; that is, the time for the coming of Messiah and of his kingdom. The kingdom which had been shut for so many ages was now to be reopened by the preaching and the death of Christ. The time is very accurately indicated. St. Matthew tells us (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>) that "when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;" and then presently afterwards he adds, "From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand." The time and place are also accurately specified by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36, 37</a>), where he tells Cornelius that "the word of peace, preached by Jesus Christ, was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached." It was necessary that these circumstances should be carefully detailed, because they were among the proofs of the Messiahship of Jesus. Elias must come first; and he had come in the person of the Baptist, although the prophecy probably awaits its full accomplishment in the actual reappearance of the great prophet of Israel before the second coming of our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Repent ye, and believe the gospel</span>. These words may be regarded as a summary of the method of salvation. Repentance and faith are the conditions of admission into the Christian covenant. Repentance has a special reference to God the Father, and faith, to Jesus Christ the eternal Son. It is in the gospel that Christ is revealed to us as a Saviour; and therefore we find Jesus Christ, as the object of our faith, distinguished from the Father as the object of our repentance. Repentance of itself is not sufficient - it makes no satisfaction for the Law which we have broken; and hence, over and above repentance, there is required from us faith in the Gospel, wherein Christ is revealed to us as a propitiation for sin, and as the only way of reconciliation with the Father. Without faith repentance becomes despair, and without repentance faith becomes only presumption. Join the two together, and the faithful soul is borne onwards, like a well-balanced vessel, to the haven where it would be. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now as he walked by the sea</span>  <span class="cmt_word">of Galilee</span>; a better reading is (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="accented">and passing along.</span> Our Lord came up from the south, passing through Samaria, till he reached Cana of Galilee. He then passed along by the seashore towards Capernaum; and on his way found the four disciples whom he had previously nominated, but who were now engaged in their calling of fishermen. St. Mark then relates the circumstances of their call in the exact words of St. Matthew, which were in all probability those of apostolical tradition ('Speaker's Commentary'). It will be seen that St. Mark's account, in this introductory portion of his Gospel, is very concise, and that there are many things to be supplied from the first chapter of St. John; as, for example, that after our Lord's baptism by John, and afar his fasting and temptation in the desert, the Jews sent messengers to the Baptist, to inquire of him whether he were the Christ. John at once confessed that he was not the Christ, but that there was One even then among them, though they knew him not, who was indeed the Christ And then, the very next day after, Jesus came to him, and John then said to those around him, "Behold the Lamb of God!" Upon this two of John's disciples at once betook-themselves to Jesus. The first was Andrew, who forthwith brought his own brother Simon, afterwards called "Peter," to our Lord. Again, the day after the, our Lord called Philip, a fellow-citizen with Andrew and Peter, of Bethsaida. Then Philip brought Nathanael. Here, then, we have some more disciples nominated, who were with Jesus at the marriage in Cana of Galilee. Then Jesus retched again into Judaea; and those disciples "nominate," as we might call them, went back for a time to their occupation of fishermen. Meanwhile our Lord, while in Judaea, wrought miracles and preached, until the envy of the scribes and Pharisees constrained him to return again into Galilee. And then it was that he solemnly called Andrew and Peter, and James and John, as recorded by St. Mark here. So that St John alone gives some account of the events of the first year of our Lord's ministry. The three synoptic Gospels give the narrative of his public ministry, commencing from the second year. <span class="cmt_word">He saw Simon and Andrew, the</span> <span class="cmt_word">brother of Simon casting a net in the sea.</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>). Such was the text underlying the Authorized Version; but a better reading is (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>). St. Mark thinks it unnecessary to mention the net at all; though doubtless it was the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or casting-net. When our Lord likens <span class="cmt_word">his gospel to a net, he uses the</span> figure of the drag-not (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), a net of a much larger size. But whether it be the casting-net or the drag-net, the comparison is a striking one. It is plain that, in the pursuit of his calling, the fisherman has no power to make any separation between the good fish and the worthless. He has little or no insight into what is going on beneath the surface of the water. So with the "fisher of men." He deals with the world spiritual and invisible; and how, then, can he be fully conscious of the results of his work? His work is pre-eminently a work of faith. It may be observed here that St. Mark, in this earlier part of his narrative, speaks of St. Peter as Simon, though afterwards (<a href="../../par/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16</a>) he calls him Peter. We may also notice here, once for all, St. Mark's constant use of the word "straightway" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>). This word occurs no less than ten times in this chapter. In the Authorized Version the word (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)is rendered indifferently by various English synonyms, as "forthwith," "immediately," etc.; whereas in the Revised Version it has been thought fit to note this peculiarity or mannerism in St. Mark's Gospel by the use of the same English synonym, "straightway," throughout this Gospel. The Holy Spirit, while guiding the minds of those whom he moved to write these records, did not use an overpowering influence, so as to interfere with their own natural modes of expression. Each sacred writer, while guarded against error, has reserved to him his own peculiarities of style and expression.

This mention of the "hired servants" is peculiar to St. Mark. He often follows the narrative of St. Matthew; but he adds little details such as this, here and there, which show that he knew St. Matthew's narrative to be true, and also that he was an independent witness. This circumstance here incidentally mentioned shows that there was a difference in position in life between Zebedee's family and that of Simon and Andrew. It appears that all Jews had free right of fishing in the sea of Galilee, which abounded in fish. Zebedee, therefore, whose home seems to have been at Jerusalem, had a fishing establishment in Galilee, probably managed by his partners, Andrew and Simon, during his absence. But he would naturally visit the establishment from time to time With his sons, and especially before the great festivals, when a larger supply of fish than usual would be required for the visitors crowding to Jerusalem at that time. (See 'Speaker's Commentary.')

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they went into</span>  <span class="cmt_word">Capernaum</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they go</span> <span class="accented">into</span> Capernaum (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). St. Mark is fond of the historical "present "tense, which often adds life and energy to his narrative. Who go into Capernaum? Our Lord and these four disciples, the elementary Church of God, the nucleus of that spiritual influence which is to spread wider and wider unto the perfect day. It does not follow that this going into Capernaum took place on the same day. They would not have been fishing on the sabbath day. The synagogue here spoken of was the gift of the good centurion of whom we read in St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a>) and St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/7-2.htm">Luke 7:2</a>). Thus the first synagogue in which our Lord preached was the gift of a generous Gentile officer. It was an emblem of the union of Jews and Gentiles in one fold. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a></div><div class="verse">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were astonished at his teaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span>). The verb in the Greek is a very strong and expressive one; it is a very suitable word to express the first impressions of utter amaze-sent produced by our Lord's "teaching." There were several things which caused his teaching (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span>) to differ from that of the scribes. There was no lack of self-assertion in their teaching; but their words did not carry weight. Their teaching was based chiefly on tradition; it dwelt much on the "mint and anise and cummin" of religion, but neglected "judgment and mercy and faith." Christ's teaching, on the contrary, was eminently spiritual. And then he practiced what he taught. Not so the scribes. Thus far St. Mark's narrative bears the character of brevity and conciseness, suitable to an introduction. From this point his record is rich in detail and in graphic description. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-23.htm">Mark 1:23</a></div><div class="verse">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And straightway there was in their synagogne a man with an unclean spirit</span>. According to the best authorities, the sentence in the Greek runs thus, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x387;</span> <span class="accented">And</span> straightway <span class="accented">there</span> was in their <span class="accented">synagogue</span>, etc. This word "straightway" adds much force to the sentence. It marks the immediate effect of our Lord's preaching. <span class="accented">A man with an unclean spirit.</span> The words are literally, "a man in an unclean spirit" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>); in his grasp, so to speak; possessed by him. There can be no reasonable doubt as to the personality of this unclean spirit (see <a href="../../par/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41</a>). The man was so absolutely in the power of this evil spirit that he seemed to dwell in him; just as the world is said by St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>) to lie "in the evil one" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And he cried out</span>. Who cried out? Surely the unclean spirit, using the possessed man as his instrument. In the case of a true prophet, inspired by the Holy Spirit, he is permitted to use his own gifts, his reason, and even his own particular manner of speech; whereas here a false and lying spirit usurps the organs of speech, and makes them his own. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, Let <i>us</i> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b1;</span>, incorrectly rendered Let us alone, has not sufficient authority to be retained here, though it is rightly retained in the parallel passage in St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/4-34.htm">Luke 4:34</a>), where it is rendered in the Revised Version "Ah!" or "Ha!" If rendered, "Let us alone," or "Let alone," it must be assumed to be the imperative of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>. It will be observed that this cry of the unclean spirit is spontaneous, before our Lord has addressed him. In real truth, the preaching of Jesus has already thrown the whole world of evil spirits into a state of excitement and alarm. The powers of darkness are beginning to tremble. They resent this intrusion into their domain. They feel that One greater than Satan has appeared, and they ask, <span class="cmt_word">What have we to do with thee?</span> Wherein have we injured thee, that thou shouldest seek to drive us out of our possession? We have nothing to do with thee, thou Holy One of God; but we have a right to take possession of sinners. Beds says that the evil spirits, perceiving that "our Lord had come into the world, believed that they were about at once to be judged. They knew that dispossession would be their entrance upon a condition of torment, and therefore it is that they deprecate it." I know <span class="cmt_word">thee who thou art, the Holy One of God</span>. St. Mark is very careful to bring out the hidden knowledge possessed by evil spirits, which enabled them at once to recognize the personality of Jesus (see <a href="../../par/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11</a>). It was given to them by him who has supreme power over the spiritual as well as the material world, to know as much as he saw fit that they should know; and he was pleased to make known as much as was needful. "But he made himself known to them, not as he makes himself known to the holy angels, who know him as the Word of God, and rejoice in his eternity, of which they partake. To the evil spirits he made himself known only so far as was requisite to strike with terror the beings from whose tyranny he was about to free those who were predestinated unto his kingdom and the glory of it" (see St. Augustine, 'City of God,' bk. 9:&sect; 21). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-25.htm">Mark 1:25</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hold thy peace, and come out of him</span>. It was necessary that our Lord should at once assert his absolute power over the evil spirits; and not only this, but also that he should show that he had nothing to do with them. Later on in his ministry it was objected to him that he cast out devils by the prince of the devils. Then,  further, the time was not yet arrived when Christ was to be publicly proclaimed as the Son of God. This great truth was to be gradually unfolded, and the people were to be persuaded by many miracles. But at present they were not prepared for this, and therefore our Lord charged his apostles that they should not make him known. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-26.htm">Mark 1:26</a></div><div class="verse">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the unclean spirit had torn him; and cried with</span> <span class="cmt_word">a loud voice, he came out of him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>). The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> may be rendered in the passive to <span class="accented">be convulsed.</span> It is so used by medical writers, as Galen. It could hardly here mean physically "laceration," for St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/4-35.htm">Luke 4:35</a>) is careful to say that "when the devil had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt." At all events, the expression indicates the close union of the evil spirit with the possessed man's consciousness and with his physical frame. And the manner in which he departed showed his malignity, as though, being compelled by the supreme authority of Christ to leave the man, he would injure him as far as he was able to do so. But the power of Christ prevented him from doing any real injury. And all this was done <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that there might be clear evidence that the man was actually possessed by the evil spirit; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the anger and malice of the evil spirit might be shown; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it might be manifest that the unclean spirit came out, not of his own accord, but constrained and vanquished by Christ. We may observe also that the power of Christ restrained him from the use of any articulate words. While he was in possession he used the possessed man's organs of speech; but when he came out there was no articulate speech - it was nothing but a cry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a></div><div class="verse">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <i>is</i> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What thing is this? what new doctrine is this?</span> The now generally approved text gives a different rendering, namely, <span class="accented">What is this</span>? <span class="accented">a new teaching</span>!

If this is the true reading - and there is excellent authority for it - it would mean that the bystanders inferred that this new and unexampled power indicated the accompanying gift of a "new teaching," a new revelation. Nay, more, it indicated that he who wrought these miracles must be the promised Messiah, the true God; for he alone by his power could rule the evil spirits.

There were marshes in that district; hence the prevalence of fevers of a malignant character. There is no mention of the wife of Peter by name in the New Testament. We may infer, from the fact that his wish's mother lived with him, that he was the head of the family. St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>) intimates that he was a married man, and that his wife accompanied him on his missionary tours. According to the testimony of Clement of Alexandria, and of Eusebius (3:30), she suffered martyrdom, and was led away to death in the sight of her husband, whose last words to her were, "Remember thou the Lord." St. Mark here tells us that Jesus came and took [Simon's wife's mother] by the hand, and raised her up. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/4-39.htm">Luke 4:39</a>) says that "he stood over her and rebuked the fever." <span class="cmt_word">Immediately the fever left her</span>. The word "immediately" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), familiar as it is to St. Mark, is here omitted by the best authorities. But the omission is of no importance; for the fact that "the fever left her," and that she was at once strong enough to "minister to them," proves that it was not like an ordinary recovery from fever, which is wont to be slow and tedious.

Our Lord thus prepared himself by prayer for his first departure on a  missionary tour. This would be the morning of the first day of the week. A great while before day he left the scene of excitement. That was not a time for preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom. The miracles attracted attention to him, but they were not the object for which he came. They were necessary as means of stirring and awakening men's minds, and of fixing their attention upon him and upon the great salvation which he came to reveal. So he left the miracles to do their subordinate work; and he himself went into a desert place, that he might pray with more quiet and less distraction. He retired that he might escape the applause of men, which they were ready to lavish upon him after seeing so many miracles; that he might thus teach us to shun the praise of men. Let us learn from Christ to give the early morning to prayer, and to rise with the dawn of day, that we may have time for meditation, and give the firstfruits of the morning to God. The early morning is favorable for study; but it is specially dear to God and his angels.

From St. Matthew we learn that it took place after the sermon on the mount; and yet not at the very close of his missionary circuit, St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>) says that the diseased man was "full of leprosy" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The disorder was fully developed; it had spread over his whole body; he was leprous from head to foot. This leprosy was designed to be specially typical of the disease of sin. It was not infectious. It was not because it was either infectious or contagious that the leper was bidden under the Jewish Law to wars others off, in the words," Unclean! un-clean!" It was in some cases hereditary. It was a very revolting disease. It was a poisoning of the springs of life. It was a living death. It was incurable by any human art or skill. It was the awful sign of sin reaching unto death; and it was cured, as sin is cured, only by the mercy and favor of God. No wonder, then, that our Lord specially displayed his power over this terrible disease, that he might thus prove his power over the still worse malady of sin. St. Mark here tells us that this leper knelt down (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). St. Matthew says (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>) that he "worshipped <span class="accented">him</span>," (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); St. Luke says (<a href="../../par/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>) that "he fell on his face" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). We thus see that the scriptural idea of worship is associated with some lowly posture of the body. But with this worship of the body, the leper offered also the homage of the soul. His prostration of himself before Christ was not merely a rendering of honor to an earthly being; it was a rendering of reverence to a Divine Being. For he does not say to him, "If thou wilt ask of God, he will give it thee;" but he says, "If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." It is as though he said, "I know that thou art of equal power with the Father, and therefore supreme Lord over diseases; so that by thy word alone thou canst remove this leprosy from me. I ask, therefore, that thou wouldst be willing to do this, and then I know that the thing is done." The leper had faith in the Divine power of Christ, partly out of his own inward illumination, and partly by the evidence of the miracles which Christ had already wrought. If thou wilt, thou east. Observe the hypothetic expression, "If thou wilt." He has no doubt as to Christ's power, but the words, "If thou <span class="accented">wilt"</span> show that his desire for healing was controlled by resignation to the will of God. For bodily diseases are often necessary for the health of the soul; and this God knows, though man knows it not. Therefore, in asking for earthly blessings, it behoves us to resign ourselves to the will and wisdom of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - Observe in this verse that Jesus stretched forth his hand and touched the leper. Thus he showed that he was superior to the Law, which forbade contact with a leper. He touched him, knowing that he could not be defiled with the touch. He touched him that he might heal him, and that his Divine power of healing might be made manifest. "Thus," says Bode, "God stretched out his hand and touched the human nature in his incarnation, and restored to the Church those who had been cast out, that they might be able to offer their bodies a living sacrifice to him of whom it is said, 'Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Molchisedec.'" I will; be  thou clean; literally, <span class="accented">be thou made clean</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). It is well observed here by St. Jerome that our Lord aptly answers both the petitions of the leper. "If thou wilt;" "I will." "Thou canst make me clean;" "Be thou made clean." Indeed, Christ gives him more than he asks for. He makes him whole, not only in body, but in spirit. Thus Christ, in his loving-kindness, exceeds the wishes of his supplicants, that we may learn from him to do the same, and to enlarge our hearts, both towards God and towards our brethren. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-42.htm">Mark 1:42</a></div><div class="verse">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Straightway</span> - St. Mark's favourite word - <span class="cmt_word">the leprosy departed from him</span>. There is no interval between the command and the work of Christ. "He spake, and it was done." His will is his omnipotence. By this act Christ showed that he came into the world as a great Physician, that he might cure all diseases, and cleanse us from all our defilements. The word "straightway" shows that Christ healed the leper, not by any natural means, but by a Divine power which works instantly. He is alike powerful both to commend and to do. St. Matthew says here (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>) that straightway "his leprosy was cleansed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). There is here what is called a "hypallage," or inversion of the meaning, which is, of course, that "he was cleansed from his leprosy." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-43.htm">Mark 1:43</a></div><div class="verse">And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he straitly charged him</span>. The Greek verb here (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) has a tinge of severity in it, "he strictly [or <span class="accented">sternly</span>] charged him." Both word and action are severe. <span class="cmt_word">He straightway sent him</span> <span class="cmt_word">out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>). It may be that he had incurred this rebuke by coming so near with his defilement to the holy Saviour. Christ thus showed not only his respect for the ordinances of the Jewish Law, but also how hateful sin is to the most holy God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a></div><div class="verse">And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">See thou say nothing to any man</span>. St. Chrysostom says that our Lord gave him this charge, "to shun ostentation, and to teach us not to boast of our virtues, but to hide them." It is evident that he wished to draw the thoughts of men away from his miracles, and to fix them upon his doctrine. <span class="cmt_word">Go thy way, show thyself to the priest</span>; <span class="accented">the</span> priest who in the order of his course presided over the rest. Our Lord sent him to the priest, that he might be seen to recognize their special office in cases of leprosy; and further, that the priest himself might have clear evidence that this leper was cleansed, not after the custom of the Law, but by the operation of grace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/1-45.htm">Mark 1:45</a></div><div class="verse">But he went out, and began to publish <i>it</i> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter</span>. It seems difficult to blame the man for doing what he thought must tend to the honor of his Healer; though, no doubt, it would have been better if he had humbly obeyed. And yet it was to be expected that the knowledge of our Lord's mighty works would be published by others. In this particular instance the effect of this man's conduct was probably unexpected by himself; for it led to the withdrawal of Christ from Capernaum. The crowds who were attracted to him by the fame of his miracles would have hampered him, so that he could not have exercised his ministry; for even in the desert places they sought him out, and came to him from every quarter. It should be noticed here that this first chapter of St. Mark embraces, in very condensed form, about twelve months of our Lord's public ministry, from his baptism by John. And it is a record of uninterrupted progress. The time had not then come for the opposition of the scribes and Pharisees and Herodians to show itself. It was, no doubt, wisely ordained that his gospel should take root and lay hold of the hearts and consciences of men, as it must have done in the minds of the Galilaeans more especially, before it had to encounter the envy and malice of those who ultimately would bring him to his cross. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/28.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 28"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 28" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../mark/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Mark 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Mark 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
