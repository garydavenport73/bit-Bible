To write the same things to you, to me indeed <i>is</i> not grievous, but for you <i>it is</i> safe.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord</span>. This word "finally" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is frequently used by St. Paul to introduce a practical conclusion after the doctrinal portion of his Epistles: thus it occurs again in <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, and also in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>. Some render <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "farewell;" but "rejoice" seems more suitable here. The golden thread of spiritual joy runs through this Epistle. "Rejoice in the Lord" is the oft-repeated refrain of St. Paul's solemn hymn of praise. <span class="cmt_word">To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe</span>. "The same things:" does he refer to his oral instructions, to a previous Epistle now lost, to his exhortations to unity, or to his reiterated command "Rejoice"? The words seem most naturally to point to something in the same Epistle rather than to advice given on former occasions. It is true that Polycarp, in his letter to the Philippiaus (section 3), says that St. Paul wrote Epistles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>) to them; but there is no trace of any other Epistle; and the mere plural number is not sufficient to support the theory of other letters, the plural word being frequently used of a single letter. Bishop Lightfoot suggests the exhortation to unity in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>. But this topic does not reappear before <a href="../../par/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>. And the hypothesis of an interruption, which (as Bishop Lightfoot and others think) suddenly turned the apostle's thoughts into another channel and prevented him from explaining <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> (the same things) till <a href="../../par/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>, seems forced and unnecessary, notwithstanding the great authority by which it is supported. It seems more probable (Bengel and others) that St. Paul refers to the constant admonition of this Epistle, "Rejoice in the Lord." To repeat this again and again was to him not grievous (rather, with R.V., "irksome"), but safe for the Philippians. Christian joy has a close connection with safety, for it implies unswerving faith, and, more than that, the presence of Christ. Compare the oft-repeated exhortation of <a href="../../par/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, "Fret not thyself: it tends only to evil-doing" (ver. 8, in the Hebrew). Possibly, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span> here, as in <a href="../../par/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a> and. 25:26, may mean "certain." The repetition is not irksome to St. Paul, while it makes his meaning and his wishes certain to the Philippians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision</span>. The connection is, as given in ver. 3, Rejoice in the Lord, not in the flesh; have confidence in him, not in the ceremonies of the Jewish Law. Compare the same contrast in <a href="../../par/galatians/6-13.htm">Galatians 6:13, 14</a>. There is certainly something abrupt in the sudden introduction of this polemic against Judaizing, especially in writing to Philippi, where there were not many Jews. But there may have been circumstances, unknown to us, which made the warning necessary; or, as some think, the apostle may have written this under excitement caused by the violent opposition of the Jewish faction at Rome. <span class="accented">Beware</span>; literally, <span class="accented">mark</span>, observe them, to be on your guard against them. The <span class="accented">dogs.</span> The article must be retained in the translation. The Jews called the Gentiles "dogs" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unclean, mainly because of their disregard of the distinction between clean and unclean food. St. Paul retorts the epithet: they are the dogs, who have confidence in the flesh, not in spiritual religion. <span class="accented">Evil workers</span>; so <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>, where he calls them "deceitful workers." The Judaizers were active enough, like the Pharisees who "compassed sea and land to make one proselyte;" but their activity sprang from bad motives - they were evil workers, though their work was sometimes overruled for good (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15-18</a>). <span class="accented">The concision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, cutting, mutilation); a contemptuous word for "circumcision" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>). Compare the Jewish contemptuous use of Isbosheth, man of shame, for Eshbaal, man of Baal, etc. Their circumcision is no better than a mutilation. Observe the paronomasia, the combination of like-sounding words, which is common in St. Paul's Epistles. Winer gives many examples in sect. lxviii.

Of the stock of Israel Neither were his parents proselytes; he was by descent an Israelite. He uses here the highest title of God's ancient people, the title which implied the inheritance of the covenant made with Jacob. Other nations were descended from Abraham and Isaac; the Israelites alone could claim Jacob for their ancestor; they only could glory in the covenant name given to him when he wrestled all night long with the angel, and proved himself a prince with God (comp.

His father and mother were not only Israelites, but also they retained, though living at Tarsus, the Hebrew language and customs. St. Paul was not a Hellenist; he was brought up at Jerusalem under the great Rabban Gamaliel; he spoke Hebrew (<a href="../../par/acts/21-40.htm">Acts 21:40</a>), and uses the Hebrew Scriptures as well as the Septuagint translation.

As far as "the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees" went, the righteousness which is "in Law," which consists, that is, in the observance of formal rules; or which is "of Law" (ver. 9), which springs, that is, from such observance, St. Paul was found blameless. "Rara sane laus et prope singularis," says Calvin, quoted by Alford; "videamus tureen quanti eam fecerit." (For the whole of this passage, comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-21.htm">2 Corinthians 11:21, 22</a>.)

He holds fast the truth which he once learned; he still counts all things as loss in comparison with the one thing needful.

There the Jews were the children, the Gentiles dogs. St. Paul here, as in ver. 2, reverses the terms of the comparison; the legal privileges of the Jew nee but as crumbs thrown to dogs in comparison with the rich blessings of the gospel. Comp. also <a href="../../par/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, where our Lord uses the same verbs, to lose and to gain; the whole world is but loss, the Savior says, compared with the never-dying soul. The loss of one's all in this world (St. Paul echoes the sacred words) is as nothing; all things put together are but as dung, compared with the one thing which St. Paul so longed to gain, Christ himself - his presence in the soul, spiritual union with the Lord. "To gain Christ is to lay fast hold upon him, to receive him inwardly into our bosoms, and so to make him ours and ourselves his, that we may be joined to him as our Head, espoused to him as our Husband, incorporated into him as our Nourishment, engrafted in him as our Stock, and laid upon him as a sure Foundation" (Bishop Hall, ' Christ Mystical,' ch. 6, quoted by Bishop EIlicott). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a></div><div class="verse">And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be found in him; now, at the last day, always</span>. <span class="accented">In Christ</span>; a member, that is, of his body, a living branch of the true Vine. <span class="cmt_word">Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the Law</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">not harding a righteousness of mine</span> own, <span class="accented">even that which is of the Law.

But perhaps the words are best rendered, as in the margin of R.V., "Not having as my righteousness that which is of the Law." St. Paul was blameless as regards that righteousness which lies in legal observances: in that he puts no confidence, he seeks a better righteousness<span class="cmt_word">. But that which is through the faith of Christ;</span> rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">through faith in</span> Christ. There is no article, and the genitive is objective. Through faith. God is the Giver, the Source of righteousness; it is given through faith as the means, on condition of faith. <span class="cmt_word">The righteousness which is of God by faith</span>. Greek, "upon faith," based upon faith, or on condition of faith. St. Paul speaks of "having" this righteousness. Then it is his; yet it is not any righteousness of his own, "Not by works of righteousness which we have done;" but a righteousness of God given to him, merited, not by his works, but by the perfect obedience and the precious death of Christ, and granted unto all who are found in Christ. It comes from God, the one only Giver of all good things; it is obtained through faith as the instrument or means; and it is given on that faith - on condition, that is, of a living faith abiding in the soul. Thus St. Paul states incidentally, but simply and forcibly, the great doctrine of justification by faith.

For the grammatical construction, see Winer, sect. 44:b. For the sense, comp. <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where Dr. Westcott notes, "In such a connection, <span class="accented">Knowledge</span> expresses the apprehension of the truth by the whole nature of man.

We must be found in Christ in order to know him; we must have that righteousness which is through the faith of Christ, for we can know him only by being made like unto him. Comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>, "When he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is;" and now those who see him by faith are in their measure being transformed into the same image. For the knowledge here spoken of is a personal knowledge, gained, not by hearing or reading, but by direct personal communion with the Lord; it is not theoretical, but experimental. "non expertus fuerit, non intelligit" (Anselm, quoted by Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">And the power of his resurrection</span>. The resurrection of Christ was a glorious manifestation of Divine power (<a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>). That resurrection is now a power in the spiritual life of Christians: it stimulates the spiritual resurrection, the resurrection from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). It is the center of our most cherished hopes, the evidence of our immortality, the earnest of the resurrection of the body. <span class="cmt_word">And the fellowship of his sufferings</span>. This clause and the last are bound together under one article, according to the best manuscripts. There is a very close connection between them (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>). To know the quickening power of his resurrection, we must share his sufferings. The Christian, meditating in loving thought on the sufferings of Christ, is led to feel ever a deeper, a more awful sympathy with the suffering Savior. And if, when we are called to suffer, we take it patiently, looking unto Jesus, then our sufferings are united with his sufferings,  "we suffer <span class="accented">with</span> him." And he who hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows feels for us in his sacred heart, being "touched with the feeling of our infirmities." This fellowship in suffering leads through his grace to fellowship in glory (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Being made conformable unto his death</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">becoming conformed.</span> The participle is present: it implies a continual progress. It is derived from the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, form, used in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> (where see note), and denotes, not a mere external resemblance, but a deep, real, inner conformity. The reference is not to the impending death of martyrdom, but to that daffy dying unto self and the world which the apostle exhibited in the heroic self-denials of his holy life: he was "crucified with Christ" (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>).

For the particles, "if by any means" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), comp. <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-14.htm">Romans 11:14</a>. The verb "attain" means to arrive at the end of a journey; it presents the figure of a pilgrimage. Read, with R.V. and the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">the resurrection from the dead.</span> This phrase (used also in <a href="../../par/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>) means the resurrection of the <span class="accented">blessed</span> dead (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). This meaning is strengthened here by the repetition of the preposition with the word "resurrection" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The general resurrection is always called the resurrection <span class="accented">of</span> the dead. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not as though I had already. attained, either were already perfect</span>; the R.V. renders this clause more accurately, <span class="accented">not that</span> (1<span class="accented">. do not say that</span>) <span class="accented">I have already obtained.</span> The verb is not the same with that translated "attain" in ver. 11; it means to get, to win a prize, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. The tense is aorist: "I say not that I did at once win the prize;" that is, at the time of his conversion. Compare the tenses used in ver. 8, "I suffered the loss of all things;" and ver. 12, "I was apprehended;" which both refer to the same time. The prize was gained in a moment; it needs the continued effort of a lifetime. St. Paul proceeds, using now the perfect tense, "Nor have I been already made perfect." He has not even now reached perfection; he is still working out his own salvation. There may be here a delicate allusion to the spiritual pride which seems to have disturbed the unity of the Philippians (see <a href="../../par/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But I follow after</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">pursue</span>, <span class="accented">I press</span> on. <span class="cmt_word">If that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus</span>. The words rendered "for which" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>) will admit three different interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of A.V., which implies the ellipse of the antecedent "that;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that given in the margin of R.V., "seeing that;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that of the R.V., "for which," for which purpose (that is, that I may press on and persevere) I was also apprehended by Christ Jesus. All these translations are possible, and all give a good sense. Perhaps <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> best suits the context, "I press on to lay hold o[the prize, because Christ first laid hold of me." The grace of the Lord Jesus furnishes the highest motive; it is the Christian's bounden duty to press on always in the Christian race, <span class="accented">because</span> Christ first called him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13</a></div><div class="verse">Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but <i>this</i> one thing <i>I do</i>, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">I reckon.</span> Two of the best manuscripts read "not yet" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>). The pronouns are emphatic: whatever others may think of me or of themselves, "I reckon not <span class="accented">myself to</span> have apprehended." <span class="cmt_word">But this one thing</span>. The ellipse here is forcible; some supply "I reckon;" others, "I say;" others, as A.V., "I do," which seems best suited to the context. <span class="cmt_word">I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before</span>. St. Paul concentrates all his thoughts and all his energies on the one great end of life, the one thing needful. He forgets those things which are behind; that is, not, as some explain, his Jewish privileges and distinctions, but that part of his Christian race already past. So Chrysostom, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>; <span class="accented">Reaching forth.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>; is singularly emphatic: it means that the athlete throws himself forward in the race with all his energies strained to the very utmost. Compare Bengel, "Oculus manum, manus pedem praevertit et trahit." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus</span>; rather, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">unto the prize.</span> The first preposition, "towards," expresses the aim; the second, "unto," the end of the race. <span class="accented">The high calling</span>; the upward, heavenward calling. God is calling us all upward, heavenward, by the voice of the Lord Jesus, who is the Word of God. Comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>, "Partakers of the heavenly calling." The words, "in Christ Jesus," are to be taken with "the high calling." It is God who calls: he calls us in the person of Christ, by the voice of Christ, "Come unto me." "It was his will that thou shouldst run the race below; he gives the crown above. Seest thou not that even here they crown the most honored of the athletes, not on the racecourse below,  but the king calls them up, and crowns them there" (Chrysostom). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded</span>. "Perfect" here means mature, full grown, as opposed to babes or children. The word is so used (in the Greek) in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>. "There is a difference," says Bengel, on ver. 12, "between the perfect and the perfected: the first are ready for the. race; the last are close upon the prize." St. Paul exhorts all full-grown Christians to imitate his perseverance; like him, to forsake any claims to legal righteousness; to seek that righteousness which is through the faith of Christ; to know Christ, to win Christ; to press ever forwards to obtain the prize. <span class="cmt_word">And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you</span>.. If only we be in earnest, pressing onwards in the Christian race with sustained perseverance, God will, by the manifestation of his Spirit in our heart, correct any minor errors of doctrine or of practice. Comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>, "If any man willeth to do (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God." "Otherwise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) seems here to mean otherwise thin is right, wrongly, amiss - a meaning which it has not unfrequently in classical Greek, and in our word "heterodox." Even <span class="accented">this</span>; rather, <span class="accented">this too</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> well as the one thing needful, the knowledge of Christ, which he has already revealed. Mark the word "reveal." Paul may teach, but living spiritual knowledge is a revelation from God. This passage shows that the word "perfect" is used here in a restricted sense, not of consummated holiness; as it implies that some of the "perfect" may be "otherwise minded," may be involved in minor errors. Good Christians must have that righteousness which is through faith; they must persevere: they may err in less essential points. It is a lesson of charity and humility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-16.htm">Philippians 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing</span>. Omit, with the best manuscripts, the words from "rule" to "thing," and translate, <span class="accented">R.V.</span>, <span class="accented">only</span>, <span class="accented">whereunto we have already attained</span>, <span class="accented">by that same</span> (<span class="accented">rule</span>) <span class="accented">let us walk</span>; or, more literally, <span class="accented">only</span>, <span class="accented">what we arrived at</span>, <span class="accented">by that same walk. Let</span> there be no falling back; let us, at each point in our Christian course, maintain and walk according to that degree of grace at which we arrived. This explanation seems more probable than the other view, which understands the words, "by the same," of the rule of faith as opposed to the works of the Law. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">imitators together.</span> They are to unite, one and all, in imitating him. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a> he gives the ground of this advice, "As I also am of Christ." <span class="accented">Mark</span>, here in order to imitate; elsewhere (as <a href="../../par/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>) in order to avoid. He changes the singular number to the plural, modestly shrinking from proposing himself alone as their example. But "ensample" is still singular, because they all (Timothy, Epaphroditus, etc.) present the same image, all imitating Christ. Observe the change of metaphor: hitherto the Christian life has been compared to a race; now he speaks of walking; literally, <span class="accented">walking about</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>), moving hither and thither in the daily path of life.

He used to speak thus of them when he was at Philippi; now, during his absence, the evil has increased, and he repeats his warning with tears. "Paul weeps," says Chrysostom, "for those at whom others laugh; so true is his sympathy, so deep his care for all men." He seems to be speaking here, not of the Jews, but of nominal Christians, who used their liberty for a cloke of licentiousness. Such are enemies of the cross; they hate sell-denial, they will not take up their cross. By their evil lives they bring shame upon the religion of the cross.

The word "our" is emphatic; the apostle refers back to ver. 17: "Follow us, not those enemies of the cross; <span class="accented">our</span> conversation is in heaven; <span class="accented">they</span> mind earthly things." The A.V. has this same word "conversation" in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, where the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) is the verb corresponding with the noun (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x39c;&#x3b1;</span>) which occurs here. The verb is used in the sense of a certain mode of life or conversation, as in <a href="../../par/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>, but it does not appear that the noun ever bears that meaning. The rendering" citizenship" also seems deficient in authority. In classical Greek the word has three meanings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a form of government; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> political acts, politics; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a commonwealth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last seems the most suitable here.

He had already told us (ver. 10) that the Christian soul is being gradually conformed during life unto the death of Christ. He now tells us that this conformity of the Christian unto Christ is ultimately to extend to the body. The Lord shall change the outward fashion of our body; but this change will be more than a change of outward fashion: it will result in a real conformity of the resurrection-body of the believer unto the glorious body of the Lord. <span class="accented">The body of our humiliation</span>; not "vile body."
