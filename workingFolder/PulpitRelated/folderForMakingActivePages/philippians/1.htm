St. Paul does not assume his official title in writing to the Macedonian Churches, Philippi and Thessalonica; it is used in all his other Epistles, except the short letter to Philemon. His relations to the Philippians and Thessalonians were those of the deepest personal affection; there was no need of a formal introduction, especially in an Epistle which has so little of an official character as this to the Philippians. He joins the name of Timothy with his own, as in 2 Corinthians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Thus Timothy is associated with St. Paul in every Epistle in which another name is found except 1 Corinthians, where Sosthenes only is mentioned; this shows the intimate affection that bound St. Paul to his "own son in the faith." There was a special reason for mentioning Timothy in this Epistle, as he was so well known to the Philippians, and St. Paul was intending (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>) to send him shortly to Philippi. But St. Paul writes in his own name from the beginning. Timothy was not in any sense a joint author; he may possibly have been St. Paul's amanuensis, as Tertius was in the case of the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="../../par/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a>). Possibly also motives of humility led St. Paul to insert other names besides his own; but it was not to support his teaching by additional authority - he was "an apostle, not of man, neither by man," and needed not the weight of other names. <span class="cmt_word">The servants of Jesus Christ</span>; <span class="accented">slaves</span>, literally: "made free from sin and become servants [slaves] to God," whose service is perfect freedom. We belong to him: he he is our Master (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) as well as Father, we are his slaves as well as his sons: "Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price." Compare the words of the "damsel possessed with a spirit of divination" at Philippi: "These men are the servants [slaves] of the most high God." She felt the difference between her state and theirs; she was the slave of her Philip-plan masters, of the evil spirit too; St. Paul and his companion were the slaves of God most high. In the best manuscripts, as in the R.V., "Christ" is put before "Jesus" here. The apostle frequently sets the official before the personal name of our Lord; possibly because he knew not the Lord Jesus after the flesh, but saw him first as the Messiah, the Christ of God. <span class="cmt_word">To all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi</span>. The word "all" is of very frequent occurrence in this Epistle. There may possibly be a reference to the dissensions alluded to in ch. 4:2; or, as some think, to the supplies sent for St. Paul's assistance; he addresses all alike, not only those who contributed; he does not recognize their divisions. But it is, perhaps, only the natural expression of his warm affection: the apostle was beloved by all the Philippians, and all were dear to him; there was no hostile faction there, as at Corinth and else where. Compare the affectionate repetition, "always," "every," "all," in Ver. 4. St. Paul uses the word "saint" as the general name for his converts, like "Christian." The word "Christian" occurs only three times in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). Christ's people are called "brethren," "disciples," or "saints." Thus St. Paul addresses the Corinthians generally as "saints," though many of them were far from possessing holiness of heart and life. The ancient Church was holy; the Israelites are called "a holy nation," "saints of the Most High." They were holy by God's election, his chosen  people, separated unto him by the rite of circumcision. By the same election the Christian Church is holy, dedicated to God in baptism. This holiness of dedication (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-14.htm">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>) does not necessarily involve the actual existence of that inner holiness of heart "without which no man shall see the Lord." But it does imply the bounden duty of striving after that spiritual holiness. "Ye are the temple of the living God," St. Paul says to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). "for God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people...  <span class="accented">therefore</span>...   let us cleanse ourselves from el! filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in our translation sometimes "holy," sometimes "saint") is the usual rendering for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The primary idea of the Hebrew word seems to be that of separation - separation from all that defileth. God is "of purer eyes than to behold evil;" those who are dedicated to him must strive by his grace to purify themselves even as he is pure. "Be ye holy, for I am holy." <span class="accented">In Christ Jesus.</span> They are saints in virtue of their relation to Christ. They were once" baptized into one body" - the mystical body of Christ. Holiness of dedication can issue in holiness of heart and life only by abiding <span class="accented">in him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>). All saints are one body in Christ; they are knit together into one communion and fellowship by their personal union with the one Lord. <span class="cmt_word">With the bishops and deacons</span>. In the New Testament the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5-7</a>). St. Paul is addressing the elders of the Church at Philippi, not bishops in our sense of the word. It is possible that Epaphroditus may have been the presiding bishop of the Church (see notes on Philippians 2:25 and Philippians 4:3). If so, we see a reason why the second and third orders of the ministry only are mentioned, as Epaphroditus was the bearer of the Epistle. But diocesan episcopacy does not seem to have become general till the last quarter of the first century. We know that Paul and Barnabas "ordained elders in every Church" in their first missionary journey; we need not, therefore, be surprised at the mention of these official designations in this Epistle, which was written seventeen or eighteen years later. St. Paul's address to the elders of the Church at Ephesus shows the importance which he attached to the office and to the faithful performance of its duties. Perhaps "the bishops and deacons" are specially mentioned here as having collected. the contributions sent to St. Paul; so Chrysostom and Meyer. On the whole subject, see Bishop Lightfoot's exhaustive 'Dissertation on the Christian Ministry,' in his volume on the Epistle to the Philippians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-2.htm">Philippians 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace be unto you, and peace</span>. This combination of the Greek and Hebrew salutations is the common form in St. Paul's earlier Epistles; in the pastoral Epistles "mercy" is added. Grace is the favor of God, free and sovereign, which rests on the faithful Christian, and brings the gift of peace; which is, first, reconciliation with God and, secondly, the childlike confidence and trustful hope which result from faith in Christ's atonement. <span class="cmt_word">From God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ</span>. God the Father is the first Author of our salvation; God the Son, the Word made flesh, brought the message of peace from heaven, and reconciled us to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you</span>. All St. Paul's Epistles, except those to the Galatiaus, 1 Timothy, and Titus, begin with a thanksgiving. In this Epistle the thanksgiving is especially warm and earnest; no cloud of doubt darkened the apostle's confidence in the Philippians; he pours forth his gratitude to God for their spiritual gifts fervently and without reserve. <span class="accented">My God.</span> The pronoun expresses the inner consciousness of personal relations with God; it reminds us of <a href="../../par/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>, "God, whose I am, and whom I serve." <span class="accented">Upon all my remembrance of you</span> (as R.V.) is the more exact rendering. The remembrance (not mention)was continuous; he "had them in his heart," and that unbroken remembrance resulted in unbroken thanksgiving. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy</span>. Perhaps the first part of this verse is better joined with Ver. 3, "I <span class="accented">thank my God</span>...  <span class="accented">always in every prayer of mine for you all</span>;" so Bishop Lightfoot The Greek word for "prayer" and "request "is the same, better rendered "my supplication," he as the R.V.; it implies not merely a lifting up of the heart to God, but an earnest entreaty for a <span class="accented">necessary</span> gift. We meet now for the first time with that "joy" which is the keynote of this Epistle. "Summa epistolae, Gaudeo; gaudete;" so Bengel, who continues, "This Epistle of joy well follows that to the Ephesians, where love reigns. 'The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy.' Joy gives life to prayer." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel.</span> This verse should be taken in connection with Ver. 3. St. Paul thanks God for their help, their co-operation towards the work of the gospel. They helped forward the work by their prayers, their labors,  and their liberal bounty. This fellowship began "in the beginning of the gospel," when the Philippians sent aid to the apostle at Thessalonica and Corinth; it continued "until now" ten years; they had just sent their alms to St. Paul at Rome by phroditus (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <i>it</i> until the day of Jesus Christ:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being confident of this very thing</span>. St. Paul's thanksgiving refers, not only to the past, but also to the future. He has a confident trustfulness in God's power and love. The words <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> might mean "on this account," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on account of the perseverance described in Ver. 5, but the order seems to support the ordinary rendering. <span class="cmt_word">That he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it;</span> rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">which began.</span> Both <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> have (Bishop Lightfoot) a sacrificial reference. The good work is self-consecration, the sacrifice of themselves, their souls and bodies, issuing in the co-operation of labor and almsgiving. This sacrificial metaphor recurs in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>. The good work is God's; he began it and he will perfect it. The beginning (Bengel) is the pledge of the consummation. Yet it is also their work - their co-operation towards the gospel (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Until the day of Jesus Christ</span>. The perfecting will go on until the great day. To the individual Christian that clay is practically the day of his death; though, indeed, the process of perfecting may be going on in the holy dead till they obtain their perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul. These words do not imply that St. Paul expected the second advent during the life of his Philippian converts. The words "in you" must be understood as meaning "in your hearts," not merely "among you." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all</span>. It is <span class="accented">meet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">just</span>, <span class="accented">right. To think this</span>; to entertain this confidence concerning you. <span class="cmt_word">Because I have you in my heart</span>; or, <span class="accented">because you have me in your heart.</span> But the order of the words, and ver. 8, make the first rendering the more probable. His love for them increases his confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel</span>. These words may be taken with the preceding, "I have you in my heart during my imprisonment and defense." So Chrysostom, whose words are very striking: <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. But it is, perhaps, more natural to take them with the following. <span class="cmt_word">Ye all are partakers of my grace</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye all are partakers with me of the grace.</span> They were partakers of the grace of God given to him in his bonds and in his work. The like grace was given to them both for the passive and active sides of the Christian life - both in endurance of suffering and in propagating the gospel. Thus there seems to be no reference in the words "defense and confirmation" to his public defense before Caesar (which probably had not yet taken place), but generally to his work of preaching the gospel, which was both apologetic, meeting the objections of adversaries, and aggressive, asserting the truth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is my record</span> - rather, <span class="accented">witness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, here rendered "bowels," means the heart, liver, etc.. he not the entrails. The expression is remarkable, and is well illustrated by Bengel's striking words, "Paulus non in Pauli, sed Jesu Christi movetur visceribus." "Not I, but Christ liveth in me." He is so united with Christ that he feels with the heart of Christ, he loves with the love of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <i>in</i> all judgment;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this I pray</span>. This is the purport of the prayer already mentioned in Ver. 4. The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> marks the end of St. Paul's prayer, and so its purport. <span class="cmt_word">That your love may abound yet more and more</span>. Your love; not love for the apostle only, but the grace of Christian charity. St. Paul finds no fault with the Philippians, but "ignis in apostolo nunquam dicit, Sufficit" (Bengel). He prays for their continued growth in love, but not unintelligent love. <span class="cmt_word">In knowledge and in all judgment</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: it means full, complete knowledge. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (literally, <span class="accented">sense</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament, though <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (organs of sense) is found in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>. "Discernment," the rendering of R.V., is more correct than "judgment." It is, Bishop Wordsworth says, "that delicate tact and instinct, which almost intuitively perceives what is right, and almost unconsciously shrinks from what is wrong." It cannot exist without love. "Every one that loveth is born of God, and <span class="accented">knoweth</span> God." With love there comes a spiritual sense, spiritual sight, spiritual hearing, a sense of the beauty of holiness, a fine perception of Christian propriety; <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>.

Love, issuing in spiritual discernment, would enable them to recognize, to test, to prove things that are excellent; so Bengel," Non modo prae malts bona, seal in bonds optima." This seems better than the alternative rendering, "<span class="accented">to</span> prove the things that differ" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ</span>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> according to the common derivation (from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, sunlight, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>), means "judged in the full light of the sun," that is, pure, true; comp. <a href="../../par/john/2-21.htm">John 2:21</a>, "He that doeth truth cometh  to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." According to another possible derivation, the word would mean "unmixed," that is, genuine, sincere. "Without offense" may be taken actively or passively; without giving offense (causing stumbling) to others, or without stumbling themselves. Perhaps the latter sense is more suitable here. He prays that the Philippians may be true and pure inwardly, and blameless in their outward lives. "Till," rather, "against the day of Christ." The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> does not denote time only, as <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in Ver. 6; it implies preparation.

The best manuscripts read "fruit." He prays that their love may abound, not only in knowledge and discernment, but also in the fruit of holy living. The fruit of righteousness is sanctification, which springs from justification, and manifests itself in holy living (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are by Jesus Christ</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through.</span> The righteousness of God's saints is not that" which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ" (comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>).

It is his life, living in, assimilated by the Christian soul, which brings forth the fruit of righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the glory and praise of God.</span> The righteousness of God's saints, springing from the abiding presence of Christ, shows forth the glory of God. The glory of God is his majesty in itself; praise is the acknowledgment of this majesty by the voice and heart of man. The glory of God is the end of all Christian effort.

After thanksgiving and prayer, St. Paul turns to his own imprisonment at Rome. That imprisonment, he says, has resulted in the furtherance of the gospel, rather than, as might have been expected, in its hindrance.

But at Rome the name so used would give unnecessary offense, and there is no proof that it was ever used for the palatium there. St. Paul must have heard it constantly as the name of the Praetorian regiment; he was kept chained to a soldier of that corps (<a href="../../par/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16</a>); and as his guard was continually relieved, his name and sufferings for Christ would become gradually known throughout the force. Others, on the authority of a passage in Dion Cassius, understand the word of the barracks of that part of the Praetorian guard attached to the imperial residence on the Palatine. But the passage relates to the time of Augustus, before the Praetorian cohorts were established by Tiberius in the camp outside of the Colline Gate. <span class="cmt_word">And in all other places</span>; rather, as R.V. <span class="accented">and to all the rest</span>; generally, that is, throughout the city.

As the prayer ascends, says Bengel, the supply of the Spirit descends; comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>, "He that ministereth ['supplieth,' R.V.] to you the Spirit." The Spirit is the supply; the Lord Jesus sends the quickening Spirit from the Father. Others, as Meyer, make the genitive subjective, and interpret "the aid which the Spirit supplies." The Spirit is here called "the Spirit of Jesus Christ" - "proceeding from the Father <span class="accented">and the Son."</span> So also <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a> (in the true reading), "the Spirit of Jesus."

The Greek word for "earnest expectation," which occurs also in <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, means literally, a watching with outstretched head, with the attention concentrated on one object, and turned away from all others. Neither his sufferings nor the opposition of the Judaizers will put him to shame. <span class="cmt_word">But that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span> <span class="accented">After</span> " <span class="accented">boldness"</span> (<span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">boldness of speech</span>) we should expect the active form, "I shall magnify." St. Paul, in his humility, prefers the pasture, "Christ shall be magnified." Boldness of speech was to be his part, the glory should be Christ's. Whatever the issue might be, whether a life of Christian labor or a martyr's death, it would be well. The apostles were not omniscient, says Bengel, in relation to their own future lot; they lived in faith and hope.

Others, as Calvin, render (not so well), "For to me Christ is gain both in life and in death." The alternative suggested in Ver. 20 leads St. Paul to a short digression on the comparative advantages of life and death; he is content with either. Life is blessed, for it is Christ; comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4</a>, "Christ, who is our Life," and Galatians it. 20, "Not I, but Christ liveth in me;" "Quit-quid rive, Christum vivo" (Bengel). The life of Christ lives, breathes, energizes, in the life of his saints. His flesh, his incarnate life is their meat; his blood, the mystery of his atonement, is the drink of their souls. He abideth in them, and they in him. And yet death is gain; the slate of death, not the act of dying, is meant (the infinitive is aorist, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>), for the dead in Christ are at home with the Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in a far more blessed sense than the saints on earth.

St. Paul wavers between his own personal longing for rest in Paradise with Christ, and the thought that the continuance of his life on earth might conduce to the spreading of the gospel. The grammar of the Greek sentence aptly represents the apostle's hesitation. The  construction is almost hopelessly confused. Perhaps the interpretation of the R.V. is the simplest: "But if to live in the flesh, - if this is the fruit of my work, then what shall choose I wot not." Thus <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is parallel with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Ver. 21); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;</span> is also a gain, a fruit; the genitive is one of apposition; the work itself is the fruit. St. Paul, says Bengel, regards his work as fruit, others seek fruit from their work. Bishop Lightfoot proposes another rendering, "But what if my living in the flesh will bear fruit, etc.? In fact what to choose I know not." Surely, says Bengel, the Christian's lot is excellent; he can hesitate only in the choice of blessings; disappointed he cannot be.

Being persuaded of this, that my life is needful for you; or, as others render, "And this I certainly, confidently know." The first translation seems preferable, for St. Paul's assurance does not seem to rest on direct inspiration, but on a calculation of probabilities.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28</a></div><div class="verse">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries</span>; literally, snared, as a frightened horse. <span class="cmt_word">Which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation</span>; translate, <span class="accented">seeing that it</span> (<span class="accented">your courage</span>) <span class="accented">is to them an evident token of perdition</span>, <span class="accented">but</span> (with the best manuscripts) <span class="accented">of your salvation.</span> And that of God. These words are to be taken with "an evident token." The courage of God's saints in the midst of dangers is a proof of his presence and favor, a token of final victory (comp. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a></div><div class="verse">For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake</span>. On you it was conferred (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) as a gracious gift, a free spontaneous act of Divine bounty. Faith in Christ is the gift of God, so is "the fellowship of his sufferings." It is not a burden, but a privilege:" In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a></div><div class="verse">Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear <i>to be</i> in me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me</span>. These words are best taken with Ver. 27, vers. 28 and 29 being parenthetical. The apostle returns to the military or gladiatorial metaphor of a contest, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>. He had himself been persecuted at Philippi (<a href="../../par/acts/16.htm">Acts 16</a>:<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>); now the Philippians heard of his Roman imprisonment, and were themselves suffering similar persecutions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ephesians/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ephesians 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ephesians 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../philippians/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Philippians 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Philippians 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
