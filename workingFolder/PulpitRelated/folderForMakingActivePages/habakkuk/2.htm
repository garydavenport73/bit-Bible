As a watchman goes to a high place to see all around and discern what is coming, so the prophet places himself apart from men, perhaps in some secluded height, in readiness to hear the voice of God and seize the meaning of the coming event.

The common explanation of these words (unfortunately perpetuated by Keble's well known hymn, "There is a book, who runs may read"), viz. that even the runner, one who hastens by hurriedly, may be able to read it, is not borne out by the Hebrew, which rather means that every one who reads it may run, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> read fluently and easily. So Jerome, "Scribere jubetur planius, ut possit lector currere, et nullo impedimento velocitas ejus et legendi cupido teneatur." Henderson, comparing <a href="../../par/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, "Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased," interprets the clause to signify that whosoever reads the announcement might run and publish it to all within his reach. "' To run,'" he adds, "is equivalent to 'to prophesy' in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-21.htm">Jeremiah 23:21</a>," on the principle that those who were charged with a Divine message were to use all despatch in making it known. In the passage of Daniel, "to run to and fro," is explained to mean "to peruse."

One who is proud, presumptuous, thinks much of himself, despising others, and is not straightforward and upright before God, shall not live, shall not have a happy, safe life; he carries in himself the seeds of destruction. The result is not expressed in the first hemistich, but may be supplied from the next clause, and, as Knabenbauer suggests, may be inferred from the language in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38, 39</a>, where, after quoting the Septuagint rendering of this passage, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, the writer adds, "But we are not of them that shrink back (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) unto perdition." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ecce</span>, <span class="accented">qui incredulus est, non erit recta anima ejus in semetipso</span>, which seems to confine the statement to the case of one who doubts God's word. <span class="cmt_word">But the just shall live by his faith.</span> The "faith" here spoken of is a loving trust in God, confidence in his promises, resulting in due performance of his will. This hemistich is the antithesis to the former. The proud and perverse, those who wish to be independent of God, shall perish; but, on the other hand, the righteous shall live and be saved through his faith, on the condition that he puts his trust in God. The Hebrew accents forbid the union, "the just by faith," though, of course, no one can be just, righteous, without faith. The passage may be emphasized by rendering, "As to the just, through his faith he shall live." This famous sentence, which St. Paul has used as the basis of his great argument (<a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>), in its literal and contextual application implies that the righteous man will have perfect trust in God's promises and will be rewarded by being safe in the day of tribulation, with reference to the coming trouble at the hands of the Chaldeans. When the proud, greedy kingdom shall have sunk in ruin, the faithful people shall live secure. But the application is not confined to this circumstance. The promise looks beyond the temporal future of the Chaldeans and Israelites, and unto a reward that is eternal. We see how naturally the principle here enunciated is applied by the apostle to teach the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ. The LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x2c;&#x3b5;&#x2e;</span> "by faith in me." The Speaker is God. St. Paul omits <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Habakkuk gathers into one sentence the whole principle of the Law, and indeed all true religion.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quomodo vinum potantem decipit.</span> There is no word expressive of comparison in the original, though it may be supplied to complete the sense. The intemperate habits of the Babylonians are well attested (see <a href="../../par/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3, 4</a>; Quint. Curt., 5:1, "Babylonii maxime in vinum et quae ebrietatem sequuntur effusi sunt;" comp. Her., 1:191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:5. 15). They used beth the fermented sap of the palm tree as well as the juice of the grape, the latter chiefly imported from abroad. "The wealthy Babylonians were fond of drinking to excess; their banquets were magnificent,  but generally ended in drunkenness" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Men.,' 3:450, edit. 1865). Neither the Septuagint, nor the Syriac, nor the Coptic Version has any mention of wine in this passage. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "the arrogant and the scorner." <span class="cmt_word">He is a proud man, neither keepeth he at home;</span> <span class="accented">a haughty man, he resteth not.</span> His pride is always impelling him to new raids and conquests. This is quite the character of the later Chaldeans, and is consistent with the latter part of the verse. The comparison, then, is this: As wine raises the spirits and excites men to great efforts which in the end deceive them, so pride rouses these men to go on their insatiate course of conquest, which shall one day prove their ruin. The verb translated "keepeth at home" has the secondary sense of "being decorous;" hence the Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Sic</span> <span class="accented">erit vir superbus, et non decorabitur</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as wine first exhilarates and then makes a man contemptible, so pride, which begins by exalting a man, ends by bringing him to ignominy. Others take the verb in the sense of "continueth not," explaining that the destruction of Babylon is here intimated. But what follows makes against this interpretation. The LXX. gives, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, which Jerome, combining with it his own version, paraphrases, "Sic vir superbus non decorabitur, nec voluntatem suam perducet ad finem; et juxta Symmachum, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, hoc est, in rerum omnium erit penuria." <span class="cmt_word">Who enlargeth his desire as hell;</span> Hebrew, Sheol.

So the two terms signify "a speech containing enigmas," or a song which has double or ambiguous meanings (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-6.htm">Proverbs 1:6</a>).

The Greek Version seems to point to the weight of the yoke imposed by the Chaldeans on them; but Jerome explains it differently, "Ad hoc tantum saevit ut devoret et iniquitatis et praedarum onere quasi gravissima torque se deprimat." The difficulty lies in the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;</span>, which forms an enigma, or dark saying, because, taken as two words, it might pass current for "thick clay," or "a mass of dirt," while regarded as one word it means "a mass of pledges," "many pledges." That the latter is the signification primarily intended is the view of many modern commentators, who explain the clause thus: The quantity of treasure and booty amassed by the Chaldeans is regarded as a mass of pledges taken from the conquered nations a burden of debt to be discharged one day with heavy retribution. Pusey, "He does in truth <span class="accented">increase against himself a strong pledge</span>, whereby not others are debtors to him, but he is a debtor to Almighty God, who careth for the oppressed (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>)."

Some see in the words an allusion to the formidable fortifications raised by Nebuchadnezzar for the protection of Babylon, and the wonderful palace erected by him as a royal residence (see Rawlinson, 'Ant.

Compare another application of the expression in <a href="../../par/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>.

It is explained as above by St. Jerome, being referred to a verb meaning "to bind." Thus Symmachus and Theodotion translate it by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Henderson and others think it means "a half brick," and Aquila renders it by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span>, "something baked." But we have no evidence that the Babylonians in their sumptuous edifices interlaced timber and half bricks (see Pusey, p. 419, note 23). The  LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, a beetle, a worm, from the wood. Hence, referring to Christ on the cross, St. Ambrose ('Orat. de Obit. Theod.,' 46) writes, "Adoravit ilium qui pependit in ligno, illum inquam qui sicut scarabaeus clamavit, ut persecutoribus suis peccata condonaret." St. Cyril argues that tie beams were called <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> from their clinging to and supporting wall or roof.

That mercy was not an attribute of Nebuchadnezzar we learn from Daniel's advice to him (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>). The captives and deported inhabitants of conquered countries were used as slaves in these public works (see an illustration of this from Koyunjik, Rawlinson's 'Anc. Men.,' 1:497). What was true of Assyria was no less true of Babylon. Professor Rawlinson (2:528, etc.) tells of the extreme misery and almost entire ruin of subject kingdoms. Not only are lands wasted, cattle and effects carried off, the people punished by the beheading or impalement of hundreds or thousands, but sometimes wholesale deportation of the inhabitants is practised, tons or hundreds of thousands being carried away captive. "The military successes of the Babylonians," he says (3:332), "were accompanied with needless violence, and with outrages not unusual in the East, which the historian must nevertheless regard as at once crimes and follies. The transplantation of conquered races may, perhaps, have been morally defensible, notwithstanding the sufferings which it involved. But the mutilations of prisoners, the weary imprisonments, the massacre of non-combatants, the refinement of cruelty shown in the execution of children before the eyes of their fathers, - these and similar atrocities, which are recorded of the Babylonians, are wholly without excuse, since they did not so much terrify as exasperate the conquered nations, and thus rather endangered than added strength or security to the empire. A savage and inhuman temper is betrayed by these harsh punishments, one that led its possessors to sacrifice interest to vengeance, and the peace of a kingdom to a tiger-like thirst for blood...we cannot be surprised that, when final judgment was denounced against Babylon, it was declared to be sent in a great measure 'because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwelt therein.'"

This is cue of the passages which attests "the community of testimony," as it is called, among the prophets. To take a few out of many cases that offer, <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> compared with <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a> with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> with <a href="../../par/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a> with <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a> with <a href="../../par/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a> (Ladd, 'Doctrine of Scripture,' 1:145). All the earth is to be filled with, and to recognize, the glory of God as manifested in the overthrow of ungodliness; and therefore Babylon, and the world power of which she is a type, must be subdued and perish. This announcement looks forward to the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which "shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and shall stand forever" (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). We must remember how intimately in the minds of Eastern heathens the prosperity of a nation was connected with its local deities. Nothing in their eyes could show more perfectly the impotence of a god than his failing to protect his worshippers from destruction (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33</a>, etc.). The glory of Jehovah and his sovereignty over the earth would be seen and acknowledged in the overthrow of Babylon, the powerful, victorious nation. As the waters cover the sea.

The literal drunkenness of the Chaldeans is not the point here. <span class="cmt_word">That puttest thy bottle to him.</span> If this translation is received, the clause is merely a strengthened repetition of the preceding with a sudden change of person. But it may be rendered, "pouring out, or mixing, thy fury," or, as Jerome, "mittens fel suum," "adding thy poison thereto." This last version seems most suitable, introducing a kind of climax, the "poison" being some drug added to increase the intoxicating power. Thus: he gives his neighbour drink, and this drugged, and in the end makes him drunken also. For the second clause the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span>, <span class="accented">subversione turbida</span> and the versions collected by Jerome are only unanimous in differing from one another That thou mayest look on their nakedness.
