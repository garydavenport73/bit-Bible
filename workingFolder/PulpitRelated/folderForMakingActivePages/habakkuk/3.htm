The Revised Version gives, "set to Shigionoth;" and the expression is best explained to mean, in an impassioned or triumphal strain, with rapid change of emotion, a dithy rambic song - a description which admirably suits this ode. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Habakkuk 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <i>and</i> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The proemium, in which the prophet expresses his fear at the coming judgment, and prays God in his wrath to</span> remember mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Thy speech;</span> or, <span class="accented">the report of thee</span>; the declaration made by God in the preceding chapters concerning the punishment of the Jews and the destruction of the Chaldeans. The LXX., regarding the ambiguity of the Hebrew, gives a double rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "I heard thy report," and "I considered thy works." Pusey considers that both meanings are intended, viz. both what God had lately declared, and all that might be heard of God, his greatness and his workings. <span class="cmt_word">Was afraid.</span> The revelation of God's interposition makes the prophet tremble. <span class="cmt_word">Revive thy work.</span> God's work is the twofold judgment spoken of above; and the prophet prays God to "quicken" and make it live, because, though it brings temporary distress upon his countrymen, it will also cause the destruction of their enemies, and re-establish the Jews and crown them with salvation, and make the glory of God known to all the earth. Dr. Briggs ('Messianic Prophecy,' p. 234) translates, "Jahveh, I have heard the report of thee; I fear, Jahveh, thy work. In the midst of the years revive him (Israel)." He explains God's "work" to be his acts in theophany - his judgment, especially as in ver. 16, the cause of fear to the psalmist. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the years.</span> The "years" are the period between the announcement of the judgment and its final accomplishment (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>); the prophet prays that God would manifest his power, not merely at the extreme limit of this epoch, but earlier, sooner. This overthrow of the world power forms, as it were, the central point of history, the beginning of a new age which shall culminate in the Messianic kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Make known.</span> Let all the earth know and acknowledge thy work. The LXX. have given two or more versions of this passage, one of which is remarkable. Thus they read, "In the midst of two animals (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) thou shalt be known; when the years draw nigh thou shalt be well known; when the time is come thou shalt be revealed." The rendering, "two animals," arises from a confusion of words  but many of the Fathers, who were conversant with the Greek Scriptures, saw herein a reference to the incarnation of our blessed Lord, as lying in the stable at Bethlehem between the ox and the ass, which was the mystical explanation of <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." Others interpreted the two animals of the two thieves between whom Christ was crucified; or of angels and men; or Jews and Gentiles; or the two Testaments; or Moses and Elias. Others again accented the word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> so as to understand "two lives," the present and the future, in the midst of which the Judge shall appear; or the life of Christ before his death and after his resurrection. There is a great truth underlying most of these interpretations, namely, that this magnificent hymn is concerned with the victories of Christ and his Church. In wrath remember mercy. When thine anger is displayed by sending the Chaldeans against us, remember thy mercy, and make a speedy end of our misery, and mitigate our enemies' cruelty (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>; and vers. 9, 13, 18, 19 of this chapter). The LXX. gives a double version, "In the troubling of my soul, in wrath, thou wilt remember mercy." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-15.</span> - &sect; 3. <span class="accented">The prophet or the congregation depicts in a majestic theophany the coming of God to judge the world, and its effect symbolically on material nature, and properly on evil men.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - In this episode Habakkuk takes his imagery from the accounts of God's dealings with his people in old time, in Egypt, at the Red Sea, at Sinai, at the Jordan, in Canaan; he echoes the songs of Moses and Deborah and the psalmist; and he looks on all these mighty deeds as antici-pative of God's great work, the overthrow of all that opposes and the establishment of the kingdom of Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="accented">Eloah</span>) <span class="cmt_word">came from Teman.</span> The words are connected with Moses' description of the Lord's appearance at Sinai (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). As he then came in glory to make a covenant with his people, so will he appear again in majesty to deliver them from the power of evil and to execute judgment. The verbs throughout are best rendered in the present. The prophet takes his stand in time preceding the action of the verb, and hence uses the future tense, thus also showing that he is prophesying of a great event to come, symbolized by these earlier manifestations. Habakkuk here and in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> trees the word <span class="accented">Eloah</span>, which is not found in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or the other minor prophets; it occurs once in Isaiah, twice in Deuteronomy, and frequently in Job. There is no ground for the contention that its employment belongs to the latest stage of Hebrew. <span class="accented">Teman</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Edom; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ab Austro</span> (see notes on Amos 1:12 and <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>). In Moses' song the Lord is said to come from Sinai. Habakkuk omits Sinai, says Pusey which was the emblem of the Law, and points to another Lawgiver, like unto Moses, telling how he who spake the Law, God. should come in the likeness of man. The Holy One. A name of God (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>), implying that he will not let iniquity pass unpunished, and that he will preserve the holy seed. <span class="cmt_word">Mount Paran.</span> The mountainous district on the northeast of the desert of <span class="accented">Et-Tih.</span> The glory of the Lord is represented as flashing on the two hilly regions separated by the Arabah. They both lay south of Canaan; and there is propriety in representing the redeemer and deliverer appearing in the south, as the Chaldean invader comes from the north. The LXX. adds two translations of the word "Pharan," viz. "shady," "rough;" according to its etymology it might also mean "lovely." <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. This term occurs also in vers. 9, 13, and frequently in the Psalms, but nowhere else, and indicates some change in the music when the ode was sung in the temple service. What is the exact change is a matter of great uncertainty. Some take it to indicate "a pause;" others, connecting it with <span class="accented">salah</span>, "to lift up," render it "elevation," and suppose it means the raising of the voice, or the strengthening of the accompaniment, as by the blast of trumpets. The meaning must be left undetermined, though it must be added that it is always found at the end of a verse or hemistich, where there is a pause or break in the thought, or, as some say, some strongly accented words occur. <span class="cmt_word">His glory covered the heavens.</span> His majestic brightness spread over the heavens, dimming the gleam of sun and stars; or it may mean his boundless majesty fills the highest heavens and encompasses its inhabitants. His praise. This is usually explained to signify that the earth and all that dwell therein, at this glorious manifestion, utter their praise. But there is no allusion as yet to the manner in which the appearance is received, and in ver. 6 it produces fear and trembling; so it is best to take "praise" in the sense of "matter of praise," that glory "which was calculated to call forth universal adoration" (Henderson). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>his</i> brightness was as the light; he had horns <i>coming</i> out of his hand: and there <i>was</i> the hiding of his power.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His brightness was as the light;</span> <span class="accented">brightness appeareth like light</span>, The sunlight is meant, as <a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-21.htm">Job 37:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He had horns coming out of his hand;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rays of light on either side. The comparison of the first rays of light to the horns of the gazelle, according to Keil,  is common in Arabic poetry (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). In the original passage, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, we read, "At his right hand was a fiery Law unto them" - a reference to the two tables of stone, perhaps resplendent with light. The "hand" in our text is a general expression, and is not to be taken with any special reference to lightning launched by the hand (which is not a scriptural expression), nor to works effected by God's agency, but simply as signifying that the light of his presence streamed forth from both sides, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> everywhere. <span class="cmt_word">There was the hiding of his power.</span> There, in that ineffable light, was the hiding place of his majesty. He clothes himself with light as with a garment (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>), and the splendour is the mantle of that presence which eye of man cannot behold (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - After describing the splendour of the theophany, the prophet now turns to the purpose and effects of God's appearing. He comes to avenge and judge, therefore <span class="cmt_word">before him went the pestilence.</span> Before him stalks plague, to punish his enemies and the disobedient, as in Egypt, in Canaan (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-9.htm">1 Samuel 5:9, 11</a>); and among his own people (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>). For "pestilence" the LXX. reads "word." Burning coals went forth at his feet. "Fiery belts" followed his advance, "hailstones and coals of fire" (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12, 13</a>); as in <a href="../../par/psalms/97-8.htm">Psalm 97:8</a>, "A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies on every side." But, regarding the parallelisms of the hemistiches, it is better to take <span class="accented">resheph</span> in the sense of "fever heat," as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>; scorching fever follows in his train. Jerome translates the word, <span class="accented">diabolus</span>, looking on the evil spirit as the agent of the Divine vengeance. The Jews, he says, had a tradition that Satan was called <span class="accented">Reseph</span>, from the speed of his movements. The LXX. has, "It (the word) shall go forth into the plains," which Jerome interprets, "shall make the crooked straight and the rough ways smooth."

"He reneweth his progresses of old time" (Delitzsch). The eternal, unchangeable purpose and operation of God are contrasted with the disruption of "the everlasting hills."

In the Assyrian monuments the bow case forms part of the quiver, and holds only the lower half of the bow (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Mon.,' 2:55, edit. 1864). It was fastened to the side of the chariot or carried at the back of the archer.

The Revised Version gives," The oaths to the tribes were a sure word;" in the margin, "Sworn were the chastisements (Hebrew, 'rods') of thy word." Thus Dr. Briggs: "Sworn are the rods of thy word." Orelli translates," Oaths, rods of the word," and explains the clause to mean that the Lord comes to execute the denounced punishment, which proceeds from his mouth like chastising rods. The word <span class="accented">mattoth</span> is translated "tribes" (as in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a>) or "rods." Keil contends for the latter, as instruments of chastisement, rendering," Rods are sworn by word" Henderson, taking the words as a military signal, curiously translates, "'Sevens of spears' was the word." Pusey supports the Authorized Version, which, indeed. gives a good sense, and is probably correct It is virtually supported by Jerome, who has, "Suscitans suscitabis arcum tuum, juramenta tribubus quae locutus es," "Thou wilt awaken the oaths," which, so long as the evil prospered, seemed to be forgotten and sleeping. The LXX. emits the word rendered "oaths," and translates <span class="accented">mattoth</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Thou didst surely bend thy bow against sceptres." <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>.

If the signification of the word "with" (<span class="accented">eth</span>) be pressed, the passage is taken to mean that, as God manifested himself in old time for the salvation of his people with his chosen "Christ," Moses; so he will hereafter reveal his power for the destruction of the Chaldeans with his chosen "Christ," Cyrus. But this is too definite, and cannot be shown to be intended. The "anointed one," again, is not the nation of Israel, for the term is always applied to a single individual and never to the people collectively; so here it is the theocratic king who is meant - first, the representative of David; and secondly, the Messiah. God reveals himself for the salvation of his people in union with the work especially of his anointed Son, Christ. This is how the passage is taken by Eusebius ('Dem. Evang.,' 4:16), <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. It must be confessed, however, that most modern commentaters translate, "for the salvation of thy anointed," taking the last expression (contrary to all usage) to mean the Israelites, as being a kingdom and nation of priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). In this case the present clause is merely a repetition of the preceding one. <span class="cmt_word">Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked;</span> <span class="accented">thou</span> <span class="accented">dashest in pieces the head</span>. As in the following clause the metaphor of a house is plainly employed, "the head" must be taken for the gable or topmost ridge. "The house of the wicked" is an allegorical description of the Chaldaic dominion and its king; and the prophet declares that God will smite with destruction both the ungodly monarch and the kingdom that opposes itself. Some commentators see here an allusion to the primeval sentence (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>): others to the destruction of the Egyptians' firstborn; others to the incident of Jael and Sisera (<a href="../../par/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>). If the prophet's language was influenced by any of these matters, his view and his oracle are concerned with the mighty future. The LXX. has, "Thou wilt east death upon the heads of the evil." <span class="cmt_word">By discovering</span> (literally, <span class="accented">making naked</span>) t<span class="cmt_word">he foundations unto the neck</span>. "By" is better omitted. Keil supposes that "the neck" is the central part of the house, looking from the gable downwards; though why this should be so called is not apparent; and the wording of the original, "the foundations even to the neck," compels us to connect the two words together, and will not allow us to interpret "the neck" of some higher part of the building. The general meaning is plain - the metaphorical house is destroyed from summit to base, the destruction beginning at the gable is carried on to the very foundations According to this view, "the neck" should mean the very lowest basis of the walls. Henderson (after Capellus and others) suggests that we should read "rock," a word derived from the same root. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Thou didst raise chains unto the neck." It is possible that the mention of "the  head," just above, has led the prophet to use the term "neck" in order to express the utter destruction of the whole body. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. Another solemn pause ensues. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <i>was</i> as to devour the poor secretly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst strike through with his staves;</span> <span class="accented">thou didst pierce with his own spears.</span> Thou dost turn on the Chaldeans and all thine enemies the destruction which they intended for others.

There is a difficulty in arriving at the meaning of this last word. The LXX. renders it, "mighty men;" Jerome, "warriors;" Chaldee, "army;" Delitzsch and many modern critics, "hordes" or "inhabitants of the plain;" others again, "rulers" or "judges."

It is obvious to  remark that this is a gloss, not on the original text, but on the erroneous version.

The Chaldeans, like the Assyrians and Egyptians, cut down and burnt the fruit-bearing trees of the countries which they invaded (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a>).

The flock shall be cut off from the fold. There shall be no flocks in the fold, all having perished for lack of food. "Omnia haec," says St. Jerome, "auferentur a populo, quia inique egit in Deum creatorem suum."

The psalmist often thus shews his exulting faith (see <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will joy.</span> I will shout for joy; my joy shall express itself outwardly. <span class="cmt_word">The God of my salvation</span> (see note on Micah 7:7).

This is a musical direction, answering to the heading in ver. 1, and implies that the ode is committed to the conductor of the temple music, to be by him adapted for the public service to the accompaniment of stringed instruments. Such directions are elsewhere always found at the beginning, not the end, of psalms (see <a href="../../par/psalms/4.htm">Psalm 4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/6.htm">Psalm 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/67.htm">Psalm 67</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/76.htm">Psalm 76</a>.). It has been thought that the suffix of the first person, "my stringed instruments," denotes that Habakkuk had a right to take part in the temple service, and was therefore a Levite; but it is very doubtful whether this suffix is not a clerical error, as Kuenen and Ewald suppose, or merely paragogic. Certainly neither the Greek, Latin, nor Syriac Versions afford it any confirmation. These versions make the subscription part of the ode.
