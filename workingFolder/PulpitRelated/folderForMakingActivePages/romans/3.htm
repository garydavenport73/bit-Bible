Some difficulty in determining his exact meaning arises from the concise and pregnant form in which the objections are put and answered, and from fresh ones arising out of the answers, which have also to be met. The objections are from the Jewish standpoint, though not put into the mouth of an objecting Jew, but rather suggested as likely ones by St. Paul himself. To the original readers of the Epistle, who were familiar with the tone of Jewish thought, the sequence of the ideas would probably be more obvious than to us. Reserving special consideration of successive clauses for our exposition of each verse, we may, in the first place, exhibit thus the general drift. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 1 (ver. 1). If being a Jew, if circumcision itself, gives one no advantage over the Gentile, what was the use of the old covenant at all? It is thus shown to have been illusory; and God's own truth and faithfulness are impugned, if he is supposed to have given, as conveying advantages, what really conveyed none. (This last thought, though not expressed, must be supposed to be implied in the objection, since it is replied to in the answer.) <span class="accented">Answer</span> (vers. 2-4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was not illusory; it did convey great advantages in the way of <span class="accented">privilege and opportunity</span>; this advantage first, not to mention other. that "the oracles of God" were entrusted to the Jew. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if some (more or fewer, it matters not) have failed to realize these advantages, it has been their fault, not God's. It is man's unfaithfulness, not his, that has been the cause of the failure. Nay, though, according to the hasty saying of the psalmist, <span class="accented">all men</span> were false, God's truth remains; nay, further, as is expressed in another psalm (<a href="../../par/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.), man's very unfaithfulness is found to commend his faithfulness the more, and redound to his greater glory. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 2 (ver. 5). Based on the last assertion. But if man's unfaithfulness has this result, how can God, consistently with his justice, be wrath with us and punish us for it? Surely the Jew (whose case we are now considering) may claim exemption from "the wrath" of God spoken of above, his unfaithfulness being allowed to have served only to establish God's truth and to enhance his glory. <span class="accented">Answer</span> (ver. 6-8). I have suggested this objection as though the matter could be regarded from a mere human point of view, as though it were one between man and man; for it is true that a man cannot justly take vengeance on another who has not really harmed him. But such a view is inapplicable to God in his dealings with man; it does not touch our doctrine of his righteous wrath against sin as such. I can only meet it with a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it would preclude God from judging the world at all, as we all believe he will do. Any <span class="accented">heathen</span> sinner might put in the same plea, saying, Why am I too (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>) judged as a sinner? Nay, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> since it involves the principle of sin being evil, not in itself, but only with regard to its consequences, it would, if carried out, justify the odious view (which we Christians are by some falsely accused of holding) that we may do evil that good may come. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What advantage then hath the Jew! or what is the profit of circumcision! Much</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;</span>, a neuter adjective, agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">every way</span> (not <span class="accented">by all means</span>; the meaning is that in all respects the position of the Jew is an advantageous one): <span class="cmt_word">first</span> (rather than <span class="accented">chiefly</span>, as in the Authorized Version. One point of advantage is specified, which might have been followed by a <span class="accented">secondly</span> and a <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, etc. But the writer stops here, the mention of this <span class="accented">first</span> being sufficient for his purpose. Others are enumerated, so as to elucidate the purport of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in ch. 9:4, 5) <span class="cmt_word">for that they</span> (the Jews) <span class="cmt_word">were entrusted with the oracles of God</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (always used in the plural in the New Testament) occurs also in <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>. Of these passages the most apposite is <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>, where the Divine communications to Moses on Mount Sinai are spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16</a>, where Balaam speaks of himself as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). Some (as Meyer), in view of the supposed, reference in the following verse to the Jews rejection of the gospel, take the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> here to mean especially the revealed promises of the Redeemer. But neither the word itself nor its use elsewhere suggests any such limited meaning; nor does the context really require it. It may denote generally the Divine revelations of the Old Testament, which, for the eventual benefit of mankind, had been entrusted exclusively to the Jews.

The expression does net denote whether many or few; it only avoids assertion of universality of unbelief (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7</a>), though it is implied in the following verso that, even if it had been universal, the argument would stand) <span class="cmt_word">did not believe?</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</span> Alford renders <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> "were unfaithful," taking it in the sense of being "unfaithful to the covenant, the very condition of which was to walk in the ways of the Lord, and observe his statutes;" and this on the ground that the apostle is not as yet speaking of faith or the want of it, but, in accordance with the idea of the preceding chapter, of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 5) and moral guilt. But the meaning of words must not be forced to meet the views of interpreters; and we observe that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are ever elsewhere used in their proper sense to denote want of <span class="accented">faith</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-11.htm">Mark 16:11, 14, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>, 41; <a href="../../par/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>). Still, it is to be observed that in the passage before us <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in man is opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in God, so as to suggest a more general sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> than mere <span class="accented">unbelief.</span> In view of this opposition, we may adopt the rendering of the whole passage in the Revised Version: "What if some were without faith? Shall their want of faith," etc.? Meyer and others, understanding (as said above) by <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> the Divine oracles which were prophetic of Christ, refer <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> exclusively to the disbelief in him on the part of the majority of the Jews at the time of writing. But the aorist tense of the verb, as well as the context, is against the idea of such reference, at any rate exclusively. The context, both in ch. 2. and the latter part of this chapter after ver. 9, certainly suggests rather reference to the failure of the Jews throughout their history to realize the advantage of their privileged position; and this failure might properly be attributed to their want of faith, to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>), cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-2.htm">Hebrews 4:2</a>, together with <a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in these passages is regarded as the root of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. On the other hand, the whole drift of ch. 11. in this Epistle - where the <span class="accented">present</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the chosen people shown in their rejection of the gospel is spoken of as not hindering, but furthering, the righteous purpose of God, and redounding in the end to his glory - suggests a like reference here. And it may have been in the apostle's mind, though, for the reasons above given, it can hardly be the only one in the passage before us.

The apostle takes this phrase from it as expressing well what he wants to say, viz. that though <span class="accented">all</span> men were false (in the sense expressed and implied by the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), yet God's truth stands. But it only leads up to the second quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, which is the important one, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. In its final words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, the LXX. is followed (so also Vulgate, <span class="accented">cum</span> <span class="accented">judicaris</span>), though the Hebrew may be more correctly rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "be clear when thou judgest." The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX. may be understood passively in the sense of God being called to account, as men might be, for the justice of his dealings; or, perhaps, in a middle sense for entering into a suit or controversy with his people. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "going to law" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1, 6</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/5-40.htm">Matthew 5:40</a>), and in the LXX., with especial reference to a supposed <span class="accented">controversy</span> or <span class="accented">pleading</span> of God with men, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>.

The meaning of this concluding expression does not, however, affect the main purport of the verse, or its relevancy as here quoted. Occurring in what is believed to be David's penitential psalm after his sin. in the matter of Uriah, it declares, in conjunction with the preceding verse, that, sin having been committed, man alone is guilty, and that God's truth and righteousness can never be impugned. But it seems to imply still more than this, viz. that man's sin has the establishment of God's righteousness as its consequence, or even, it may be, as its purpose; for the conclusion of ver. 4 in the psalm, naturally connected with "against thee only have I sinned" preceding, is so connected by <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> (in Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>); and it is not out of keeping with scriptural doctrine that David should have intended to express even Divine <span class="accented">purpose in</span> that he had been permitted, for his sins, to fall into that deeper sin <span class="accented">with the view of</span> establishing God's righteousness all the more. It does not, however, seem certain (whatever some grammarians may say) that the conjunction need of necessity be understood as <span class="accented">relic</span>; it may be <span class="accented">embatic</span> only. However this be, it is the inference from <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;</span> that suggests the new objection of the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <i>Is</i> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?

Nay, in that case, the apostle goes on to say, he, or any of us, might justify all wrongdoing for a supposed good end. Why not?

For there is nothing in the context to suggest the Gentiles as the speakers, nor does what follow suit the supposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The main question is as to the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, which occurs here only in the New Testament, and has, therefore, to be interpreted from consideration of the sense of which the verb is capable, and the probable drift of the argument. Some have taken it as a passive verb, with the meaning, "Are we surpassed?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are we Jews in <span class="accented">worse</span> case than the Gentiles on account of our greater privileges? The active verb, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of "to excel," being both transitive and intransitive, its passive may be used in the same sense. An instance quoted in commentaries is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Plut., 'Mor.,'), "cum Jove minores non sint." So the recent Revisers, though dissented from by the American Committee. The strong objection to this interpretation is that there has been nothing so far even to suggest any <span class="accented">superiority</span> of the Gentile to the Jew, and that what follows does not bear upon any such idea. Thus to interpret would be to sacrifice the sense to supposed grammatical exigence, which, after all, is uncertain. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> as the middle voice, we have two interpretations before us; either, with Meyer, to render, <span class="accented">Do we put forward</span> (anything) <span class="accented">in our defence? - which</span> he maintains (though not conclusively) to be the only proper sense of the middle verb - or (as in the Authorized Version), <span class="accented">Are we</span> better (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in better ease) <span class="accented">than they?</span> This rendering, though it gives essentially the same sense as if <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (intransitive) had been written, is commended by its suitableness to the course of argument, and the middle voice may, perhaps, he accounted for as denoting the Jews' supposed claim of superiority for themselves. Thus the connection of thought is plain. The conclusion of ch. 2. had left the Jews on the same footing with the Gentiles before God in respect of sinfulness. But then objections had been raised on the ground of the acknowledged privileges of the chosen people; and such objections have been met. The apostle now sums up the result: What, then, is the state of the case? Have we any advantage to allege? No, not at all in the sense intended; the previous argument stands; and he proceeds to confine his position from the testimony of the Old Testament itself.

These texts are from various unconnected passages of the Old Testament, quoted from the LXX., though not all accurately. They seem to be put together from memory by way of showing the general scriptural view of human depravity. It may be said that they do not establish the apostle's position of <span class="accented">all</span> men being guilty; for that they are for the most part rhetorical rather than dogmatic, that most of them refer only to certain classes of men, and that the righteous are spoken of too, and this in the sequence of even the most sweeping of them all (that from <a href="../../par/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. or Psalms 53.), which does, literally understood, assert universal sinfulness. Any such objection to the cogency of the quotations may be met by regarding them as adduced, not as rigid proofs, but as only generally confirmatory of the apostle's position. See, he would say to the Jew, the picture your own Scriptures give you; observe their continued testimony to human depravity: and the main point of all the quotations is that which is brought out in the next verse, viz. that they had reference, not to the Gentile world, but to the chosen people themselves.

In this concluding verse the apostle briefly intimates the reason of law's inefficacy for justification, anticipating, after a manner usual with him, what is afterwards to be more fully set forth, as especially in ch. 7. The reason is that law in itself only defines sin and makes it sinful, but does not emancipate from it.

On the essential meaning of <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), see on Romans 1:17, and Introduction. This passage, in which the thesis of <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> is formally enunciated, is consistent with this meaning; in confirmation of which observe vers. 25, 26, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently means God's own righteousness, as also above, ver. 5. If this view is correct, there is no need to follow commentators into their discussions of the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in supposed connection with the idea of man's <span class="accented">imputed</span> righteousness; such as whether it is meant to declare justification through Christ to be <span class="accented">without the aid</span> of the Law - "sine legis adminiculo" (Calvin) - or to exclude all legal <span class="accented">works</span>, done before, or even after justification, from any share in the office of justification. However true these positions may be, what is said here seems simply to mean that God's righteousness has been manifested in Christ in a different way, and on a different principle, from that of law. The principle of law is to enjoin and forbid, and to require complete obedience; but law, even as exhibited in the Divine Law of the Jews, has been shown to fail to enable man thus to attain to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; therefore, apart from this exacting principle, the righteousness of God is now revealed to man, embracing him in itself. The absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> here, and its insertion in the latter clause of the same verse, where the Mosaic Law is definitely referred to, is fully explained by what has been said above under Romans 2:13. <span class="accented">Being witnessed</span>, etc., is introduced parenthetically by way of intimating that this manifestation of God's righteousness, though "apart from law," is not in any opposition to the teaching of the Law and the prophets, being, in fact, anticipated by them. The proof of this appears afterwards in ch. 4. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">Even the righteousness of God <i>which is</i> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ unto all</span> (<span class="accented">and upon all</span> is added in the Textus Receptus, but ill supported) <span class="cmt_word">them that believe: for there is no distinction.</span> We observe that the expression here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> but simply <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>.

The idea, then, may be still that of God's own righteousness, manifested in Christ, <span class="accented">unto</span> or <span class="accented">towards</span> all believers, who through faith apprehended it and became sharers in it.

It comes immediately after the quotation from <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>, etc., followed by "These things said Esaias, when he saw <span class="accented">his glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), and spoke of him." Hence the meaning of <a href="../../par/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a> may probably be that the persons spoken of loved <span class="accented">mundane</span> glory (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-29.htm">Matthew 6:29</a>) rather than the <span class="accented">Divine</span> glory, seen in the vision of faith, manifested to the world in Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We beheld his glory," etc.), and "loved" by those who have not the eyes blinded and the heart hardened. So, even in the previous passage of St. John's Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/5-41.htm">John 5:41, 44</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> may denote man's participation in the Divine glory, rather than praise or honour, while <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may mean the mundane glory conferred by men on each other. These considerations commend, in the passage before us, the interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Significatur ipsius Dei viventis gloria, <span class="accented">vitam</span> tribuens (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>); ad quam homini, si non peccasset, patuit aditus: sod peccator ab illo fine sue excidit, neque jam eum assequitur, neque gloriam illam, quae in illo effulsisset, ullo mode tolerare potest: <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-20.htm">Hebrews 12:20</a>, et <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>; quo fit ut morti sit obnoxius: nam gloria et immortalitas suut synonyma, et sic mors et corruptio. <span class="accented">Absunt a gloria Dei, i.e.</span> a summo fine homiuis aberrarunt. At justificati recuporant spom illius glorise. Vid. omnino c. 5:2, 11, 17; 8:30, etc." (Bengel). Further, the sense which the same expression seems evidently to bear in <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a> of this Epistle is of importance for our determination of its meaning here. We are not justified in understanding, with some interpreters, any specific reference to the "image of God" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in which man was created, and which has been lost by the Fall, there being nothing to suggest it, or, with others, <span class="accented">exclusively</span> to the future glory, since the present <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> seems to denote a present deficiency. The general conception appears sufficiently plain in Bengel's exposition above given, according to which "the glory of God" means the glory of the Divine righteousness ("sempiterna ejus virtus et divinitas" Bengel on <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), which man, through sin, falls short of.

The means whereby it becomes <span class="accented">objectively</span> possible is "the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." Here, as throughout St. Paul's Epistles, and in the New Testament generally, the doctrine of <span class="accented">atonement</span> being required for man's justification is undoubtedly taught, Christ being viewed as not only manifesting God's righteousness in his life, and reconciling believers through his influence on themselves, but as <span class="accented">effecting</span> such reconciliation by an atoning sacrifice. The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) here used may indeed sometimes denote <span class="accented">deliverance</span> only (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>); but certainly, when used of the redemption of man by Christ, it implies <span class="accented">atonement</span> by the payment of a <span class="accented">ransom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; the ransom paid being said to be <span class="accented">himself</span>, or (as in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>) <span class="accented">his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It does not follow that all conceptions of schools of theology as to how the atonement was efficacious for its purpose are correct or adequate. It must, from the very nature of the subject, remain to us a mystery. It may be enough for us to believe that whatever need the human conscience has ever felt of atonement for sin, whatever human want was expressed by world-wide rites of sacrifice, whatever especially was signified by the blood required for atonement in the Mosaic ritual, - all this is met and fulfilled for us in Christ's offering of himself, and that in him and through him we may now "come boldly to the throne of grace," having need of no other <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x2e;</span> 25 ("set forth," Authorized Version), may bear here its most usual classical sense of <span class="accented">exhibiting to view</span> ("ante omniam oculos possuit," Bengel); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the historical manifestation of the Redeemer. It may, however, mean "decreed," or "purposed" (cf. ch. 1:13; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems best taken as a neuter adjective used substantively, there being no instance of its application in the masculine to a person. Its ordinary use in the LXX (as also <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>) is to designate the lid of the ark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mercy-seat), the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (which is added <a href="../../par/exodus/25-17.htm">Exodus 25:17</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-6.htm">Exodus 37:6</a>) being supposed to be always understood, though the usual designation is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Hence most commentators, including the Greek Fathers generally, understood <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in this sense here, Christ being regarded as the antitype of the mercy-seat, as being the medium of atonement and approach to God. The main objection to this view is that it involves an awkward confusion of metaphors, it being difficult to regard him who was at once the Victim whose blood was offered, and the High Priest who offered his own blood, <span class="accented">at the</span> mercy-seat, as being also the Mercy-seat itself. (Thus, however, Theodoret explains: "The mercy-seat of old was itself <span class="accented">bloodless, being</span> without life, but it received the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice. But the Lord Christ and God is at once Mercy-seat, High Priest, and Lamb.") The difficulty is avoided if we take the word here in the sense of <span class="accented">propitiatory offering</span>, which in itself it will bear, a noun, such as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, being supposed to be (cf. 4 Maccabees 17:22; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 16. c. 7; Dio Chrys., 'Orat.,' 11:1). Whatever its exact meaning, it evidently denotes a true fulfilment in Christ of the atonement for sin undoubtedly signified by the type; as does further <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which follows. For a distinct enunciation of the significance of bleed under the ancient ritual, as reserved for and expressing atonement, see especially <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>. The meaning of the whole sacrificial ritual is there expressed as being that the life of man being forfeit to Divine justice, blood, representing life, must be offered instead of his life for atonement. Hence, in pursuance of this idea, the frequent references in the New Testament to Hebrews physical <span class="accented">blood-shedding</span> of Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"). It is not, however, implied that the material blood of Christ, shed on the cross, in itself cleanses the soul from sin, but only that it signifies to us the fulfilment in him of the type of an atoning sacrifice. As to the construction of ver. 25, it is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is to be taken in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, meaning "through faith in his blood" (an unusual expression, though grammatically correct, cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>), or with <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, such as apparently to signify "in his own blood," favours the latter connection (cf. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-25</a>, where the offering of Christ is distinguished from those of the Law in being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). Thus the meaning will be that he was set forth (or purposed) as an <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, available for us through faith, and consisting in the offering of himself - in, the shedding of his own blood. <span class="cmt_word">For showing of his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime in the forbearance of God, in order to the showing of his righteousness in the time that now is, so that he may be righteous, and justifying</span> (the word is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> preceding) <span class="cmt_word">him that is of faith in Jesus</span>. This translation differs materially from that of the Authorized Version, which is evidently erroneous, especially in the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by "for the remission." Our translators, in a way very unusual with them, seem to have missed the drift of the passage, and so been led to give the above untenable rendering in order to suit their view of it. It is to be observed that two purposes of the <span class="accented">setting forth</span> (or <span class="accented">purposing</span>) of Christ Jesus as <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span> here declared, both denoted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is repeated, being governed in the first clause of the sentence by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, and in the second by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>. Some say that the preposition is changed with no intended difference of meaning. But it is not St. Paul's way to use his prepositions carelessly. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> in the first clause may be taken to denote the immediate purpose of the propitiation, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the second to have its proper significance of <span class="accented">aim</span> or <span class="accented">direction</span>, denoting a further intention and result, consequent on the first. The first purpose, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, was the vindication of God's righteousness with regard to the ages past, in that he had so long <span class="accented">passed over</span>, or left unvisited, the sins of mankind. The propitiation of Christ. at length <span class="accented">set forth</span> (or, as may be expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, all along <span class="accented">purposed</span>), showed that he had not been indifferent to these sins, though <span class="accented">in his forbearance</span> he had passed them over. Cf. <a href="../../par/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, where the death of Christ, as the Mediator of the new covenant, is said to have been "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant," the meaning and efficacy of the "death" being thus regarded, in the first place, as retrospective (cf. also <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). But then there was a further grand purpose, expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the second clause that of providing a way of present justification for believers now, without derogation of the Divine righteousness. Such appears to be the meaning of this passage.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/3-30.htm">Romans 3:30</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing <i>it is</i> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If indeed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, as in the Textus Receptus) <span class="cmt_word">God is one, who shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith</span>. Here the <span class="accented">unity</span> of God is given as the reason of his being the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews. So also, <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is the reason why he wills all men to be saved. It is of importance to grasp St. Paul's idea in his assertions of the <span class="accented">unity</span> of God. It is not that of <span class="accented">numerical</span> unity, but what may be called the unity of <span class="accented">quality</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not a mere assertion of monotheism as against polytheism, but that the one God is one and the same to all, comprehending all in the embrace of his own essential unity. God's unity involved in St. Paul's mind the idea of "One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>); "who made of one blood every nation of men" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>); in whom we (all of us) "live and move and have our being" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). Thus exclusion of the Gentiles from the paternal embrace of the one God is incompatible with the very idea, so conceived, of his unity. In the latter part of this verse it is said that God will justify the circumcision <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the uncircumcision <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, the preposition being changed, and the second <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> being preceded by the article. The difference is not of essential importance, "faith" being the emphatic word. But it is not unmeaning. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;</span> expresses the principle of justification; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, the medium through which it may be had. The Jew was already in a position for justification through the Law leading up to Christ. He had only to accept it as <span class="accented">of faith</span>, and not <span class="accented">of works of law</span> (ver. 20). The Gentile must attain to it <span class="accented">through faith</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his faith in the gospel now revealed to him. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (Theodorus). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a></div><div class="verse">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do we then make law void through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish law</span>. The question naturally arises after what has been said about justification being <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Do we then make out our revealed Law, which we have accounted so holy and Divine, to be valueless? Or. rather, as the question is more generally put (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> being without the article, and therefore translated as above), "Do we make of none effect the whole principle of law, embodied to us in our Divine Law? Regarded erroneously as a principle of <span class="accented">justification</span>, the apostle might have answered. "Yes, we do." But any disparagement of it, regarded in its true light and as answering its real purpose, he meets with an indignant <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. On the contrary, he says, we establish it. Law means the declaration of righteousness, and requirement of conformity to it on the part of man. We establish this principle by our doctrine of the necessity of atonement for man's defect. We put law on its true base, and so make it the more to stand (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) by showing its office to be, not to <span class="accented">justify -</span> a position untenable - but to <span class="accented">convince of sin</span>, and so lead up to Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>). In pursuance of this thought, the apostle, in the next chapter, shows that in the Old Testament itself it is <span class="accented">faith</span>, and not <span class="accented">law</span>, which is regarded as <span class="accented">justifying</span>; as, in the first place and notably, in the case of Abraham; thus proving the previous assertion in <a href="../../par/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. In ch. 7. he treats the subject subjectively, analyzing the operation of law in the human soul, and so bringing out still more clearly its true meaning and purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../romans/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Romans 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Romans 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../romans/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Romans 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Romans 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
