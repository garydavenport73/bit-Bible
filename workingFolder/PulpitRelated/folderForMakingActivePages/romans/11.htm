He answers - No; impossible! God's ancient covenant with his people stands; the remnant of believers even now is a sign of his continued favour to his ancient people, as was, in the time of Elijah, the remnant that had not bowed the knee to Baal; nor does the fact of its being a remnant only imply now, any more than then, that the nation as such is cast off; and further, the calling of the Gentiles, far from being intended to exclude God's ancient people, will be the means eventually of bringing it wholly in. Such is the apostle's prophetic vision of the future, in view of which he bursts at the end of the chapter into glowing admiration of the inscrutable ways of God. In the course of it also (vers. 17-25) he introduces a warning to Gentile believers not to pride themselves against the Jews because of present preference to them, or to regard their own position of privilege as indefeasible. It must still be borne in mind that it is the position before God of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> that is all along in view. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say then, Hath God east away his people!

Only here in the New Testament; but cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/2-12.htm">Matthew 2:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>; also <a href="../../par/luke/2-26.htm">Luke 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>) <span class="cmt_word">unto him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Even so at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace</span>. The usual interpretation of this whole passage, and notably that of the ancients, has been to take the proof of God not having cast off his people as beginning in ver. 1, with "for I also," etc., and all the rest to be in sequence. Chrysostom's explanation of the argument is to the following effect: God has not rejected his ancient people; for I myself am eminently of it; and I have been selected as a chief proclaimer and expounder of the gospel to the world; this would not have been the case if the nation had been cast off. But it may be said to me," You are only one of the ancient people; you are not the people." Nay, but I do not stand alone; there are thousands of Israelite believers as well as myself; and these are God's true people, the people whom he foreknew. And of them there may be more than we are aware of; it is as it was in the days of Elias; he had supposed himself to be left alone; but he was told that there were seven thousand with him who were God's true people still. And so now, there is a faithful remnant, the number of which is known to God alone, which is his people still, according to the election of grace. The same Father further understands the citation of the whole of the passage from <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a>, though not required for the apostle's proof, to be intended as significant. It would have sufficed, he says, to cite only what was said about a remnant being left; but the whole complaint of Elias is cited, so as to show by the way that the present rejection of Christ and persecution of the Church by the majority of the Jews had also its counterpart in ancient times; and thus the apostle, he says, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the unbelieving Jews) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. It is to be observed that the above interpretation of the passage, which in its main points has been most generally adopted, goes on two suppositions; vie. that "for I also<span class="accented"></span>," in ver. 1, is the first part of the proof that Israel is not cast off; and that "which he foreknew," in ver. 2, is intended as a limitation of the meaning of "his people." According to another view, decidedly upheld by Meyer, "for I also" is not part of the proof, but connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>: "I must needs say, God forbid! being myself a Hebrew of the Hebrews" Then, according to this view, comes the positive statement that God has not east off his people in the same general sense as before, after which the proof begins; the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> not being a limitation of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but intended to enforce the idea of the impossibility of the final rejection of the race of Israel (cf. ver. 29; also <a href="../../par/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>). The fact that, throughout the chapter, it is Israel as a nation that is in view, and that the coming of the whole nation into the kingdom of Christ is contemplated in the end, adds decided probability to this view of the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, though <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, etc., in ver. 1, may still be regarded as possibly part of the proof. St. Paul's designation of himself as "of the seed of Abraham" seems meant to express that he was an Israelite of pure descent, not a proselyte or descended from proselytes. In <a href="../../par/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>, as well as here, he specifies his tribe as that of Benjamin, the tribe that with Judah had clung to the house of David, and had shared the privileges of Judah. The quotation from <a href="../../par/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>. is given freely from the LXX., varying a little, but not so as to affect the meaning. One variation is in the feminine, instead of masculine, article before <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span>, which has been explained by supposing <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> understood (so in the Authorized Version, "the <span class="accented">image</span> <span class="accented">of</span> Baal "), or by there having been a female Baal, or by the god having been supposed androgynous, or by the feminine being used of idols in contempt. St. Paul may possibly have found this reading in his copy of the LXX. The variation is of no importance with regard to the drift of the passage. "According to the election of grace," at the end of ver. 5, does not seem to be directly suggested by the passage cited, but added by St. Paul so as to make plain his position - maintained throughout the Epistle, and about to be pressed in this chapter on the consideration of Gentile Christians - that the calling of all, whether Jews or Gentiles, is "of grace," and not claimable as of right by any on the ground of the merit of their own works. And in order to enforce this position, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the word "grace" loses its essential meaning. <span class="cmt_word">[But if of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.]</span> The preponderance of ancient authorities is against the retention of the clause within brackets, which does not seem required. It is the same as in <a href="../../par/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4</a>.

The verb denotes callousness rather than blindness, usually in the New Testament referring to the <span class="accented">heart</span> (cf. especially <a href="../../par/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). And such hardening is no new and strange thing, or to be taken as implying failure of God's promises to his people; for it is but what Scripture tells us of.

It is from the verb which means <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, properly "to prick" (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>). The noun seems to have got its sense as above from the idea of a pricking shock, causing stupefaction<span class="cmt_word">), eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day. And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompense unto them. Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway</span>. The references in ver. 8 are a combination of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, quoted freely from the LXX.; that in ver. 9 is to <a href="../../par/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23, 24</a>, also quoted freely. (For similar combination and free quotation of texts, so as to bring out Old Testament ideas, cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32, 33</a>.) It is not necessary that the passages here referred to should be regarded as directly prophetic of the time of Christ. It is enough for the purpose of the argument that God's people should be shown to be liable to the state of stupefaction described, without ceasing to be his people. And so the thought, which has been in view all along, is now taken up, of the present hardening of Israel as a nation not being intended to be permanent.

If so, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> must mean the defect from such full complement - not. indeed (as some have explained), the small number (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of believers) now opposed to the full number in the future, but abstractedly, <span class="accented">defect</span>, or <span class="accented">fewness</span>, as opposed to <span class="accented">fulness.</span> This interpretation agrees with the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament, viz. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>, where it seems to signify "defect," though used in that passage with a moral reference. The reason why the present <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Jews is the riches of the Gentiles is that the refusal of the Jews to accept the gospel had been the occasion of its being offered to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>; also <a href="../../par/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-9.htm">Matthew 22:9</a>). It is not, of course, meant that the gospel was not originally intended for all the world, but only that the present and immediate promulgation of it to the Gentiles had been due to the Jews' refusal. Otherwise, we may conceive, it would have been after the fulness of the Jews had come in that it would have been extended through them to the Gentiles (el. <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>).

But if thou boastest, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee</span>. In thus addressing the Gentile in the second person singular, the apostle brings his warning home to any individual Gentile Christian who might be inclined to boast; though regarding him still as representing Gentile believers generally. They are compared to slips of the wild olive tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">oleaster</span>), which was unproductive (cf.

Whether or not such a reversal of the usual system of grafting would have the imagined effect does not matter, as long as the illustration serves St. Paul's purpose well, and helps us to grasp, his conception. The common process is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"... to marry<br />A gentle scion to the wildest stock,<br />And make conceive a bark of baser kind,<br />By bud of nobler race."</span> In the illustration before us a scion of wildest stock is supposed to be made to conceive through the stock of nobler race to which it is united. The selecting the olive tree for illustration is happy, inasmuch as it was not only a characteristic produce of Palestine, but also regarded as symbolical of a plant of grace; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, "I am a green olive tree in the house of God;" also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>. See also the parable of Jotham (<a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8, 9</a>), where the trees apply first to the olive tree to be their king; and observe also there the word "fatness," used here also by St. Paul: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; (LXX.). The "branches" against which the ingrafted scion is warned not to boast are not exclusively either the broken-off or the remaining ones, but, as the sequel shows, the natural branches of the tree generally. The Gentile Christian is not to contemn the race of Israel because so large a portion of it is at present apart from the Church and under judgment; for it is, after all, from the stock of Israel, into which he has been engrafted, that he derives all his own fertility. As to the Christian Church being ever regarded as derived from that of Israel, the fulfilment and outcome of the ancient covenant, see note on Romans 1:2; and cf. <a href="../../par/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>, "For salvation is of the Jews."

Though I might not boast against the original branches that remain, and among whom I have been grafted, yet I may against those which, for their unworthiness, have been broken off to make room for me: though not boasting against the faithful Jews, I surely may against the unfaithful and rejected ones. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a></div><div class="verse">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith.

Thou art on thy trial, as they were, and alike liable to be broken off for the like cause; their present rejection should inspire in thee, not boast-fullness, but fear. The question has been raised whether St. Paul (using, as he does, the terms <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) has now the election and final salvation of individuals in view, or still only the calling to a state of salvation of races or communities of men - of the Jewish race on the one hand, and Gentile Churches on the other. The whole purport of this section of the Epistle (ch. 9, 10, 11.) seems to demand the latter view. (As to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, see on ver. 17.) Besides, if by the broken-off branches were meant simply individual unbelievers, how could we explain their being "grafted in again" (vers. 23, 24), seeing that the contemplated restoration is regarded in vers. 25, 26 as something that is to take place in the possibly distant future, after "the fulness of the Gentiles" has come in? Thus this passage is really irrelevant to any doctrines about individual election and salvation that may have been built upon it. It is, however, important as confirming the general view of Divine election not being irrespective of the conditions of human faith and perseverance.

But "with God all things are possible" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-26.htm">Matthew 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-27.htm">Mark 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-27.htm">Luke 18:27</a>). Nay - so the thought goes on - it would seem in itself more likely, and according to the nature of things, that the Jews should be brought into the Church, which is really their own, and the true fulfilment of their own oracles, than that Gentiles, who had had no similar preparation, should have been so.

St. Paul announces it as a "mystery," which his readers may be ignorant of, but which he wishes them to know. By the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as used by St. Paul, is meant something hidden from man in the Divine counsels till made known by revelation (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; and, in this Epistle, <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> - a passage which expresses clearly the apostle's meaning in his use of the word). In the LXX. it denotes any Divine secret, which may or may not be made known to man (cf. <a href="../../par/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18, 19</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a>; Wisd. 2:22; Ecclus. 22:22 Ecclus. 27:16). So also in the Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>) it is said to be given to the disciples to know the <span class="accented">mysteries</span> of the kingdom of heaven, but to others in parables. In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> were Divine secrets (as in the Eleusinian Mysteries) which were revealed to the initiated alone. St. Paul uses the word with the same essential meaning; only he speaks of <span class="accented">mysteries</span> which had already been revealed to himself and others by the Spirit, and has ever in view the Divine purposes, previously unknown, for the salvation of mankind. Thus in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; and Ephesians 3:3, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, he speaks of the Divine purpose to "gather in one all things in Christ," and that "the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs," etc., as a <span class="accented">mystery</span>, "not made known in other ages unto the sons of men," but now revealed to the "holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit." (The other passages in which St. Paul uses the word are <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>.) Here he announces the Divine purpose to save "all Israel" at last through the calling of the Gentiles as a <span class="accented">mystery</span> which has been revealed to himself and others, and which he desires the Gentile Christians to be aware of, lest they should be "wise in their own conceits," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presume on their present position of privilege through ignorance of what is in store for Israel.

Properly and usually <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> conveys a different idea from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, denoting "disobedience" or "contumacy," and not merely want of faith. But it appears to be sometimes used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. For instance, in <a href="../../par/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> is opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. Most modern commentators, with reason, understand "disobedience" here. The difference does not affect the drift of the argument),<span class="cmt_word">but now have obtained mercy through their unbelief</span> (or, <span class="accented">disobedience</span>): <span class="cmt_word">even so have these also now not believed</span> (or, <span class="accented">obeyed</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>that through your mercy</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mercy shown to you<span class="cmt_word">) they also may obtain mercy.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> has led commentators, ancient and modern, to connect <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> with the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and to try to hit upon a meaning in this connection. But the sense of the passage, as well as the parallalism of the preceding clause, favours the connection of the Authorized Version, as given above. (For a similar position of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>.)

Chrysostom and other Greek Fathers understood <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> mean only <span class="accented">declared them to be</span> unbelieving (or, <span class="accented">disobedient</span>), or <span class="accented">convicted</span> them of being so.

So, it may be said, must the verb he understood where St. Paul elsewhere uses it with a similar reference in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;</span> being there the nominative to the verb. But <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being the nominative here, the more obvious meaning seems to be that the shutting up was God's doing. Some, understanding it so, would soften the expression by explaining that God allowed them to become so shut up. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Diodorus), But we need not shrink from the plain meaning of the expression, viz. that it was God's own act. He is not thus represented as plunging men into inevitable infidelity, having given them no choice. As in the case of the <span class="accented">hardening</span> spoken of' above, his dealings are <span class="accented">judicial</span>; the state into which. they are now by him shut up has not been undeserved. And, further, his ultimate purpose is here distinctly declared to be one of mercy. The way in which the apostle regards such present judicial dealing as conducive to final mercy appears to be such as this. It is the doctrine of the whole Epistle that salvation is to be attained by man's renouncing his own imagined righteousness, and submitting himself to the righteousness of God. It conduces to this end that his <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> should have its course and consequences; so that, conscience being at length awakened, he may long for deliverance from his hopeless state, and appreciate the offered salvation (see ch. 7.). So the Gentile world was long shut up in its self-induced, but also judicial, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>); that, "the wrath of God" being at length revealed to it from heaven, the "righteousness of God" might also be revealed to it and laid hold cf. In like manner God deals now with the Jews, who still persist in going about to establish their own righteousness instead of submitting themselves to the righteousness of God. He shuts them up for the present in their <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, to the end that at length, after their long judgment, and stirred up by the fulness of the Gentiles coming in, they may feel their need, and accept salvation. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the concluding clause seems to mean generally all mankind, Jews as well as Gentiles; and <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> (as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was understood above with respect to "all Israel," as suggested by the context and the general drift of the chapter) God's embracing all races of mankind at last in the arms of his mercy by calling them into the Church. Thus the latter expression is not in itself adducible in support of the doctrine of universalism. Certainly the prospect of a universal triumph of the gospel before the end rises here before the apostle in prophetic vision; and it may be that it carries with it to his mind further glories of eternal salvation for all, casting their rays backward over all past ages, so as to inspire an unbounded hope. Such a hope, which seems elsewhere intimated (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 20-23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, would justify the glowing rhapsody of admiration and thanksgiving that follows more fully than if we supposed the apostle to contemplate still the eternal perdition of the multitudes who in all the ages have not on earth found mercy.
