and, if we have to share in his sufferings now, this only unites us the more to him, and fits us the more for our inheritance of eternal life with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:18 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - For what of all these present sufferings, these present drawbacks to the full triumph of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in you, these present evidences that the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> still clings to you?

In short, his having preordained us to our present state of salvation carries with it his preordaining us also to its end and purpose, which is glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:31-34 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-34.</span> - If God be thus for us, who can be against us?

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free</span> (not <span class="accented">hath made me</span>; the aorist refers to the time when the Christian became possessed of the Spirit of life in Christ) from the law of sin and death. Here is a distinct contrast to the state described in vers. 14, 23 of ch. 7, and a realization of what was yearned for in ver. 24, "the law of sin and of death" being evidently "the law of sin in the members" previously spoken cf. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, before in captivity to this law, is now freed from it. And how? Not by its becoming a different <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>; not by a change of the constituent elements of human nature; but by the introduction of a new law - the law of the Spirit of life - which has emancipated the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> from its old unwelcome thraldom. In virtue of this new law, introduced into my being, I am now free to give my entire allegiance to the law of God. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, be it observed, is here again used in a sense different from its usual one, and we thus have a still further <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in addition to those defined in the note after <a href="../../par/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>. The designation of this new law is in marked opposition to that in which the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> was before said to be held; we have <span class="accented">life</span> in opposition to <span class="accented">death</span>, and the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> in opposition to the <span class="accented">flesh</span>, as well as <span class="accented">freedom</span> in opposition to <span class="accented">captivity.</span> The <span class="accented">Spirit</span> is, in fact, the Divine Spirit, taking possession of what is <span class="accented">spiritual</span> (now at length brought into view) in the <span class="accented">inward man</span>, making him partaker in the Divine <span class="accented">life</span>, and able to serve God <span class="accented">freely.</span> The expressions used bring out strikingly one essential distinction between Law and Gospel, viz. that the principle of the former is to control and discipline conduct by requirements and threats; but of the latter to introduce into man's inner being a new principle of life, whence right conduct may spontaneously flow. Coercion is the principle of the one; inspiration of the other. An illustration may be found in the treatment of disease - on the one hand by attempted repression of specific ailments, and on the other by imparting a new vitality to the system, which may of itself dispel disease. It is shown next how this new state of freedom has been brought about. First, by what God in Christ has done for us apart from ourselves; the subjective condition in ourselves being introduced at the end of ver. 4, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what the Law could not do</span> (this is certainly what is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</span> The Law could not deliver from the domination of sin; it was weak for such a purpose (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18, 19</a>) but this not through any defect in itself but as having to work through our sinful flesh which refused obedience. And it was not the office of law to regenerate; it could only command and threaten. Hence the deliverance came, and could only come, from God himself (and this in accordance with the grand idea of the whole Epistle, expressed by the phrase, "the righteousness of God"); and so he sent <span class="accented">his own</span> Son (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his Son essentially - in a sense in which none of us can be called sons, himself Divine. The whole drift of the passage, as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, requires this conception); and he sent him into the very sphere of things that required redemption, that by actual participation in it he might personally redeem it; for he sent him in likeness of our "flesh of sin." It is not said <span class="accented">in flesh of sin</span>; for that might imply sin in Christ's individual humanity: but, on the other hand, "in likeness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) does not imply docetism, as though Christ's humanity were not real; for stress is evidently laid on the fact that it was in our actual human flesh that he "condemned" sin. The phrase appears to mean the same as what is expressed in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-17.htm">Hebrews 2:17</a> and Hebrews 4:15: <span class="greek">&#x1f6c;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>.

Both this and the preceding expression are most naturally and intelligibly connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; not, as some say, with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> comes suitably after the former verb, as denoting the occasion and purpose of the sending (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/5-14.htm">Luke 5:14</a>). In <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-8.htm">Hebrews 10:8</a> (quoting from <a href="../../par/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> in the LXX.) we find <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, where the expression signifies offerings for sin; and in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. The correspondence of phrase here suggests decidedly the idea of the purpose of <span class="accented">atonement</span> being intended to be expressed by it, though it does not follow that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is used here substantively as it seems to be in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-8.htm">Hebrews 10:8</a>. But in what sense are we to understand <span class="accented">condemned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>) sin? We observe first that the verb appears to be suggested by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 1, the connection being that formerly sin condemned us, but now sin itself has been condemned; that is (as Meyer expresses it), deposed from its rule in the flesh - "jure sue dejectum" (Calvin). (Perhaps similarly, <a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.) One view of the force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span> (found in Origen, and taken by Erasmus and others), that it denotes the <span class="accented">punishment</span> of sin endured by Christ vicariously on the cross, is not only not obvious, but inconsistent also with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> preceding; for what the Law could not do, was not to punish sin, but to deliver from it. Nor is there, further, anything in the language used to confine the condemnation of sin, in whatever sense intended, to the atonement made for it on the cross itself. It was in the whole mission of the Saviour (expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) that sin was "condemned;" and the idea may include his triumph over it in his human life no less than the penalty paid for it on the cross in behalf of man. "In the flesh" (connected with <span class="accented">condemned</span>, not with <span class="accented">sin</span>) does not mean Christ's own flesh, but human nature generally. He represented man, having become for our sake the Soul of man; and we share his triumph over <span class="accented">sin</span>, made in our very human flesh, when we are baptized into his death, and become thereupon partakers of his resurrection. This idea, ever present to St. Paul's mind, is expressed in the next verse, where our own appropriation of the condemnation of sin in Christ is declared.

This, then, is the purpose of Christ's victory over sin - that the requirement of the Law in us too may be fulfilled; which evidently means more -than that his victory may be <span class="accented">imputed to</span> us, on the ground of our faith only, while we remain as we were. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, and also the condition appended at the end of the verse, imply that the "Spirit of life" must so dominate over the flesh in ourselves that the Law may forfeit its claims over us. The sinful propensions of the flesh remain in us still (as the verses that follow distinctly show); but the Spirit that is in us is strong enough to overcome them now (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-18</a>). It does not follow from this that any Christians will actually avoid all sin, or that they can be accepted <span class="accented">on the</span> <span class="accented">ground of</span> their own performance: to say this would be to contradict other Scripture (cf. <a href="../../par/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>); and Paul confessed himself to be not already perfected (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>). But perfection, through Christ who lives in them, is put before us as, at any rate, the aim of the regenerate (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>); and by actual and progressive holiness they are to show that their union with Christ is real. His Spirit within them must, at any rate, give a new direction and tone to their characters and lives.

Observe, too, how persistently and continually the apostle presses his protest against antinomian abuse of the doctrine of grace, with which he began this section of his Epistle, at ch. 6:1, He never loses sight of it; it pervades the whole. If St. Paul, especially in this Epistle, is, on the one hand, the great exponent of the doctrine of justification by faith only, he is, on the other, no less the persistent preacher of the necessity of works. Sanctification is continually pressed as the necessary result, as well as evidence, of justification. He only shuts out human works from the office of justifying.

These verses have been variously understood. It has been supposed by some that ver. 10 continues the thought of ver. 9; "the body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) meaning the same as "the flesh (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>),and dead (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) meaning <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. mortified</span>, or lifeless with respect to the power of sin that was in it (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Thus the meaning of the first clause of ver. 10 would be, "If Christ be in you, the body of sin in you is dead; but you are alive in the Spirit." Decisive objections to this view are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by itself is not elsewhere used as an equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, but as denoting our mere <span class="accented">bodily</span> organization. This statement is consistent with the metaphorical application of the word sometimes in a different verse, as in <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, above quoted, and in <a href="../../par/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>. Observe also <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11, which can hardly be taken but as expressing what is intended here; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) cannot be forced out of its proper meaning of "<span class="accented">because</span> of," which, according to the view we are considering, would be unintelligible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that ver. 11, which is obviously connected in thought with ver. 10, cannot well be brought into tune with it according to the view proposed. All is made clear, in view both of language and of context, by taking these two verses as introducing a new thought, which is carried out afterwards in ver. 18, viz. that of the drawback to the full enjoyment and development of our spiritual life owing to the mortal bodies which clothe us now and the purpose is to bid us believe in the reality of our redemption, and persevere in correspondent life, notwithstanding such present drawback. Thus the idea is that, though in our present earthly state the mortal body is death-stricken in consequence of sin (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - subject to the doom of Adam, that extended to all his race (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, etc.) - yet, Christ being in us now, the same Divine Spirit that raised him from the dead will in us too at last overcome mortality. cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the same word as in ver. 11 here); and compare also all that follows in that chapter. This view of the meaning of the passage before us is strongly confirmed by our finding, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-5:6</a>, exactly the same idea carried out at length, with a correspondence also of the language used. The frail, mortal, ever-dying earthen vessels, in which we have now the treasure of our life in Christ, are there regarded as crippling the expansion of our spiritual life, and causing us to "groan, being burdened" (cf. in the chapter before us, ver. 23, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); but the very consciousness of this higher life within him, yearning so for an adequate and deathless organism, assures the apostle that God has one in store for him, having already given him "the earnest of the Spirit." And this seems to be what is meant hereby "shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." As to particular expressions in the verses before us, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, applied to "the <span class="accented">body</span>," may be taken to mean <span class="accented">infected with death, and doomed to it</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a> - <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, given as the reason for the Spirit being life, may be explained with reference to the essential conception of <span class="accented">righteousness</span> throughout the Epistle, as God's <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, revealed in Christ, and made over to man as the remedy of human sin. Before carrying out the thought peculiarly suggested by the last two verses (as is done at ver. 18), the apostle now draws a conclusion (expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) from what has been so far said, so as to press the more the obligation of a spiritual <span class="accented">life</span> in Christians.

True, the "deeds" spoken of are, in fact, those of <span class="accented">the flesh</span>; but the body is regarded as the organ of the lusts of the flesh, and it is fitly named here in connection with the thought of the preceding verses. The word translated. "deeds" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, denoting, not single acts, but rather <span class="accented">doings -</span> the general outcome in action of fleshly lusts using the body as their organ. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, viewed in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 11, seem to point ultimately to the result hereafter of the two courses of life denoted: but not, it would seem, exclusively; for our future state is constantly regarded by the apostle as the continuance and sequence of what is begun in us already - whether of life in Christ now unto life eternal, or of death in sin now unto death beyond the grave. The general idea may be stated thus: If ye live after the flesh, the power in you to which you give your allegiance and adhesion will involve you in its own doom, death; but if ye live after the Spirit, you identify yourselves with the Spirit of life that is in you, whereby you will be emancipated at last even from these your mortal bodies, whose doings you already slay.

For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the Spirit of adoption, wherein we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him</span>. In ver. 14 is introduced a further ground for the assertion in ver. 13, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>; viz. the felt <span class="accented">sonship</span> to God of those who have so received his Spirit as <span class="accented">t</span>o be <span class="accented">led</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> practically actuated) by it. We say "felt" because, though in this verse the sonship is alleged as a fact, yet, in the following verses (15,16) the inward experience of true Christians is appealed to as evidence of such sonship. Then, in ver. 17, the thought is carried out, that <span class="accented">sonship</span> implies <span class="accented">inheritance</span>, and hence a share in the glorified eternal life of Christ. (This conclusion makes further evident what was meant to be implied above in the expression <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>.) "When, after your conversion," the apostle would say, "ye received the Spirit, it did not inspire you with the fear of slaves, but with filial love and trust. And this you know also is the feeling that we give vent to in the congregation, when we cry out [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, denoting emotional utterance], Abba, Father." This last expression is given by St. Mark as our Lord's own in the garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:36). We may conclude that the Aramaic word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1fb6;</span> was the one used by him, and heard by St. Peter, who is said to have been St. Mark's informant in the composition of his Gospel; the equivalent Greek word, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, having been added originally by the evangelist in explanation (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a> and Mark 7:34 for similar instances of St. Mark giving Christ's own expressions, with their Greek equivalents). Afterwards it may be further supposed that the Greek-speaking Christians came to use the whole phrase, as it had been delivered to them, in their own devotions, as representing our Lord's own mode of addressing the Father, and so as expressing peculiarly their union with Christ, and their filial relation to God in him. It is probable also, from the way St. Paul here introduces the expression (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, changing from the second to the first person plural), that it was in customary use, perhaps at some special parts of the service, in congregational worship. It occurs once more in a passage closely corresponding with the one before us, and which should be studied in connection with it (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). It is to be observed how, in ver. 17, the idea of our sonship now, and consequently of our being <span class="accented">joint-heirs</span> with Christ, leads up to a resumption of the now prevailing thought of our present condition in the mortal body being no bar to our final inheritance of life. It is our being as yet in these mortal bodies that is the cause of our present suffering; but he also was in the body, and he also so suffered; and our sharing in his sufferings really unites us the more to him, and the more ensures our final inheritance with him (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The apostle introduces next a deep and suggestive view, both in explanation of our now being subject to suffering, and in confirmation of our expectation of future glory notwithstanding. He points to nature generally, to God's whole creation, so far as it is under our view in this mundane sphere, as being at present "subject to vanity," and, as it were, groaning under some power of evil, which is at variance with our ideal of what it should be, and from which there is a general and instinctive yearning for deliverance. Our present sufferings - all those drawbacks to the full enjoyment of our spiritual life - are due to our being at present in the body, and so forming part of the present system of things. But that general yearning is in itself significant of a deliverance; and so the sympathetic witness of nature confirms the hope of our higher spiritual yearnings, and encourages us to endure and wait. Such is the general drift of the passage, continued to the end of ver. 25. Particular thoughts and expressions will be noticed in the course of it.

And so here, except so far as the context limits it; for see especially <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 22. It is, indeed, apparently so limited to the part of creation of which we have cognizance at present; for see <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 22, which denotes a known fact. But is there any further limitation, as many commentators contend? Putting aside as untenable, in view of the whole context (see especially ver. 23), the view of those who understand the new spiritual creation of the regenerate to be meant, we may remark as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> includes certainly all <span class="accented">mankind</span>, not excepting the regenerate. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> in ver. 23 means that "we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit" are included, not that we are a class apart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">whole</span> <span class="accented">animal creation</span> is included too. So general a term as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> could not surely have been used if man only had been meant. And it is obviously true that the whole sentient creation, as well as man, has a share now in the general suffering. To the objection that the irrational creatures cannot be conceived as sharing in the "hope" and "earnest expectation" spoken of, it may be replied that, so far as it seems to be implied that they do, it may only be that the apostle, by a fine <span class="accented">prosopopeia</span>, conceives them as feeling even as the human mind feels concerning them. But, further, conscious hope and expectation does not seem, if the language of the passage be examined, to be distinctly attributed to them. All that is of necessity implied is that they share in the groaning from which we crave deliverance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Inanimate nature too <span class="accented">may be</span> included in the idea, it also seeming to share in the present mystery of evil, and falling short of our ideal of a terrestrial paradise. Tholuck appositely quotes Philo as saying that all nature <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. It may be that St. Paul had in his mind what is said in Genesis of the cursing of the ground for man's sake, and of the thorns and thistles; and also the pictures found in the prophets of a renovated earth, in which the desert should rejoice and blossom as the rose. Calvin comments on the whole passage thus: "Omissa expesitionum varietate, hunc locum accipio, nullum esse elementum, nullamque mundi pattern, quae non, veluti praesontis miseriae agnitione tacta, in spem resurrectionis intenta sit." Again, "Spem creaturis quae sensu carent ideo tribuit, ut fideles oculos aperiant ad conspectum invisibilis vitae, quamvis adhuc sub deformi habitu lateat."

Thus the assertions of <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>: and 31, stand unshaken, viz. that in the beginning God created all things, and that all at first was "very good." The ideas, resorted to in order to account for existing evil, of matter (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>) being essentially evil, and of a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, other than the Supreme God, having made the world, are alike precluded.

All that is, or could be, said is that it was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, meaning God. It was his will that it should be so; this is all we know; except that we find the beginning of evil, so far as it affects man, attributed in Scripture to human sin. But he so subjected his creation <span class="accented">in hope.</span> This expression may refer to the <span class="accented">protoevangelium</span> of <a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, or to the never-dying hope in the human heart; to either or to both. The latter idea is expressed in the myth of Pandora's box. Further, the creature is said to have been so subjected "not willingly" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). No sentient beings acquiesce in suffering; they resent evil, and would fain flee from it. Man especially unwillingly submits to his present bondage. When in ver. 21 the hope is expressed of the creature (or creation) itself being eventually freed from the present bondage of corruption, it may be that the human part of creation only is in the writer's eye; but it may be also (there being still no expressed limitation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) that he conceives a final emancipation of the whole creation from evil (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). But if so, it is not said that the peculiar glory of the sons of God will extend to all creation, but only that all will be freed into the freedom of their glory; which may mean that the day of the revelation of the sons of God in glory will bring with it a general emancipation of all creation from its present bondage. Such a great final hope finds expression in the verse - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"That God, which ever lives and loves,<br />One God, one law, one element,<br />And one far-off Divine event,<br />To which the whole creation moves."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">In Memoriam.'</span>) The present condition of things is in ver. 20 denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and in ver. 21 by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. The first of these words is the equivalent in the LXX. of the Hebrew XXX, which means properly "breath," or "vapour," and is used metaphorically for anything frail, fruitless, evanescent, vain. It is often applied to idols, and it is the word in Ecclesiastes where it is said that "all is vanity" (cf. also <a href="../../par/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5, 6</a>). It seems here to denote the frailty, incompleteness, transitoriness, to which all things are now subject.

The present unwilling subjection of the whole visible creation to evil is here still more forcibly expressed, and spoken of as being what is known - a subject of experience to all who observe and think; and it is added that this state of things continues still - it is "until now." The yearned-for deliverance has not yet come; and therefore we should not be surprised if we too, the regenerate, while in the body, are not yet exempt from our share in the universal groaning. For we have but the <span class="accented">first fruits</span> of the Spirit as yet, not its full triumph; cf. "the <span class="accented">earnest</span> of the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>), and "the <span class="accented">earnest</span> of our inheritance " (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>). Its being said that we still wait for our adoption as sons is not inconsistent with other statements (as in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5-7</a>, and above, ver. 14, etc.), to the effect that we are already adopted, and are already sons; for <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here denotes the final realization of our present sonship, when the sons of' God shall be <span class="accented">revealed</span> (ver. 19).

In one sense we are redeemed already; in another we await our redemption, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the full accomplishment thereof.

The meaning is that when the state of salvation was entered upon, hope was an essential element in its appropriation. A condition, not of attainment, but of hope, is therefore the normal condition of the regenerate now; and so, after shortly pointing out the very meaning of hope, the apostle enforces his previous conclusion, that they must be content at present to wait with patience. <span class="cmt_word">But hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it</span>. Now comes in a further thought, and a very interesting one.

Here, then, is a further source of help and comfort to Christians under present trials. Of themselves they know not what relief to crave. St. Paul himself knew not what to pray for as he ought, when he asked for removal of his thorn in the flesh; if left to themselves, their long waiting and their manifold perplexities might damp their hope; but a Helper beyond themselves comes in to succour them, viz. the Holy Spirit himself, who intercedes (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) for them. But how? Not as the Son intercedes for them, apart from themselves, at the mercy-seat; but within themselves, by inspiring them with these unutterable (or, <span class="accented">unuttered</span>) groanings; and they are conscious that such deep and intense yearnings are from the Divine Spirit moving them, and teaching them to pray. They may not still be able to put their requests of God into definite form, or even express them in words; but they know that God knows the meaning of what his own Spirit has inspired. This is a deep and pregnant thought. Even apart from the peculiar faith and inspiration of the gospel, the internal consciousness of the human soul, with its yearnings after something as yet unrealized, affords one of the most cogent evidences of a life to come to those who feel such yearnings. For ideals seem to postulate corresponding realities; instinctive longings seem to postulate fulfilment. Else were human nature a strange riddle indeed. But Christian faith vivifies the ideal, and intensifies the longing; and thus the prophecy of internal consciousness acquires a new force to the Christian believer; and this all the more from his being convinced that the quickening of spiritual life of which he is conscious is Divine. The psalmist of old, when he sang, "As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God," felt in these ardent though inarticulate pantings a presage of fulfilment of his "hope in God." So the devout Christian; and all the more in proportion to the intenseness and definiteness of his yearnings, and his conviction that they are from God.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a></div><div class="verse">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate <i>to be</i> conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. And whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified</span>. Thus is introduced the doctrine of predestination. This is indeed a principal passage on which theological theories with regard to it have been built. It, with the context, is the basis of the definition of predestination in Art. 17. It is, therefore, of great importance to consider carefully what the apostle here really says, and appears most obviously to mean; it being the duty of the expositor to pay regard to this only, in view of the language used, the way it is introduced, and any cognate passages that may throw light upon it. We may observe, in the first place, that it is plain that more is spoken of here than <span class="accented">national</span> election, or predestination to a state of privilege, which is the subject especially treated in ch. 9. <span class="accented">Individual</span> predestination is in view; and this not to gospel privileges only, but also carrying with it the result of glory. But it still remains to be seen whether such predestination is regarded as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">absolute, i.e.</span> irrespective, with regard to its final result, of the <span class="accented">condition</span> of man's use of grace given; and, if so, whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">arbitrary, i.e.</span> irrespective of the Divine foreknowledge of what men would be, and themselves deserve. The Calvinistic view is that God from all eternity, of the mere good pleasure of his will, selected certain persons out of mankind to be the heirs of glory; the Arminian is that he foresaw from all eternity who would, in the exercise of their own free-will, respond to his purpose, and, in virtue of such foreknowledge, preordained them to glory. It is hardly necessary to consider whether there is any countenance given to the view that predestination ensures salvation, however a man may live; the obligation of actual holiness in Christians being (as we have seen) so strongly insisted on all along. If, then, the Calvinistic theory should appear to be supported, it must be with the proviso that predestination of necessity carries with it the grace of <span class="accented">perseverance</span> in good works, or at any rate a true conversion before the end, as well as final glory. Let us, in the first place, observe the way in which St. Paul introduces the subject, so as better to understand his drift. He has been speaking of the trials and imperfections of the present life, and urging his readers not to be discouraged by them, on the ground that, if they continue to "live after the Spirit," these things will by no means hinder, but rather further, the final issue. To strengthen this position he introduces the thought of God's eternal purpose; in effect thus: Your being in the state of grace in which you now feel yourselves to be, is due to God's eternal purpose to call you to this state, and thus in the end to save you. It is impossible that the circumstances in which he places you now, or any power whatever, should thwart God's eternal purpose. But it is not of necessity implied by anything that is actually said that the persons addressed might not themselves resist the Divine purpose. In fact, their own perseverance appears to be presupposed already, and they have been urged to it all along, as though their use of grace depended on themselves. Hence the apostle in this passage does not really touch the theoretic questions that have been raised by theologians, his purpose being simply the practical one of encouraging his readers to persevere and hope. We may now examine the successive expressions in the passage, and see what they imply. In ver. 28 the context shows <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> to have especial reference to external circumstances of trial, and not at all to men's own sins. Calvin, commenting on it, quotes St. Augustine as saying, "Peceata quoque sua, ordinante Dei providentia, sanctis ideo non nocere ut potius corum saluti inserviant;" but while he assents to this proposition, he denies, with truth, that any such meaning is intended here. It may be observed, in passing, that Augustine's proposition, though it sounds strange, may, in a certain sense, be accepted as true: "We must continually err in order to be humble; our frailty and sins are the tools that God uses" (General Gordon's 'Letters to his Sister,' p. 371). Further, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> cannot be understood as limiting <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, as though among those that love God only some are "the called;" nor can <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> be understood as limiting <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, as though even of the called not all are called with the purpose of saving them. Only a preconceived idea could surely have suggested such an interpretation of the verse. In ver. 29 (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> bearing the sense of "to determine," as well as of "to know") <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> may possibly mean "predetermined" rather than "foreknew." Elsewhere in the New Testament, when used of men, it has the latter sense (<a href="../../par/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>). When used of God, it may, as here, have either meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>); but in the text last referred to the first meaning seems more probable. So also of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>. The distinction would not be of much importance but for the fact that the sense of "foreknew" has been pressed in support of the Arminian view; viz. that Divine predestination was consequent on the Divine foreknowledge of what men would be. It would not, indeed, really prove this view, since it might only mean that God knew beforehand the objects of his intended mercy. Calvin, though translating <span class="accented">praecognovit</span>, strongly rebuts the Arminian inference, saying, "Insulsi colligunt illi, quos dixi, Deum non alios elegisse nisi quos sua gratia dignos fore praevidit." Again, "Sequitur notitiam hanc a bene placito pendere, quia Deus nihil extra seipsum praeseivit quos voluit adoptando, sod tantum signavit quos eligere volebat.' <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (which might, perhaps, be better rendered <span class="accented">preordained</span>, which is its proper meaning, so as to avoid the necessary idea of irresistible destiny which is commonly associated with the word <span class="accented">predestinate</span>) must be taken, not absolutely, but in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. That the elect should in the first place be "conformed to the image of Christ" is all that is, here at least, denoted as preordained by God. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>, may be understood, from the preceding context, to refer, primarily at least, to participation in Christ's sufferings (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Coming to ver. 30, we find the following sequence: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> eternal foreknowledge (or eternal purpose), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> preordination to fellowship with Christ, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> calling (to acceptance of the gospel), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> justification, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> glorification.  <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (4) means the participation in God's <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, the passing into a "state of salvation" through faith in baptism. But what is meant by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (5) has been a subject of discussion. Some, in view of the aorist, not future, tense of the verb, understand it of <span class="accented">sanctification</span> subsequent to <span class="accented">justification</span>, regarded as participation in the <span class="accented">glory</span> of the Divine holiness. Others, in view of the significance of the word itself, understand future glory, the aorist being accounted, for by the apostle's taking in one view the whole process of salvation with its final result, which is contemplated as accomplished. Perhaps both ideas are included, present sanctification being regarded as the commencement and earnest of the full glory to be revealed in "the sons of God" hereafter. In any case, we are not bound by what is here said to conclude that final glory of necessity follows the previous stages. For the apostle may be only setting forth the process and result when grace is not resisted. But certainly he implies that, when the result is glory, all is to be traced, not to man's initiation or deservings, but to Divine grace, and the Divine purpose of mercy from eternity. In the remainder of this chapter the apostle rises into a strain of glowing eloquence, into a very song of triumph, in view of the assured hope of faithful Christians. Faithfulness, be it once more observed, is presupposed throughout the passage, which is quite wrongly understood as encouraging confidence in any on the ground of their conviction that they are certainly, even in spite of themselves, predestinated to glory: it only encourages perseverance in spite of trial on the ground of our feeling that, if we do persevere, we cannot fail, because God is on our side, and it is his eternal purpose to save us.

Many may be <span class="accented">called</span> to a state of salvation, but not all of them <span class="accented">chosen</span> finally, as fulfilling the purpose of their calling.) It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. A different punctuation of these two verses is preferred by some, and seems more natural and more forcible; thus: Who <span class="accented">shall charge God's elect? God who justifieth? Who is he that condemneth? Christ who died?</span> etc. A similar answering a question by asking another is found below in ver. 35. The further thought is thus implied that, if neither God charges, nor Christ, the Judge, condemns, who can do either? The apostle next goes on to say that, there being none to charge and condemn us at last, so also there is none that can <span class="accented">remove</span> us from our state of acceptance now. For who or what can possibly prove stronger than Christ's love, which has called us to it? The enumeration that follows of things that might possibly be supposed to remove us shows again that it is not our own sins, but external circumstances of trial, that are being viewed all along as powerless to hinder our salvation.

Enough to say that what is meant is, that nothing whatever, in heaven or earth, or under the earth, can thwart God's good purpose for us, or separate us from his love. The following paraphrastic summary of this important chapter, free from the encumbrance of notes, may help to a clearer perception of its drift and sequence of thought: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Divine omnipotence combined with omniscience on the one hand, and human free-will on the other, seem indeed to human reason to be incompatible ideas; yet we are compelled to entertain both - the one on the ground, not only of scriptural teaching, but also of our conception of the Divine Being; the other on the ground, not only of our conception of Divine justice, but also of our own irresistible consciousness, and of scriptural teaching too. Such difficulty of reconciliation between two apparently necessary ideas is not peculiar to theology; philosophy has it too; and there are necessitarians among philosophers, as well as predestinarians among theologians, equally contradicting man's irresistible consciousness of having the power of choice. We can only regard the conflicting conceptions as partial apprehensions of a great truth which as a whole is beyond us. The apparent contradiction between them may be due to the failure of finite beings to comprehend infinity. They have been compared to two parallel straight lines, which, according to geometrical definition, can never meet, and yet, according to the higher mathematical theory, meet in infinity; or we may take the illustration of an asymptote, which from a finite point of view can never possibly touch a curve, and yet, in analytical geometry, is found to cross it at an infinite distance. For the practical purposes of life both ideas may be entertained; and it is only human attempts to reconcile them in theory, or to escape the difficulty by denying free-will altogether, that have given rise to the endless controversies on the subject. It is important to observe how St. Paul, though he distinctly intimates both conceptions (as he must needs do as a preacher of God's truth in all its aspects), and though his allusions to predestination have been made a main support of Calvinistic views, never really propounds a theory. When he alludes to the subject, it is with a practical purpose; and when (as in this chapter) he speaks of God's predestination of believers to glory, his purpose is to encourage them to persevere in holiness on the ground of their assurance of God's eternal purpose concerning them, the essential human conditions being all along supposed to be fulfilled (see also note on Hebrews 6:16-20, in 'Pulpit Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
