For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - From admonitions to keep peace, if possible, with all men, whether or not within the Christian circle, and to act honourably and benevolently towards all, the apostle now passes to <span class="accented">the duty of Christians towards the civil government and the laws of the country in which they lived.</span> It is well known that the Jews were impatient of the Roman dominion, and that some held it to be unlawful, on religious grounds, to pay tribute to Caesar (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17</a>). Insurrections against the government had consequently been frequent. There had been the notable one under Judas the Gaulonite of Gamala (called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>), who left followers behind him, called Gaulonites, and to whose tenets Josephus attributes all subsequent insurrections of the Jews ('Ant.,' 18:01. &sect; 1). Recently one had broken out in Rome, which had caused Claudius to order the expulsion of all Jews from the city (<a href="../../par/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; cf. Suetonius, 'Claud.,' 25; Din Cassius, 60:6). The Christians, being regarded as a Jewish sect, and known for their acknowledgment of a Messiah and their refusal to comply with heathen usages, were not unnaturally confounded with such disturbers of the peace (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-37.htm">Acts 21:37</a>). It was, therefore, peculiarly needful that the Christian communities should be cautioned to disprove such accusations by showing themselves in all respects good, law-abiding subjects. They might easily be under a temptation to be otherwise. Feeling themselves already subjects of Christ's new kingdom, and regarding the second advent as probably near at hand, they might seem to themselves above the powers and institutions of the unbelieving world, which were so soon to pass away. St. Paul himself condemned resort to heathen tribunals in matters which Christians might settle among themselves (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>, etc.); and many might go so far as to ignore the authority of such tribunals over the saints at all. Peter and John had at the first defied the authority even of the Sanhedrin in matters touching conscience (<a href="../../par/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>); and many might be slow to distinguish between temporal and spiritual spheres of jurisdiction. St. Paul, therefore, lays down the rule that the civil government, in whatsoever hands it might be, was, no less than the Church, a Divine institution for the maintenance of order in the world, to be submitted to and obeyed by Christians within the whole sphere of its legitimate authority. He does not refer to cases in which it might become necessary to obey God rather than man: his purpose here does not call on him to do so; nor were the circumstances so far such as to bring such cases into prominence; for he was writing in the earlier part of Nero's reign, before any general persecution of Christians had begun. Nor does he touch on the question whether it may be right in some cases for subjects to resist usurped power or tyranny, or to take part in political revolutions, and even fight for freedom. Such a question was apart from his subject, which is the general duty of obedience to the law and government under which we are placed by Providence. This is the only passage in which he treats the subject at length and definitely. In a doctrinal and practical treatise like this Epistle, addressed as an <span class="accented">apologia pro fide sua</span> to the metropolis of the world and the seat of government, it was fitting that he should express clearly the attitude of the Church with regard to the civil order. But his teaching in other Epistles is in accordance with this; as where (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>) he bids slaves acquiesce in the existing law of slavery, and (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, etc.) he desires especially prayers to be made in behalf of kings and rulers. And he himself notably carried out his principles in this regard (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/23-5.htm">Acts 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/25-8.htm">Acts 25:8-11</a>). There is a closely similar passage in the First Epistle of St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12-18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of</span> (rather, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God: the powers that be are ordained of God</span>. It is of God's ordering that there should be human governments and human laws. Without them there could be no order, security, or progress among mankind. Imperfect as they may often be, and in some instances oppressive and unjust, still they exist for a purpose of good, and form part of the Divine order for the government of the world. In this sense all are from God, and ordained of God; and in submitting to them we are submitting to God.

Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same</span>. It is the theory of the laws of all civilized governments to uphold justice, and only to punish what is wrong; and in the main they do so. The principles of the Roman law were just, and Paul himself found protection from its officers and tribunals, whose fairness he had, and had reason to have, more confidence in than in the tender mercy of either Gentile or Jewish zealots (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 21:31, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 22:30; 24:10; 25:10, 11; 26:30, <span class="accented">seq.</span>).

But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain</span> (though "the sword" might possibly be understood as only the familiar symbol of power, yet the mention of it may be taken to imply the apostle's recognition of the legitimacy of capital punishment, such as he also expressed distinctly, <a href="../../par/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>): <span class="cmt_word">for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</span> <span class="accented">Wrath</span> here expresses the familiar idea of the Divine wrath against evil-doing, for the execution of which, in the sphere of human law, the magistrate is the appointed instrument (see note on Romans 12:19). <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake</span>.

So in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ideo enim et tributa praestatis.</span> The Christians, we may suppose, did pay all legal dues and taxes; it was a recognized principle that they were bound to do so; perhaps because of Christ himself having settled the question in his dictum about the tribute-money (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>). And what the apostle means may be that the same principle on which they paid their taxes extended to all legal requirements) <span class="cmt_word">tribute also: for they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the officers who exact tribute) <span class="cmt_word">are</span> <span class="cmt_word">God's ministers</span> (not, as in ver. 4, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>. This word, with its correlatives, is used in the New Testament especially with reference to the ceremonial services of the temple, and to their counterpart in Christian devotion; but not exclusively so (see <a href="../../par/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>). In classical Greek it denotes peculiarly persons performing public duties, or works of public use. This well-known use of the word may have suggested it here, the apostle meaning to say that such as in any such way served the state were in fact serving God), <span class="cmt_word">attending continually upon this very thing</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> for God.

The idea of the passage is but a carrying out of our Lord's saying, <a href="../../par/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39, 40</a>. We find it also in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-14.htm">Galatians 5:14</a> more shortly expressed. <span class="cmt_word">For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended</span> (or, <span class="accented">summed up</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

There can be little, if any, doubt that the apostle had in view the second coming of Christ, which he with others supposed might be close at hand, Our Lord had said that of that day none knew but the Father (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and that it would come unexpectedly (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27, 37-44</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-36.htm">Mark 13:36</a>). Further, in the same addresses to the disciples before his death in which these things were said, he seems to have disclosed a vista of the future, after the manner of the ancient prophets, in which more immediate and more distant fulfilments of the prophetic vision were not clearly distinguished; so that words which we now perceive to have pointed to the destruction of Jerusalem, which was typical of the final judgments, might easily have been understood as referring to the latter. Such are, "This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled" (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-30.htm">Mark 13:30</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/john/21-22.htm">John 21:22, 23</a>). Hence it was natural that the apostolic Church should regard the second advent as probably imminent. We find in the apostolic Epistles several intimations of this expectation (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2-5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>); and though it was not realized in the event, the authority of the apostles as inspired teachers is not thus disparaged, this being the very thing which Christ had said must remain unknown to all. Nor does their teaching, enforced by this expectation, lose its force to us; for, though "the Lord delayeth his coming," and may still delay it, yet to each of us at least this present world is fast passing away, and the Lord may be close at hand to call us out of it. The duty of watchfulness and preparedness remains unchanged. The <span class="accented">Parousia</span> or, as it is called in the pastoral Epistles, the <span class="accented">Epiphany</span> (in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) of Christ is here, as elsewhere, presented under the figure of the day appearing (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>; l Thessalonians 5:4; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>), the previous ages of the world being regarded as the time of night.
