The position to be proved is that all mankind is guilty before God (see note on ver. 18). So far this has been shown with regard to the mass of the heathen world; its general moral corruption, prevalent and condoned, having been pointed out finally as a glaring proof; the main point of the argument having been to trace this state of things to man's own fault, in that he had refused to retain and act on a knowledge of God originally imparted to him through nature and through conscience. From such refusal had ensued idolatry; thence, as a judicial consequence, profligacy; thence a general prevalence of abominable practices; and at last (in many at least) the "reprobate mind," lost to moral restraint, and approving of vice as well as practising it. Thus it is sufficiently proved that the heathen world, regarded as a whole, is under sin, and liable to the wrath of God. But the required proof that the whole of mankind is guilty is not yet complete. It might be said that there are many still who disapprove of all this wickedness, and sit in judgment on it, and who are, therefore, not themselves implicated in the guilt. To such persons the apostle now turns, his purpose being to show that their judging others does not exempt themselves, unless they can show that they are themselves sinless. All, he argues, are tainted with sin, and therefore implicated in the guilt of the human race, while the very fact of their judging others condemns them all the more. It is usually said by commentators that, the sin of the heathen world having been established in the first chapter, the second has reference exclusively to the Jews. But this is surely not so. The expressions, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (vers. 1, 3), seem evidently to include <span class="accented">all</span> who judge others; and it is not till ver. 9 that any distinction between Jew and Gentile comes in. Nor would the argument have been complete without refutation of Gentile as well as Jewish judgers of others. For the philosophical schools especially claimed superiority to the mass of mankind, and would be likely to resent their own inclusion in the general condemnation. Notably the Stoics, whose philosophy was at that time, as well as that of the Epicureans, extensively professed by educated Romans. Seneca was a contemporary of St. Paul. The Stoics might be suitably designated as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: for they affected to look down from a position of calm philosophical superiority on those who followed their mere natural impulses, professing to be themselves guided by right reason, and superior to the passions of ordinary humanity. It was a home-thrust at them to ask - Are you, who thus judge others, as exempt as you profess to be from the vices you condemn? If the accounts that have come down to us of Seneca's own life be true, he certainly was not a paragon of virtue. Now, be it observed that the sort of people now addressed are not concluded to be sunk into all the depths of sin spoken of above; their very affecting to judge others implies, at any rate, theoretic approval of the right. Nor does St. Paul anywhere suggest that there is no difference between man and man with regard to moral worth before God; nay, in this very chapter he forcibly declares the moral excellence of some, without the Law as well as with the Law, and eternal life as its reward (vers. 7, 10, 14, 15). All he implies of necessity is that none whatever are so exempt from sin as to be in a position to judge others; and it is the judgment of others that he here especially attacks, as increasing, rather than exempting from, condemnation. For it involves in itself the sin of presumption, unless those that judge are sinless. But it may be said that the universal sinfulness of mankind is still not proved. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it is not actually demonstrated that all of those who judge "do the same things." The answer to this objection is, that this does not admit of rigid proof, and that therefore the apostle deems it enough to appeal to the consciences of the judgers themselves as to how the matter stands with them. But it may be said <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the sinfulness of such persons as are spoken of in vers. 7, 10, 14, 15, 29-such, namely, as sincerely strive after good without setting themselves up as judges - is still unproved. So it is in this chapter; and, for logical completeness, the proof must be taken as implied. It was, we may suppose in the writer's mind, and afterwards, in ch. 7, where the inner consciousness of even the best is analyzed, the missing link of the argument is supplied. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest</span> (rather, <span class="accented">dost practise</span>; the word is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, see <a href="../../par/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the same things. But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit</span> (or, <span class="accented">practise</span>, as before) <span class="cmt_word">such things</span>. As has been observed above, the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> "does the same things," is not proved; it is incapable of patent proof, and so the argument takes the form of an appeal to the consciences of such persons. "Porro quia ipsos interioris impuritatis insimulat, quae ut humanos oculos latet, redargui convincique nequeat humanis testimoniis, ad Dei judicium provocat, cui nec tenebrae ipsae sunt absconditae, et cujus sensu tangi peceatoribus, velint nolint, necesse est" (Calvin). On <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, in ver. 2, Calvin also remarks, "Veritas porro haec judicii in duobus consistit: quod sine personarum respectu delictum puniet, in quocunque deprehenderit homine; deinde quod externam speciem non moratur, nec opere ipso contentus est nisi a vera sinceri-tate animi prodeat."

It may be here observed again that it is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> against whom these indignant denunciations are hurled, and this on the very ground of his thus setting himself up to judge while being himself guilty. Of him it is implied, not only that he shares the guilt of mankind, but also that he especially will not <span class="accented">escape</span> the final judgment. Of others who, conscious of their own failings, seek sincerely alter good, this is not said, however liable to condemnation on their own mere merits they may be. Indeed, the contrary is emphatically asserted in the verses that follow; nay, even eternal life is assured to such, whoever they may be, and under whatever dispensation, though it does not fall within the scope of the argument to explain in this place why or how. It is important for us to see this clearly for an understanding of the drift of the chapter, and of St. Paul's whole doctrine with respect to human sin and its consequences. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who will render to every man according to his works</span>. This assertion is no contradiction of the main portion of the Epistle as it proceeds, as to justification being not of works; the phrase here being, not on <span class="accented">account of</span> his works, but <span class="accented">according</span> to them. "Nequaquam tamen quid valeant, sed quid illis debeatur pretii pronunciat" (Calvin). The <span class="accented">ground</span> of justification is not here involved. All that is asserted is what is essential to any true conception of God's justice, viz. that he has regard to <span class="accented">what men are</span> in assigning reward or punishment; it is what is given in <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> as a first principle of faith about God, "that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him." It is further evident from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, and still more from all that follows, that all such will be so rewarded, whether before Christ or after his coming, whether knowing him or not knowing him. Nor is the inclusion of the latter inconsistent with the doctrine that salvation is through Christ alone. For the effect of his atonement is represented as retrospective as well as prospective, and as availing virtually for all mankind (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15, 18, 20</a>). Hence the narrow doctrine of some divines, who would confine the possibility of salvation to those who have had in some way during life a conscious faith in the atonement, is evidently not the doctrine of St. Paul.

So, too, the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui sunt ex contentione</span>; and similarly Origen, Chrysostom, OEcumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Calvin, etc. This, however, is not the classical sense of the word, which is not connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("strife"), but with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which means originally a day labourer, or a worker for hire, being so used in Homer. Hence <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> meant <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> labour for wages, and came to mean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> canvassing or intriguing for office, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> faction, or party-spirit (cf. Arist., 'Pol.,' 5. 2, 6; 3, 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Notwithstanding the weight of ancient authority for its bearing the sense of "contention" in the New Testament, that of "faction" seems more likely and suitable in the passages where it occurs; and certainly so here, the idea seeming to be that the persons spoken of <span class="accented">factiously</span> renounced their allegiance to "the truth," obeying <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> instead. We observe how expressions are here heaped up, significant of the Divine indignation against high-handed sin, unrepented and unatoned for, of which the apostle, in very virtue of his view of the eternal <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, had an awful sense (see above on Romans 1:18; and cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, etc.; and also <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). Still, neither this verse nor ver. 5 is of necessity inconsistent with other well-known passages, where St. Paul seems to contemplate God's reconciliation in the end of <span class="accented">all things</span> to himself in Christ (see <a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). The "indignation and wrath" spoken of in the passages before us (being, as was said under Romans 1:18, inseparable from a full conception of the eternal righteousness) may still be conceived as having a corrective as well as a punitive purpose. Nor is the doctrine which has been called that of "eternal hope" of necessity precluded by statements which imply no more than that sin, unrepented and unatoned for, must inevitably undergo its doom in the unknown regions of <span class="accented">eternity.</span> The thought, at the end of ver. 9, for the first time passes distinctly to the <span class="accented">Jew's</span> assumed exemption from the condemnation of the rest of mankind; and to this exclusively the remainder of the chapter is devoted. The "indignation," etc., it is said, will be upon the <span class="accented">Jew first</span> (cf. ch. 1:16), which may mean either <span class="accented">in the first instance</span>, or <span class="accented">principally.</span> His priority in Divine favor involves priority in retribution, while his pre-eminence in privilege carries with it corresponding responsibility (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>; also <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>-8 and <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). Then in ver. 10 a like priority is assigned to the Jew with respect to reward, the general assertion of ver. 7 being repeated (with some differ-once of expression) in order to complete the view of his prior position in both respects. For the covenant was with the Jews; the promises were to them: the Gentiles were as the wild olive tree, grafted in, and made partakers of the root and fatness of the olive tree (<a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>).

This, with what follows, is important, as bringing out in a striking way the clear doctrine of the New Testament that the Jews had no monopoly of Divine favour with respect to final salvation. Whatever advantages certain races of mankind seem undoubtedly to have above others in this world (and that this has been, and is so, with other races as well as the Jews is obvious), all men are described as standing on an exactly equal footing at the bar of eternal equity.

It may suffice to state certain principles for the reader's guidance, which appear plainly to commend themselves to acceptance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, with the article prefixed, always means the Mosaic Law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, without the article, may have, and often has, specific reference to the Mosaic Law; but, if so, the emission of the article is not arbitrary, but involves a difference of meaning. The article in Greek is prefixed to a word when the latter is intended to convey some definite idea already familiarized to the mind, and "the natural effect of its presence is to divert the thoughts from dwelling on the peculiar import of the word, and is adverse to its inherent notion standing out as a prominent point in the sense of the passage" (quoted from 'Grammar of the New Testament Dialect,' by T. S. Green, in Appendix to Introduction to Romans in the 'Speaker's Commentary '). Hence the omission of the article, where it might have been used, before a word has often the effect of emphasizing and drawing attention to the <span class="accented">inherent notion</span> of the word. We may take as an instance ver. 17 in this chapter, where the Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> but where the preferable reading omits the article. In either case the Mosaic Law is referred to; but the omission of the article brings into prominence the <span class="accented">principle</span> of justification on which the Jew rested - viz. <span class="accented">Law</span>, which exacts entire obedience. In the following verse (the eighteenth), in the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> the  article is inserted, the intention being simply to say that the Jew was instructed in the well-known Law of Moses. The same difference of meaning is intimated by the omission or insertion of the article in ver. 23 and elsewhere in other parts of the chapter and of the whole Epistle (see especially ch. 7.). The apostle, who, however spontaneous and unstudied might be his style of writing, by no means used phrases at random, would not surely have thus varied his expressions so often in one and the same sentence without intended significance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> without the article seems evidently in many passages to be used by St. Paul to denote law in the abstract, without any exclusive reference to the Mosaic Law at all, or to any particular code of law. Doubtless the Mosaic Law, in which he had been educated, and which he had painfully proved the impossibility of keeping perfectly, had been to him the grand embodiment and representative of law; but he had hence been led to an abstract conception, ever before his mind, of law as representing the principle of exaction of full obedience to requirements; and when he says, as he so often does, that by law no man can be justified, he means that none can be so on the principle of complete conformity being required to the behests of Divine righteousness, whether as revealed from Mount Sinai or through the human conscience, or in any other way; for by law is the knowledge of sin and consequent guilt, but not the power of avoiding sin. Those who ignore the distinction as above explained, saying, as some do, that <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whether with or without the article, always means simply the Law of Moses, fail to enter into the depth and generality of the apostle's argument. The distinction will be observed in this translation throughout the Epistle (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being translated "the Law," and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> "law"), and it will be found always to have a meaning. (For one instance in which it is hardly possible to suppose St. Paul to have omitted and inserted the article in the same sentence without a meaning, cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when Gentiles, which have not law, do by</span> <span class="cmt_word">nature</span> (or, <span class="accented">having not law by nature, do</span>; cf. ver. 27, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the things of the Law</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Mosaic Law), <span class="cmt_word">these, not having law, are law unto themselves; which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, with its usual significance of <span class="accented">quippequi</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness</span> (or, <span class="accented">bearing witness therewith</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and their thoughts betwixt each other accusing or else excusing</span> (not, as in the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f7a;</span> being used as a preposition, governing <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The "for" at the beginning of ver. 14 connects it with the preceding one thus: "Not <span class="accented">hearers</span> but <span class="accented">doers</span> of law will be justified." The Jew, therefore, has no advantage in the way of justification over the Gentile from being in a peculiar sense a <span class="accented">hearer. For</span> Gentiles also may be <span class="accented">doers</span>, though not of a positive revealed law, yet of the law of conscience. It is not, of course, implied that on the <span class="accented">ground</span> of any such <span class="accented">doing</span> they "shall be justified;" only that, so far as they <span class="accented">do</span>, they will, equally with the Jews, be rewarded. Nor is it said that any, in fact, do <span class="accented">all</span> that law enjoins. We observe the hypothetical form of expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc7;</span>, and also, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any of the Law's requirements. The Law, for instance, says, "Thou shalt not steal;" and if a Gentile, though knowing nothing of the ten commandments, on principle refrains from stealing, his conscientious honesty will have its own reward as much as that of the Jew who refrains in obedience to the revealed commandment. A few of the expressions in these verses call for consideration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, said to be "written in their hearts"? <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> cannot be pleonastic, as supposed by Tholuck. One view is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which is an expression frequently used elsewhere (<a href="../../par/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2, 5, 10</a>); and the singular number has been explained as <span class="accented">collective</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>, and ver. 7 above (so Meyer), or as "<span class="accented">applying</span> to each of the particular cases supposed in the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (so Alford). The objection to this view is that it is not the <span class="accented">works</span> of the Law that can be said to be <span class="accented">written</span>, but rather the Law itself from which the works proceed. Seeing that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> implies evident reference to the tables of the Law, it seems best to take <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as denoting the <span class="accented">efficacy</span> of the Law, as opposed to the <span class="accented">letter</span>, which alone was written on the tables. So in effect Bengel: "Legem ipsam cum sua activitate. Opponitur literae, quae est accidens." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> How do they <span class="accented">show</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) this <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>? Evidently, from the context of ver. 14, by <span class="accented">doing</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> doing them (as is, of course, implied) as being the <span class="accented">right</span> things to do, and approving them. The very possibility of their doing this is evidence of an innate moral sense in the human heart, which, however it may often be obscured or perverted, remains as a characteristic of humanity, and is more or less operative in all communities. "Nulls enim gens unquam sic ab humanitate abhorruit ut non se intra leges aliquas contineret. Constat absque dubio quasdam justitiae et rectitudinis conceptiones, quas Graeci <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> recant, hominum animis esse naturaliter ingenitas" (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> What is exactly meant by the <span class="accented">conscience</span> witnessing, and the <span class="accented">thoughts</span> accusing or else excusing? <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is not the Law in the heart, but rather our <span class="accented">consciousness</span>, whereby wittingly, in accordance with that Law, we approve or condemn. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote a <span class="accented">joint</span> witness of conscience. In <a href="../../par/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a> and Romans 9:1, where alone the word occurs elsewhere, it is followed by a dative, and means certainly <span class="accented">concurrent</span> witness. But, if so here, with what? Probably with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> already spoken cf. Right conduct on principle, and conscience approving, witness together to the inward law; or, conduct and conscience together witness to a man's merits or demerits in accordance with that law. Then, what is added about the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> shows how conscience operates. Reason comes into play, evoked by conscience, to reflect on its witness, and definitely condemn or approve what has been done. A kind of court of judicature is supposed. Man calls himself to the bar of his own moral judgment; his conscience adduces witness to the character of his deeds, or rather, with his deeds bears witness for or against himself; his thoughts are as advocates on both sides, arguing for condemnation or acquittal. "Observa quam erudite describat conscientiam, quum dicit nobis venire in mentem rationes, quibus quod recte factum est defendimus; rursum quae nos flagitiorum accusent et redarguant" (Calvin).

About this verse the main question is, what previous assertion the "when" refers to. The time denoted by "when" (whether we suppose <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the present or future tense - to have been intended by the writer) is certainly the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, and ether passages - the day of doom, when "every man's <span class="accented">work</span> shall be made manifest." Hence immediate connection of this verse with the preceding one, which would otherwise have been the natural one, seems to be precluded; for in ver. 15 the present operation of conscience, during this present life, was described. One way of making the connection obvious is by understanding ver. 15 as itself denoting the manifestation reserved for the day of judgment, when all will stand self-convicted. But not only the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the present tense, but also the fact of the whole verse being so obvious a description of present human consciousness, seems to preclude this view. Some would connect ver. 16 with ver. 12, of which it is in itself a natural sequence; and this connection is intimated in the Authorized Version, which includes the three verses that come between in a parenthesis. The objection to it is the length of the parenthesis. Probably the apostle, in his characteristic way, paid little regard to precise logical sequence; he only desired to express, in this concluding verse, that in the great day full justice would be done, and all that he had been speaking of would be made plain. <span class="accented">My gospel</span> means "the gospel committed unto me to preach" (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). The idea that it means "the Gospel according to St. Luke," said to have been written under St. Paul's superintendence, is too improbable to call for serious notice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if</span> (the true reading being certainly <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, as in the Textus Receptus) <span class="cmt_word">thou</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">art named a Jew</span>.

They are so called, whether resident in Palestine or elsewhere, throughout the New Testament, as well as by Roman writers. the term <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> being applied in the New Testament (usually at least) to distinguish those Jews who adhered to the Hebrew language in public worship, and to national customs and traditions, from those who <span class="accented">Hellenized</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). It was the name on which the people prided themselves at that time, as expressing their peculiar privileges. The apostle, having at the beginning of this chapter addressed himself generally to "whosoever thou art that judgest," now summons the Jew exclusively to the bar of judgment, whose claims to exemption from the general condemnation have come to the front in the preceding verses. By the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, he calls on him now to give an account of himself, and justify his pretensions if he can. The point of the argument is that the Jews were notoriously at that time no better than other nations in moral conduct - nay, their national character was such as to bring their very religion into disrepute among the heathen - and therefore <span class="accented">doing</span>, and not either privilege, knowledge, or profession, being according to the very <span class="accented">Law</span> on which they rested the test required, their whole ground for national exemption was taken away. <span class="cmt_word">And retest on law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, here without the article, so as to emphasize the <span class="accented">principle</span> on which the Jew professed to rest for acceptance), <span class="cmt_word">and makest thy boast of God</span>. The Jew gloried, as against the heathen, in his knowledge and worship of the one true God.

So far the Jew's own claims on the ground of his own position have been touched on; what follows expresses his attitude with regard to others. We may observe throughout a vein of irony.

Commentators differ as to what is meant. Some, considering that the word would not have been used except to denote something really sacrilegious - some offence against true sanctity - refer it to the withholding of gifts and offerings from the temple at Jerusalem, or of tithes from the priests, or embezzlement of the temple revenues. <a href="../../par/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>, etc., is adduced in illustration, "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings," etc. (cf. also <a href="../../par/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7-14</a>). A passage also is quoted from Josephus, 'Archaeol.,' B. 18, c. 5, where certain Jews are said to have appropriated to their own use purple and gold which had been given to them for the temple at Jerusalem by one Fulvia, a proselyte of theirs at Rome, in consequence of which the Emperor Tiberius, having been informed of the transaction by the lady's husband, had banished all the Jews from Rome. Others take the word in a general sense to denote any profanation of sanctity. So Luther, Calvin ("profanatio divinae majestatis"), and Bengel ("sacrilegium committi's, quia Deo non das gloriam, quae proprie Dei est"). Inasmuch, however, as definite malpractices of the Jews at that time, on account of which the name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles (ver. 24), seem to be here alluded to, the word may, perhaps more probably, be understood in its proper sense of <span class="accented">plundering temples</span>, meaning heathen temples - a practice which Jewish zealots, in their professed abhorrence of idolatry, might be addicted to when they had opportunity. A writer, though himself attaching no idea of sanctity to such temples, might still use the current term <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. SO, among the ancients, Chrysostom and Theophylact understand it; the latter, however, limiting it to taking away the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> He says, "For if they did abhor the idols, yet nevertheless, dominated by covetousness, they touched the idol-offerings for filthy lucre's sake." In doing this, he seems to imply, they broke the very Law which had enjoined their ancestors to "destroy the altars, and break down the images" of idolaters (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>); for the sauna Law had forbidden them to "desire the silver and gold that is on them," or "take it unto thee, for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). A strong confirmation of the view that plundering of heathen temples is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <a href="../../par/acts/19-37.htm">Acts 19:37</a>, when the town-clerk of Ephesus defended the Christians against the popular fury by declaring that they were not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, that is (as he might mean) not temple-plunderers, such as ordinary Jews had the reputation of being. It has been objected against this view that there is a lack of recorded instances of such temple-plundering on the part of Jews, and that they could not have had much chance, as things then were, of thus displaying their zeal. But there may have been instances, notorious at the time, though not recorded; and, if so, the drift may be, "Thou displayest thy abhorrence of idolatry, enjoined by the Law, by acts of violence and greed, such as the very Law forbids."

The reference is to <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>. The passage is not quoted as a prophecy now fulfilled, or as in its original reference exactly applicable, but only as serving to express well how the character of the Jews had brought their very religion into disrepute (el. Tacitus, 'Hist..' 5:4, etc.). The remainder of the chapter is devoted to a clear and final exposition of the principle, involved throughout all the previous verses, that Jewish privileges were of no profit in themselves, or without their meaning and purpose being understood and acted on. The thought now passes exclusively to circumcision, as being the original token of the covenant, and the Jew's rite of initiation into his whole privileged position (<a href="../../par/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>.). When <span class="accented">Jew</span> had come to be the peculiar designation of the children of the covenant, persons were said to become <span class="accented">Jews</span> by circumcision. Thus <a href="../../par/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, "And many of the people of the land became Jews," where the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It may be here observed that the known fact of other races as well as the Jews having practised, and still practising, circumcision is not subversive of the scriptural view of its being a peculiarly Jewish rite. For to the Jew alone it had a peculiar significance.

It denotes here one possessed of the true spirit of Judaism; in which sense the Gentile might be the better Jew. In a like double sense we may use the word "Christian" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;" also ch. 4. and <a href="../../par/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>). So, too, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> for spiritual circumcision (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), in the sense of inward dedication to God's service, and "<span class="accented">putting</span> off the body of the sins of the flesh" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; see also <a href="../../par/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2, 3</a>). Such ethical significance of the rite appears even in the Old Testament. We read there of "uncircumcised lips" (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12, 30</a>), or "ears" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), or "hearts" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>); and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a> we find the significant words." The LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy <span class="accented">seed</span>, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live;" and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, "<span class="accented">Circumcise</span> yourselves to the Loan, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem."
