Commentators have supposed that he went up to Jerusalem to pay his vows, and that the word of the Lord came unto him there. But all unnecessary details are omitted from the account, and we know nothing about this matter. The beginning of the next verse, "arise," seems to imply that he was then in some settled home, perhaps at Gath-hepher.

So Nimrod is called (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>) "a mighty hunter before the Lord;" and Moses, in <a href="../../par/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>, is said to have been" beautiful to God." The expression may also mean that God (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>, God as Governor of the world) regarded this city with interest, as intended in the Divine counsels to perform an important part. For he is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of three days' journey;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in circumference - about sixty miles (see note on Jonah 1:2). Or the writer may mean that it took Jonah three days to visit the various quarters of this huge place. The area of the vast quadrangle containing the remains of the four cities comprised under the name <span class="accented">Nineveh</span> is estimated by Professor Rawlinson at two hundred and sixteen square miles. We ought, however, to omit Khorsabad from this computation, as it was not founded till Sargon's time,  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">Jonah, undeterred by the danger of the enterprise, executes his mission at one, and announces the approaching destruction of the city. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Began to enter into the city a day's journey.</span> Jonah commenced his day's journey in the city, and, as he found a suitable place, uttered his warning cry, not necessarily continuing in one straight course, but going to the most frequented spots. At the time of Jonah's preaching the royal residence was probably at Chalah: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nimrud, the most southern of the cities. Coming from Palestine, he would reach this part first, so that his strange message would soon come to the king's ears (ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">Yet forty days.</span> "Forty" in Scripture is the number of probation (see <a href="../../par/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "yet three days" owing probably to some clerical error, as writing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;</span>. St. Augustine ('De Civit.,' 18:44) endeavours to explain the discrepaney mystically as referring to Christ under different circumstances, as being the same who remained forty days on earth after his resurrection, and who rose again on the third day. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be overthrown.</span> This is the word used for the destruction of Sodom (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>). The prophet appears to have gone on through the city, repeating this one awful announcement, as we read of fanatics denouncing woe on Jerusalem before its final destruction (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:05. 3). The threat was conditional virtually, though expressed in uncompromising terms. In the Hebrew the participle is used, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh overthrown," as though he saw at the end of the specified time the great city lying in ruins. One sees from <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-11.htm">Isaiah 36:11, 13</a>, that Jonah could readily be understood by the Assyrians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> &sect; 3. <span class="accented">The Ninevites hearken to the cry of Jonah, believe in God, and repent.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Believed God;</span> <span class="accented">believed in God</span>, which implies trust and hope; Vulgate, <span class="accented">crediderunt in Deum.</span> They recognized Jonah as God's messenger; they recognized God's power as able to execute the threat, and they had confidence in his mercy if they repented. This great result has seemed to some incredible, and has occasioned doubts to be east upon the history. But, as we have seen in the Introduction, Jonah's mission occurred probably at a time of national depression, when men's minds were disposed to expect calamity, and anxious to avert it by any means. Other considerations led to the same result. They had heard much of the God of the Hebrews, much of the doings of his great prophets Elijah and Elisha; and now they had in their midst one of these holy men, who, as they were informed, had been miraculously preserved from death in order to carry his message to them; for that it was thus that Jonah was "a sign unto the Ninevites" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a>) seems most certain. They saw the Divine inspiration beaming in his look, dictating his utterance, animating his bearing, filling him with courage, confidence, and faith. The credulity with which they received the announcements of their own seers, their national predilection for presages and omens, encouraged them to open their ears to this stranger, and to regard his mission with grave attention. Their own conscience, too, was on the prophet's side, and assisted his words with its powerful pleading. <span class="cmt_word">So they believed in God, and proclaimed a fast.</span> Spontaneously, without any special order from the authorities. Before the final fall of Nineveh, the inscriptions mention, the then king ordered a fast of one hundred days and nights to the gods in order to avert the threatened danger (see a note by Professor Sayce, in G. Smith's 'History of Babylon,' p. 156). <span class="cmt_word">Put on sackcloth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>). The custom of changing the dress in  token of mourning was not confined to the Hebrews (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-16.htm">Ezekiel 26:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him</i> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For word came;</span> <span class="accented">and the mater came</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the word came near" (Septuagint). The tokens of penitence mentioned in ver. 5 were not exhibited in obedience to any royal command. Rather, as the impression made by the prophet spread among the people, and as they adopted these modes of showing their sorrow, the news of the movement reached the king, and he put himself at the head of it. The reigning monarch was probably either Shalmaneser III. or one of the two who succeeded him, Asshur-danil and Asshur-nirari, whose three reigns extended from  <span class="date">B.C. 781</span> to 750. <span class="cmt_word">His robe</span> (<span class="accented">addereth</span>); the word used for the "Babylonish garment" in <a href="../../par/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he caused <i>it</i> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He caused it,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">he caused proclamation to be made, and said, i.e.</span> by the heralds. <span class="cmt_word">The decree.</span> The word used here (<span class="accented">taam</span>) is an Accadian term, which had become naturalized in Assyria, Persia, and Babylonia, and was applied to a mandate issued with royal authority. It is found in <a href="../../par/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-6.htm">Daniel 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a>, etc. Jonah introduces it here as being the very word employed in describing the proclamation. <span class="cmt_word">And his nobles.</span> The monarchs of Assyria were absolute; and if the king in the present case associated the magnates with himself, he did it in an humility occasioned by alarm, and because he saw that they were of the same mind as himself (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>. The decree extends from here to the end of ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">Man nor beast;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> domestic animals, horses, mules, distinct from herd and flock. These great cities contained in their area immense open spaces, like our parks, where cattle were kept. The dumb animals were made to share in their masters' fast and sorrow, as they shared their joy and feasting; their bleating and bellowing were so many appeals to Heaven for mercy; the punishment of these innocent creatures was a kind of atonement for the guilt of their lords (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; and note how the brute creation is said to sham in the happiness of paradise regained, <a href="../../par/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>.). The commentators quote Virgil, 'Ecl.,' 5:24, etc., where, however, the point is that the grief of the shepherds hinders them from attending to the wants of their flocks. Herodotus (9:24) mentions an instance of the Persians cutting the manes and tails of their horses and mules in a case of general mourning (comp. Eurip., 'Alcest.,' 428, etc.; Plut., 'Alex.,' 72). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-8.htm">Jonah 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <i>is</i> in their hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let man and beast be covered with sackcloth.</span> As we put trappings on horses in funerals. The LXX. wrongly makes this verse give an account of the execution of the edict instead of being part of the edict itself; thus: "And men and beasts were clothed with sackcloth," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Cry mightily;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let man cry mightily; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, "with intensity;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in fortitudine. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Let them turn every one from his evil way</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-5.htm">Jeremiah 25:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-3.htm">Jeremiah 36:3, 7</a>). The edict recognizes the truth that outward acts of penitence are worthless without moral reformation - a truth which the Jews themselves had been very loth to admit (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/58.htm">Isaiah 58</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And from the violence that is in their hands.</span> The acts of violence that their hands have committed (<a href="../../par/job/16-17.htm">Job 16:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>). This is the special sin of the Assyrians, always grasping after empire, oppressing other nations, and guilty of rapine and avarice at home (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9</a></div><div class="verse">Who can tell <i>if</i> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who can tell?</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-22.htm">2 Samuel 12:22</a>). An expression of hope that the Divine, wrath may be averted by the timely repentance. It is the same form of words as in <a href="../../par/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>, "Perhaps God would thereby indicate that he had himself put it into their mouths" (Pusey; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If God;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the one God, whom the king and his people now acknowledge as supreme, like the idol worshippers at Carmel, when they fell on their faces, crying, "Jehovah, he is the God" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a></div><div class="verse">And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it</i> not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">God accepts this repentance, and the threatened destruction is averted. <span class="cmt_word"></span>God saw their works</span>. There is no notice in the inscriptions of this "repentance," or of any change in the polytheistic worship of the Ninevites. But the existing records of this period are singularly meagre, and show a state of calamity and depression, of internal commotions and famine. Nor is it usual in the monumental history to find mention of any events but wars and the execution of material works; moral reformations are not recorded. <span class="cmt_word">God repented of the evil</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>). This is an anthropopathical mode of speaking; God acted as if, taking man's view of the transaction, he repented. The sentence was conditional, as Jonah well knew (<a href="../../par/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), in accordance with the great principle laid down in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7</a>, etc., viz. that if a nation against which sentence is pronounced turn from its evil way, the sentence shall not be executed. God does not change, but he threatens that man may change (see note on Amos 7:3; and observe the same principle applied to individuals, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-8.htm">Ezekiel 33:8, 13-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He did it not.</span> The evil day was postponed. This partial repentance, though it was not permanent and made little lasting  impression on the national life, showed that there was some element of good in these Assyrians, and that they were not yet ripe for destruction. It has been considered to be a proof of the unhistorical character of the Book of Jonah that no mention of any of the incidents is made in the Books of Kings and Chronicles; but there is nothing strange in this. Those records never touch external politics except as closely connected with Israel's fortunes; and, derived as they were from national annals, it would have been unnatural for them to have narrated events happening so far away, and not likely to be introduced in the documents on which their history was founded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jonah/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jonah 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jonah 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jonah/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jonah 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jonah 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
