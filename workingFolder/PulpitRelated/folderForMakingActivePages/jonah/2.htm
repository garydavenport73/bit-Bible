JONAH'S PRAYER AND DELIVERANCE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - 1<span class="accented">. Jonah, in the belly of the fish, offers a prayer of thanksgiving for his rescue from death by drowning, in which he sees a pledge of further deliverance.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jonah prayed.</span> These were his feelings when he sank in the waters and while he lay in his mysterious prison; he may have put them into their metrical form after his deliverance. The grammatical arrangement, and especially the language of ver. 7, seem to speak of a deliverance already experienced rather than of one expected. As this "prayer" does not suit an allegory, and as no cue but Jonah could have known its substance, we have here an argument for his authorship. It is rather a thanksgiving than a prayer - like that of Hennas (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). When he realizes that he was saved from drowning, he uttered his gratitude, and saw that he might hope for further rescue. How he passed the three days we cannot tell; some have thought he was unconscious; but thin is, perhaps, hardly consistent with the notice of his praying, and with the action of his great Antitype, who, during his sojourn in the unseen world, "preached to the spirits in prison" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His God.</span> He acknowledges Jehovah as his God. He had proved himself his by inspiration, by chastisement, and now by mercy (Pusey). The following prayer contains ample reminiscences of the Psalms, which would be familiar to a devout Israelite. Those quoted are mostly what have been considered to belong to David's time. if their date is really ascertained. But it is a matter of controversy, incapable of settlement, whether Jonah or the psalmist is the original.

The former are "breakers," the latter "rolling billows." The clause is from <a href="../../par/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>, Jonah transferring what is there said metaphorically to his own literal experience, at the same time acknowledging God's hand in the punishment by speaking of "<span class="accented">thy</span> billows" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/88-6.htm">Psalm 88:6, 7</a>).

The words are a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a>, altered somewhat to suit Jonah's circumstances. The psalmist says, "I said in my haste." Jonah says simply, "I said," without any limitation; and for "I am cut off," Jonah uses, "I am cast out." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - a strong term, implying banishment with violence. <span class="accented">Out of thy sight</span>; literally, <span class="accented">frown before thine eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from thy protecting care (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-24.htm">1 Samuel 26:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). He who had fled from the presence of the Lord in Canaan fears that he has forfeited the favour of God. <span class="cmt_word">Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</span> I will turn in prayer to that holy place where thou dost manifest thy presence. The Jews were wont to turn towards Jerusalem when they prayed (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>). Some think that Jonah expresses a hope of worshipping again in the temple; but the turn of expression in the text hardly warrants this. Others refer the term to the heavenly temple, as they do in ver. 7; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>.

Jonah sank to the bottom before he was swallowed by the fish. The LXX. omits the word.
