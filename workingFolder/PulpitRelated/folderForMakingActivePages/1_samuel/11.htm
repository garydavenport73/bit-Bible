He is there said to have shown kindness to David; and as we read in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a> that Abigal (so the Hebrew, not Abigail as the A.V., who was David's wife), Amasa's mother, was the daughter of Nahash, and as Abigal was the sister or half-sister of Zeruiah, David's aunt, there seems to have been some relationship between them. The Ammonites were old enemies of the Israelites, alleging that Israel had taken possession of territory east of the Jordan which rightfully belonged to them (<a href="../../par/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>); but after their defeat by Jephthah their power was so broken that they allowed a century to elapse before they ventured again to assert their claim. Nahash, apparently after other invasions (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>), now attacks Jabesh-Gilead, a city in the half-tribe of Manasseh, which had been cruelly treated by the Israelites (<a href="../../par/judges/21-10.htm">Judges 21:10</a>), but apparently had risen again from its ruins. Its inhabitants were willing humbly to submit to Ammonite rule; but Nahash will grant them no other terms than that they should let him <span class="cmt_word">thrust out</span> - Hebrew, bore through - <span class="cmt_word">all their right eyes,</span> not from any special spite against them, but as an insult to all Israel. No better proof could be given of the disorganisation of the nation  than that a petty despot should venture to show his contempt for it in so offensive a way. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this <i>condition</i> will I make <i>a covenant</i> with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it <i>for</i> a reproach upon all Israel.</div><div class="comm">

No miraculous influence is here meant; far more full of meaning and piety is the lesson so constantly taught in the Book of Judges, that all mighty and noble acts are from God (<a href="../../par/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>, etc.). Even the heathen saw in enthusiasm something Divine, for it means the having God within. The energy with which Saul acted was strictly natural, but yet as truly Divine; and it is a sign of the irreligion of modern days that it can see and hear of great and heroic achievements and assign no part in them to God. In the days of Samuel and the judges the whole glory of such acts was ascribed to God. But equally now, whenever men are moved to noble acts, it is "the breath of God" that descends upon them and inspires them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent <i>them</i> throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Acting then with Divine enthusiasm, Saul cut into pieces a yoke of oxen, and sent them <span class="cmt_word">throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers.</span> For a similar act see <a href="../../par/judges/19-29.htm">Judges 19:29</a>. Probably Saul cut the oxen into twelve pieces, and sent one to each tribe, with the threat that in case of disobedience their oxen would be similarly treated. The threat was moderate in that it did not touch their persons, but severe as regards their property, the labouring ox being man's faithful friend and servant. It is important also to notice that Saul speaks not only in his own name, but also in that of Samuel. It was as the man chosen of Jehovah to be king by the voice of his prophet that he acted, and so as one possessed of legitimate authority; and it seems also that Samuel went with him in person to the war (ver. 12). And the result answered to the energy with which Saul acted, for <span class="cmt_word">the fear of Jehovah</span> - or, rather, "a terror from Jehovah" - <span class="cmt_word">fell on the people, and they came out with one consent,</span> or, as it is rendered far more correctly and forcibly in the margin, "as one man." United by the kingly power, it was a nation that rose to defend one of its injured members. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-8.htm">1 Samuel 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He numbered them in Bezek</span>. This place was in the tribe of Issachar, and must be distinguished from that mentioned in <a href="../../par/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3, 4</a>, which was in Judah, and too remote from the scene of operations. And here Saul appears as the commander-in-chief; for the numbering included the forming of battalions, arranged in thousands, hundreds, and fifties, and the setting officers over them. These, naturally, were the chief men in each district. The result would be that, coming to Bezek, the appointed rendezvous, a disorderly multitude, they would leave it as an army arranged in order, and Saul, in the many difficulties that would arise, would have his first opportunity of showing his powers of command. <span class="cmt_word">Children of Israel,...  men of Judah</span> - the distinction which ended in the disruption of the nation. Judah, too, with its 30,000 men, is but poorly represented, nor is it a sufficient explanation of the small number who came that the tribe had enough to do at home in making head against the Philistines. As a matter of fact, Judah always stood apart until there was a king who belonged to itself. Then, in David's time, it first took an active interest in the national welfare, and it was its vast power and numbers which made him so powerful. Had it been so nearly overpowered by the Philistines, it could not so suddenly have sprung forth with a might which made it well nigh a match for all the rest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-9.htm">1 Samuel 11:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by <i>that time</i> the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed <i>it</i> to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow, by that time the sun be hot.</span> As Bezek is about twenty miles distant from Jabesh-Gilead, Saul would probably march most of the way that evening, and then, halting for food and sleep, would continue his advance early the next morning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-10.htm">1 Samuel 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow we will come out unto you</span>. This was apparently intended to throw the Ammonites off their guard, as they would suppose that the men of Jabesh-Gilead had given up all hopes of deliverance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it was <i>so</i> on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They came.., in the morning watch.</span> By a forced march Saul came upon the unsuspecting Ammonites just before daybreak, when sleep is deepest; and as his host was unwieldy, he arranged it in three divisions, assigning to each a different route, that they might not impede one another on the way, and might also cut off the retreat of  the enemy. As the fighting went on for five or six hours, <span class="cmt_word">until the heat of the day,</span> the Ammonites must at first have made some resistance; but when all three divisions of Saul's army had come up, they were so utterly routed that "no two of them were left together." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-12.htm">1 Samuel 11:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the people said unto Samuel, Who <i>is</i> he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people said unto Samuel.</span> Even after this glorious victory the people turn to Samuel, and doubtless his presence and influence had had great weight in gaining obedience to Saul's command (ver. 7). They now, with the old tumultuous violence, demand' that those who had opposed Saul's election should be put to death. Probably the ringleaders of Saul's opponents were some of the ciders disappointed at not being chosen themselves (see on 1 Samuel 10:27). But Saul displays, first, the kingly virtue of clemency, saying, <span class="cmt_word">There shall not a man be put to death this day</span> - a decision politic as well as generous, for bloodshed would have led only to future feuds; and, secondly, piety, in so humbly ascribing to Jehovah the salvation that had been wrought in Israel. SAUL SOLEMNLY CONSECRATED AS KING (vers. 14, 15). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.</div><div class="comm">

It was not far from Jabesh-Gilead, and naturally the victorious host would move from the field of battle to the nearest religious spot to consecrate their king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a></div><div class="verse">And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They made Saul king.</span> This is not to be interpreted, with the Septuagint, of a second anointing of Saul, but of his confirmation in the kingdom by the unanimous voice of the nation, whereas the first election of him at Mizpah had met with opposition. <span class="cmt_word">Before Jehovah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> with religious ceremonies conducted by Samuel and the high priest. The difference between Saul's election at Mizpah and the confirmation of it at Gilgal is much the same as between the first proclamation or' a king and his coronation. The latter is the nation's acknowledgment of his sovereignty, and the solemn consecration of him to his high office. <span class="cmt_word">Peace offerings</span> were tokens of joy and gratitude, and were followed by a feast.
