The phrase means that Jonathan's brave feat took place not many days after the garrison had occupied the cliff, probably only two or three, but without definitely stating how many. <span class="cmt_word">He told not his father.</span> Not only because Saul would have forbidden so rash an enterprise, but because secrecy was essential to any chance of success: probably too the purpose came upon him as an inspiration from above. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which <i>is</i> in Migron: and the people that <i>were</i> with him <i>were</i> about six hundred men;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the part nearest Geba. <span class="cmt_word">Under</span>, not <span class="cmt_word">a</span>, but <span class="accented">the<span class="cmt_word"></span> pomegranate tree</span>, the well known tree at Migron. Saul evidently shared to the full in the love of trees common among the Israelites (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a>). The Hebrew word for pomegranate is Rimmon, but there is no doubt that the tree is here meant, and not the rock Rimmon (<a href="../../par/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>), so called probably from a fancied resemblance to the fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Migron</span>, said to mean a <span class="accented">cliff</span> was apparently a common name for localities in this mountainous district, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a> we read of one lying to the north of Michmash, whereas this is to the south. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahiah, the son of Ahitub.</span> (See on 1 Samuel 13:9.) It is interesting to find the house of Eli recovering at last from its disaster, and one of its members duly ministering in his office before the king. It has been debated whether he was the same person as Ahimelech, mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>, etc., the supposition being grounded on the fact that Ahiah is never spoken of again. But he may have died; and with regard to the argument drawn from the similarity of the names, we must notice that names compounded with <span class="accented">Ah</span> (or Ach), brother, were common in Eli's family, while compounds with <span class="accented">Ab</span>, father, were most in use among Saul's relatives. Ahiah or Ahijah means <span class="accented">Jah is brother</span>; his father is Ahitub, <span class="accented">the brother is good</span>; why should he not call another son Ahimelech, <span class="accented">the brother is king?</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah's priest in Shiloh.</span> This refers to Eli, the regular rule in Hebrew being that all such statements belong, not to the son, but to the father. <span class="cmt_word">Wearing an ephod.</span> Literally, ephod bearing. The ephod, as we have seen on 1 Samuel 2:18, was the usual ministerial garment; but what is meant here is not an ordinary ephod of linen, but that described in <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7, 8</a>, <span class="accented">wherein was the breastplate, by which Jehovah's will was made known to his people, until prophecy took its place. All this, the former part of the verse, must be regarded as a parenthesis. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4</a></div><div class="verse">And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, <i>there was</i> a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one <i>was</i> Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Between the passages.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the passes. <span class="cmt_word">A sharp rock.</span> Literally, "a tooth of rock." Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:112) says, "The site of the Philistine camp at Michmash, which Jonathan and his armour bearer attacked, is very minutely described by Josephus. It was, he says, a precipice with three tops, ending in a long, sharp tongue, and protected by surrounding cliffs. Exactly such a natural fortress exists immediately east of the village of Michmash, and is still called 'the fort' by the peasantry. It is a ridge rising in three rounded knolls above a perpendicular crag, ending in a narrow tongue to the east, with cliffs below, and having an open valley behind it, and a saddle towards the west, on which Michmash itself is situate. Opposite this fortress, on the south, there is a crag of equal height, and seemingly impassable. Thus the description of the Old Testament is fully borne out - 'a sharp rock on one side, and a sharp rock on the other.' The southern cliff was called <span class="cmt_word">Seneh</span>, or 'the acacia,' and the same name still applies to the modern valley, due to the acacia trees which dot its course. The northern cliff was called <span class="cmt_word">Bozez</span>, or 'shining,' and the true explanation of the name only presents itself on the spot." Conder then describes how, "treading perhaps almost in the steps of Jonathan, after arriving on the brink of the chasm, or defile of Michmash, they were able to descend Seneh, even with horses and mules. "I noticed," he says, "that the dip of the strata down eastward  gave hopes that by one of the long ledges we might be able to slide, as it were, towards the bottom. It is not likely that horses had ever before been led along this ledge, or will perhaps ever again cross the pathless chasm, but it was just possible, and by jumping them down one or two steps some three feet high, we succeeded in making the passage....  Though we got down Seneh, we did not attempt to climb up Bozez .... Horses could scarcely find a footing anywhere on the sides of the northern precipice; but judging from the descent, it seems possible that Jonathan, with immense labour, could have 'climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour bearer after him' (ver. 13). That a man exhausted by such an effort could have fought successfully on arriving at the top can only be accounted for on the supposition of a sudden panic among the Philistines, when they found the enemy actually within their apparently impregnable fortress." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-5.htm">1 Samuel 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">The forefront of the one <i>was</i> situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was situate,</span> etc. The word thus translated is that rendered <span class="accented">pillar</span> in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>, and the verse should possibly be translated, "And the one tooth (or crag) was a rocky mass on the north over against Michmash, and the other was on the south over against Geba" (not <span class="accented">Gibeah</span>, as the A.V.; see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>). But the word is omitted in the versions, and may be an interpolation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for <i>there is</i> no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised</span>. An epithet of dislike almost confined to the Philistines. But underneath the whole speech of Jonathan lies the conviction of the covenant relation of Israel to Jehovah, of which circumcision was the outward sign. Notice also Jonathan's humble reliance upon God. <span class="cmt_word">It may be that Jehovah will work for us,</span> etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-7.htm">1 Samuel 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I <i>am</i> with thee according to thy heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn thee.</span> The Hebrew seems to have preserved the very words of the young man, and the difficulty in rendering this phrase arises from its being a colloquial expression. "Face about" would be our phrase; but the sense is, "On with you; I will follow." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-8.htm">1 Samuel 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto <i>these</i> men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.</div><div class="comm">

Hebrew, "be still," "stand still," the word used by Joshua of the sun (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12, 13</a>); but not the word rendered <span class="cmt_word">stand still</span> just below, where the Hebrew has, "We will stand under us," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> we will stop just where we were. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-10.htm">1 Samuel 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A sign.</span> The waiting of the garrison for Jonathan and his armour bearer to mount up to them would be a sign of great indifference and supineness on their part; but what he rather meant was that they were to regard it as an omen. Kim'hi has a long digression in his commentary on this place to show that there was nothing superstitous in their looking for a prognostic to encourage them in their hazardous undertaking. God, he says, bade Gideon go to the camp of the Midianites to obtain such a sign. as Jonathan looked for here (see <a href="../../par/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-11.htm">1 Samuel 14:11</a></div><div class="verse">And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Both of them discovered themselves.</span> They had crept up the precipice unseen, but at some convenient spot near the top they so placed themselves that the garrison must see them, and waited there till their presence was observed. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Hebrews.</span> There is no article in the Hebrew. What the Philistines say is, See! Hebrews come out of the holes wherein they had hid themselves. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-12.htm">1 Samuel 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.

The last clause is a popular phrase, and expresses a sort of amused contempt for the two adventurers. Raillery of this sort is not at all uncommon between the outposts of two armies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon his hands and upon his feet.</span> Of course a single stone rolled down upon them while thus clambering up the precipitous side of the cliff would have sent them to the bottom; but the Philistines, apparently considering the ascent impossible, seem entirely to have neglected them. The youthful appearance of the two no doubt contributed to throw them off their guard. <span class="cmt_word">And they fell before Jonathan.</span> The brevity of the Hebrew very well expresses the rapidity of Jonathan's action. Used to mountaineering, he was ready, as soon as he had reached the summit, to commence the attack, and the Philistines, little expecting so vigorous an onslaught from so feeble a force, were surprised, and made but a slight resistance. The armour bearer also behaved with a bravery like his master's. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-14.htm">1 Samuel 14:14</a></div><div class="verse">And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, <i>which</i> a yoke <i>of oxen might plow</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</span> The Hebrew for this long circumlocution is, "within about a half furrow of a yoke of land." The Septuagint translates, "with darts and slings and stones of the field," but the other versions give no support to this rendering. The Israelites, like most ancient nations, were accustomed to measure land by the quantity which a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, - something really less than an acre, - so that the A.V. gives the fight sense. When Jonathan made his attack, the garrison probably, not knowing bow few their assailants were, ran in confusion to the narrow tongue of land where the exit was, and getting in one another's way, were soon panic stricken and helpless. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a></div><div class="verse">And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">Trembling</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "terror," "fright." <span class="cmt_word">In the host.</span> Hebrew, "in the camp," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the main camp at Michmash, contrasted with <span class="cmt_word">the field,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the open country, in which the soldiers were foraging  for supplies. <span class="cmt_word">The people.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the camp followers, as opposed to the soldiers. All these were terrified by <span class="cmt_word">the garrison</span> rushing down the pass, with tidings of the attack magnified by their fears, and who communicated the alarm to <span class="cmt_word">the spoilers,</span> who, having now for a fortnight met with no resistance, had probably discontinued all measures of precaution. <span class="cmt_word">The earth quaked.</span> This may be taken literally, but is more probably a poetical description of the widespread terror and confusion which prevailed far and near. <span class="cmt_word">So it was a very great trembling.</span> Literally, "and it became a terror of God;" but the name of the deity (Elohim, not Jehovah) is constantly used in Hebrew to express vastness. DEFEAT OF THE PHILISTINES (vers. 16-23). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down <i>one another</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The watchmen,</span> etc. Condor says ('Tent Work,' 2:115), "The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin must have seen dearly across the chasm the extraordinary conflict of two men against a host, as the 'multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.' The noise in the host was also, no doubt, clearly heard at the distance of only two miles, and the army would have crossed the passage with comparatively little difficulty by the narrow path which leads down direct from Geba to Michmash, west of the Philistine camp. Thence the pursuit was towards Bethel, across the watershed, and headlong down the steep descent of Aijalon  -  that same pass where the first great victory of Joshua had been gained, and where the valiant Judas was once more, in later times, to drive back the enemies of Israel to the plains." <span class="cmt_word">The multitude.</span> The Hebrew is, "And behold the tumult (the word is so rendered in ver. 19, margin) was reeling and going...  and thither." Of course <span class="accented">hither</span> has dropped out of the text before and <span class="accented">thither</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate both read "hither and thither." Tumult means the din made by a confused mass of people, and so the crowd itself. <span class="cmt_word">Melted away</span> does not give the exact meaning. The Philistines were not dispersing, but were <span class="accented">reeling</span>, moving to and fro purposeless, and in confusion. It may mean, however, to <span class="accented">shake</span> or <span class="accented">melt with terror, as</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">art dissolved.</span>

The rest of the verse is a gloss added by some scribe struck at this strange mention of the ark, which we know was still at Kirjath-jearim. It is itself corrupt and ungrammatical, being, "For the ark of God was in that day and the children of Israel." Still both the reading <span class="accented">ark</span> and the gloss are very ancient, being found in the versions, except the Septuagint, as above.

With this necessary correction the translation is easy: "And the Hebrews who were previously with the Philistines, and had gone up with them into the camp, turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan." It appears, therefore, that certain districts of the Israelite territory were so completely in the power of the Philistines that they could compel the men to go with them, not perhaps as soldiers, as is our custom in India, but as drivers and servants. These now turned upon their masters, and were reinforced by the Israelites who had taken refuge in Mount Ephraim.

The versions have either "greedily desired," or "turned themselves unto."

The purpose of this stone was to raise up the caresses of the slaughtered animals from the ground, so that the blood might drain away from them. On tidings of this arrangement being dispersed throughout the army, the people obey Saul with the same unquestioning devotion as they had shown to his command to abstain from food.

On these words the question has arisen whether the meaning be that Saul began to build an altar, but with characteristic impetuosity left off before he had completed it; or whether on that occasion he commenced the custom followed by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>) of erecting altars as the patriarchs had done in old time. The latter interpretation is more in accordance with the usage of the Hebrew language, and is approved by the translations of the Septuagint and Vulgate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 14:36-52 JONATHAN'S DANGER AND DELIVERANCE (vers. 36-46).

The people render the same unquestioning obedience as before, but Ahiah gives counsel that they should first ask the approval of God. <span class="cmt_word">Let us draw near hither.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to the altar which Saul had just set up.

Thus twice in the same day he was guilty of the sin of rash swearing. The  people condemn him by their silence. They had obeyed him with ready devotion; but now they listen in terror to the rash and violent words which condemn to death the young hero by whom God had that day wrought deliverance for them.

He then prays, <span class="cmt_word">Give a perfect lot,</span> or, as in the margin, "Show" (literally, give) "the innocent." This is undoubtedly the meaning of the Hebrew, while the rendering of the text is taken from Kimchi. There are few mistranslations of the A.V. which have not some good Jewish authority for them, as King James's translators were singularly well versed in Jewish literature, while they seem strangely to have neglected the still higher authority of the ancient versions. These generally translate "Give holiness," a phrase equivalent to "Show the truth." The Septuagint and Vulgate add explanations, which, however, throw no light upon the passage.

But he must have been pained beyond measure at the miserable consequences of his rashness, and have bitterly reproached himself for thus twice marring the happiness of the day by unhallowed oaths. Jonathan's trespass, committed unwittingly, required nothing more than a trespass offering for its expiation, nor did the silence of the Urim and Thummim imply any fault in him. The fault lay in Saul having imposed an oath upon the army; that oath had been broken, and a formal expiation must be made. But Saul was by nature a despot, and could endure nothing that seemed even for the moment to stand in his way.

They do not say, however, <span class="cmt_word">God forbid,</span> but "Far be it." The name of the Deity is constantly taken in vain in the A.V. without adding either beauty or energy to the word of God. But even if it did, what right have translators to add energy to the word of God? <span class="cmt_word">He hath wrought with God this day.</span> The argument of the people is wise and good. Jonathan's whole conduct on that day proved an especial presence of God with him. It would be morally wrong and an offence against religion to condemn that which God approved, and the people therefore set their oath against the king's oath, and prevail.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a></div><div class="verse">So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Saul took the kingdom.</span> Instead of <span class="accented">so</span> the Hebrew has <span class="accented">and</span>, rightly; for this is no result or consequence of Saul's victory over the Philistines, but a mere historical introduction to the summary of his wars. The more correct translation would be, "When Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought," etc. Saul's reign was valiant and full of military glory. He was, in fact, in war all that the people had longed for, and not only. did he gain independence for Israel.. but laid the foundation of the vast empire of David and Solomon. But it is not the purpose of Holy, Scripture to give us the history of all Saul s valiant exploits, but only of his moral probation and failure. Of wars we read more than enough in profane history; here we read of the formation of character, and how a hero in the midst of noble and worthy feats of arms may yet lose something nobler and worthier - the favour of God. On every side. Moab and Ammon were on the east, Edom on the south, Zobah on the northeast, and the Philistines on the west. Zobah lay beyond Damascus, and, from the accounts given in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, must have been a powerful state. <span class="cmt_word">He vexed them.</span> The verb is a judicial one, used of punishing the guilty, and might be translated "he chastised them."

In thus forming a "school of heroes" he raised the whole spirit of the people, and took an essential and necessary step for maintaining Israel's freedom. With much of the despot in him, Saul had grand qualities as a soldier, and for many years admirably fulfilled the primary object for which he was chosen. And while he was thus giving the nation internal security, Samuel was teaching it how to use its growing prosperity, and was raising it in the scale of intellectual worth. If in the time of the judges we have Israel in its boyhood, as in the Sinaitic desert we have it in its infancy, under Saul and Samuel it reached its manhood, and became a powerful, vigorous, and well ordered community, able to maintain its freedom, and with means for its internal development in the schools of the prophets, which ended in making it not merely enlightened itself, but the giver of light to the rest of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_samuel/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Samuel 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_samuel/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Samuel 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
