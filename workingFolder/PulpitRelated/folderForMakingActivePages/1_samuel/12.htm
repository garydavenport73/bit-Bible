The metaphor is taken from the position of the shepherd in the East, where he goes before his flock to guide and guard them. On this account the word shepherd or pastor is used in the Bible of the temporal ruler (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, etc.), and not, as with us, of the spiritual guide. <span class="cmt_word">My sons are with you.</span> This is no mere confirmation of the fact just stated that he was old, but a direct challenge of their dissatisfaction with his sons' conduct, as far at least as concerns any connivance on his part, or support of them in their  covetousness. Samuel says, You know all about my sons; I do not profess to be ignorant that charges <span class="accented">have</span> been brought against them. Give full weight to them, and to everything said against them and me, and then give judgment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, here I <i>am</i>: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received <i>any</i> bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Witness against me.</span> Literally, "answer," as in a court of justice to the formal question of the judge. <span class="cmt_word">His anointed.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the king (see on 1 Samuel 2:10, 35; 2:1). <span class="cmt_word">Whose ox,... whose ass?</span> See on 1 Samuel 8:16. <span class="cmt_word">Of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?</span> Bribe should be rendered <span class="accented">ransom.</span> Literally it signifies a covering, and was used of money given by a guilty person to induce the judge to close or "blind his eyes," and not see his sin. It does not mean, therefore, any bribe, but only that given to buy off a guilty person. Such persons are generally powerful men who have oppressed and wronged others; and the knowledge that they can cover their offence by sharing their gains with the judge is to this day in the East the most fruitful source of bad government. The people all bear witness to Samuel's uprightness, nor is there any contradiction between this and their desire to have a king. His internal administration was just and righteous, but they were oppressed by the nations round them, and needed a leader in war. And in Samuel's sons they had men, not vicious or licentious, but too fond of money, and so neither fit to be their generals in war nor their judges in peace. We gather from <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a> that though Saul proved a competent leader in war, he was not successful in the government of the country in peace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-4.htm">1 Samuel 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.</div><div class="comm">

Then Samuel solemnly repeats Jehovah s name, saying, "Even Jehovah that advanced Moses and Aaron." This rapid interchange of words brings the whole scene vividly before us, whereas nothing could be tamer than the A.V. Out of the land of Egypt. Samuel begins with this as the first act of Jehovah as Israel's King; for the theocracy began with the deliverance from Egypt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stand still.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">station yourselves, take your places, stand forth</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-23.htm">1 Samuel 10:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I may reason with you.</span> Literally, "that I may deal as judge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that with all the authority of my office I may declare that Jehovah has acted justly by you, and that you have dealt unjustly with him. <span class="cmt_word">Righteous acts.</span> The margin, <span class="accented">benefits</span>, is wrong. Samuel vindicates God's dealings with them against the charge of his having failed to protect them implied in their demand for a king.

It was the repeated sin, therefore, of the people which made Israel's history so checquered. Sisera (<a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), the Philistines (<a href="../../par/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), and Eaton, king of Moab. (<a href="../../par/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), are mentioned as three of the earlier oppressors of Israel, but are given here in the reverse order to that found in the Book of Judges. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-10.htm">1 Samuel 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have served</span> [the] <span class="cmt_word">Baalim and</span> [the] <span class="cmt_word">Ashtaroth</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the numerous Baals and Astartes, which were worshipped under various titles by the heathen. For though representing the same power, each people had their own epithets for their own particular personification of the god (see on 1 Samuel 7:4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bedan</span>. Numerous ingenious explanations of this name have been given, but the only probable account is that Bedan is a misreading for Barak. The two names are very similar in the Hebrew, and the two most ancient versions, the Septuagint and the Syriac, actually have Barak. <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel.</span> This is even more puzzling than Bedan. We cannot suppose that Samuel, who hitherto had confined himself to the old deliverances, would thus suddenly introduce his own name. In mentioning only them he had avoided everything that would grate upon the ears of the people, but this would look like giving way to personal vexation. Some, therefore, would read Samson; but this, though found in the Syriac, is supported by no other version. Possibly some scribe, mindful of Samuel's recent achievement at Mizpah, wrote his name in the margin, whence it was admitted into the text. <span class="cmt_word">And ye dwelled safe.</span> Literally, "in confidence," in security. With sin came danger and unquiet; upon repentance, not only was their country free from danger, but their minds were at rest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a></div><div class="verse">And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God <i>was</i> your king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nahash the king of the children of Ammon.</span> This makes it probable that there had been threats of war, and even incursions into the Israelite territory, by Nahash before his attack on Jabesh-Gilead. We thus, too, should be able to account for the rancour displayed in his wish so to treat the men of that town as to make them a reproach to all Israel; for his hatred of Israel may have grown in intensity in the  course of a harassing war, or he may have learnt to despise a people incapable of offering a regular resistance. At all events, Samuel describes Nahash as giving the final impetus to the desire of the nation for a king. <span class="cmt_word">When Jehovah your God was your king.</span> See <a href="../../par/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-13.htm">1 Samuel 12:13</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, <i>and</i> whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold the king whom ye have chosen!... behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.</span> We have here the two sides of the transaction. The people had desired a king, chosen and appointed by themselves, to represent the nation in temporal matters; Jehovah gave them a king to represent himself, with authority coming from God, and limited by God. Most, too, of the kings of Judah were as truly representatives of Jehovah as any of the judges had been, and David even more so. <span class="cmt_word">Desired</span> is rather "demanded," "required." They had done much more than desire a king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14</a></div><div class="verse">If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye will fear,</span> etc. This verse, like <a href="../../par/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>, is left unfinished, and we must supply <span class="accented">well</span>, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>. For the verse cannot be translated as in the A.V., but is as follows: "If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment (Hebrew, the mouth) of Jehovah, and if both ye and the king that reigneth over you will follow Jehovah your God, <span class="accented">it shall be well."</span> Samuel piles up one upon another the conditions of their happiness, and then from the depth of his emotion breaks off, leaving the blessed consequences of their obedience unsaid. "To follow Jehovah" implies willing and active service as his attendants, going with him where he will, and being ever ready to obey his voice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-15.htm">1 Samuel 12:15</a></div><div class="verse">But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as <i>it was</i> against your fathers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against you, as it was against your fathers.</span> The Hebrew has "against you and your fathers," and so the Vulgate, for which the Septuagint reads, "against you and your king," as in ver. 25. The text is probably corrupt, and to make sense requires the insertion of some such words as those given in the A.V., with which the Syriac also agrees.

Naturally, therefore, this storm deeply impressed the minds of the people. Though not in itself miraculous, the circumstances made it so.
