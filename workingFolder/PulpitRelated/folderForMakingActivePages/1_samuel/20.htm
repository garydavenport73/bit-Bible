Some sort of reconciliation must have been patched up, probably by the mediation of Samuel; for David assumed that at the new moon be would be expected to dine at the king's table (ver. 5), and that Saul would look for him as a matter of course (ver. 6). We find, moreover, that his place was made ready, not only on the new moon (ver. 25), but also on the following day (ver. 26). But whatever professions Saul may have made to Samuel, it is evident that no promise had been made personally to David, and taught by past experience that the intention of slaying him had grown more and more fixed in the king's mind, he feels that his position is full of danger, and takes counsel with Jonathan, with the view of learning whether he might venture once again to take his place as a member of Saul s family. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-2.htm">1 Samuel 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it <i>is</i> not <i>so</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God forbid.</span> An exclamation of horror; literally, "Far be it" (see on 1 Samuel 14:45). In spite of the many proofs of Saul's bitter hatred, Jonathan cannot believe that after all that had taken place at Ramah his father would still persist in his murderous purpose. He further assures David that Saul would do nothing without telling him; literally, without uncovering his ear, without telling it him privately (see on 1 Samuel 9:15). The phrase is used again in ver. 12. For <span class="cmt_word">will do nothing</span> the written text reads "has done for himself," which the Kri properly corrects. The rashness of Saul's temper, and his frank talk about killing David recorded in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>, confirm Jonathan's statement about the openness of his father's ways, and he therefore assures David that he may take his place in safety. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a></div><div class="verse">And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly <i>as</i> the LORD liveth, and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth, <i>there is</i> but a step between me and death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy father certainly knoweth,</span> etc. Though Saul did not know the entireness of Jonathan's love for David, yet he was aware of the friendship that existed between them, and consequently might keep his purpose a secret from Jonathan, especially if he considered that his frankness in speaking openly to his son and servants on a previous occasion had led to David's escape. David, therefore, urges upon his friend a different course, to which he assents. But how are we to explain the entirely different views taken of Saul's conduct by the two. When David tells his fears Jonathan utters an exclamation of horror, and says, "Thou shalt not die." Yet he knew that his father had talked to him and his Officers about putting David to death; that he had tried to kill him with his own hand, and on his escape had set people to watch his house with orders to slay him; and on David's flight to the prophet had thrice sent emissaries to bring him away by force. The explanation probably lies in Saul s insanity. When he threw his javelin at David and during the subsequent proceed. ings he was out of his mind. The violent fit at Naioth had for the time cleared his reason, and he had come back sane. Jonathan regarded all that had taken place as the effect of a mind diseased, and concluded,  therefore, that David might now return to his home and wife, and resume his duties and take his place at the royal table. Should the old craze come back about David being his rival and destined successor, Saul would be sure to talk about it, and then Jonathan would give him timely warning. But David was convinced that it was no craze, but that Saul, sane or insane, had determined upon his death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-4.htm">1 Samuel 20:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do <i>it</i> for thee.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-5.htm">1 Samuel 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow <i>is</i> the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third <i>day</i> at even.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow is the new moon</span>. The first day of the new moon was a joyful festival, its appearance being greeted with the sounding of trumpets, and celebrated by a burnt offering and a sin offering. It was, moreover, kept by Saul as a family festival, at which David, as his son-in-law, was expected to be present. As, moreover, David was to hide <span class="cmt_word">unto the third day at even</span>, counting from the time when he was arranging his plans with Jonathan, it is plain that it was the rule to prolong the feasting unto the second day. When then Jonathan, convinced by David's pleading, had consented to aid him in his own way, they arrange that he shall absent himself from this festival, and remain during it hidden out of sight. In case Saul missed him and asked the reason of his absence, Jonathan was to offer as an excuse for him that he had earnestly requested leave to pay a hurried visit to Bethlehem, in order to be present at an annual festival: and if Saul took the excuse in good part it would be a sign that he had no malicious purposes towards David, whereas if he fell into a rage it would be a proof of a settled evil design. <span class="cmt_word">A yearly sacrifice for all the family.</span> For all the <span class="accented">mishpachah, i.e.</span> not for all Jesse's household, but for all that subdivision of the tribe of Judah to which Jesse belonged; for a tribe was divided into families, and these again into fathers' houses (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-16.htm">Joshua 7:16, 17</a>). The occasion would thus be a grand one. In <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2</a> we have an instance of a special sacrifice at Bethlehem, but this feast of the <span class="accented">mishpachah</span> was held every year; and evidently before the temple was built at Jerusalem these local sacrifices were the rule. We may well believe that there was such a festival, and that the fictitious part of Jonathan's story was that David had been summoned to it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked <i>leave</i> of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for <i>there is</i> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</div><div class="comm">

It was, moreover, Jonathan's own doing; and yet, <span class="cmt_word">if there be in me,</span> David says, <span class="cmt_word">iniquity</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> treason against Saul, if I have not been a faithful and true servant to him, but, on the contrary, have plotted evil against him, or now entertain any evil designs, then let the covenant be abrogated. David refuses to shelter himself under it if he has incurred guilt, and only asks that Jonathan, by the authority which he exercised as the king's son, should himself put him to death, and not deliver him up to Saul 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-9.htm">1 Samuel 20:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Far be it,</span> the word rendered <span class="accented">God forbid</span> in ver. 2. It indignantly rejects the idea of David having committed any crime. The rest of the verse is an incomplete sentence: "If I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, and did not tell thee -" These broken sentences have great force in the original, as signs of intense feeling (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>). We must complete the sentence mentally in some such way as the Syriac: "then Jehovah do so to me, and more also." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-10.htm">1 Samuel 20:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what <i>if</i> thy father answer thee roughly?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who shall tell me? or what if,</span> etc. The <span class="accented">if</span> is an insertion of the A.V. Really David's question is very involved and ungrammatical, as was natural in his excited state. It may be translated, "Who will tell me (or, how shall I know) what rough answer thy father will give thee?" But some Jewish authorities render, "Who will tell me if so be that thy father give thee a rough answer?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-11.htm">1 Samuel 20:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us go out into the field.</span> David's question had shown Jonathan that there were grave difficulties in their way, and so he proposes that they should walk into the country, to be able to talk with one another more freely, and concert measures for the future. And there Jonathan binds himself with a solemn oath, if Saul's intentions be good, to send a trusty messenger to inform David, but if there be danger, then to come and tell David himself. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God.</span> With a few MSS. we must supply the usual formula of an oath: "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth." <span class="cmt_word">About tomorrow any time, or the third day.</span> This cumbrous translation arose out of the mistaken idea that the word rendered <span class="cmt_word">tomorrow</span> could only be used in that limited sense. Strictly it signifies the <span class="accented">morning</span>, and is applicable to any morrow. Jonathan fixes one time, and one only, and the passage should be rendered, "By this time on the third morrow." The meeting was to be on the morrow after the second day of the festival, and so on the third morrow after the conversation. The whole may be translated, "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, when by this time on the third morrow I have searched my father, and, behold, there be good for David, if then I send not to thee, and uncover thy ear, Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan." The alternative case is then put, and if the news be evil, Jonathan undertakes himself to be the messenger, and David is to  provide for his safety by flight. The concluding prayer that Jehovah might be with David as he had been with Saul contains the same presentiment of David attaining to great power and dignity which is more directly expressed in the following verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, <i>or</i> the third <i>day</i>, and, behold, <i>if there be</i> good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father <i>to do</i> thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The construction of this passage is very difficult if we retain the three negatives of the Masoretic text; but most commentators, following the reading of the Syriac as regards at least one of them, consider that the Masorites have been mistaken in the vowels which they have attached to the consonants (see on 1 Samuel 1:7). Read with other vowels, two of these negatives become interjections of desire - <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">that</span>; and the whole may be translated, "And O that, while I still live, yea, O that thou wouldst show me the kindness of Jehovah, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> great unfailing kindness, such as was that of Jehovah to Israel, - that I die not, nor shalt thou cut off thy kindness from my house forever." It was the sanguinary custom in the East on a change of dynasty to put all the seed royal to death (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-11.htm">1 Kings 16:11</a>, etc., and comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>). As then Jonathan foresaw that it was Jehovah's will to transfer the kingdom to David, he binds him by the memory of his own true love to him to show mercy to his race. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-15.htm">1 Samuel 20:15</a></div><div class="verse">But <i>also</i> thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-16.htm">1 Samuel 20:16</a></div><div class="verse">So Jonathan made <i>a covenant</i> with the house of David, <i>saying</i>, Let the LORD even require <i>it</i> at the hand of David's enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - This verse also is very difficult, but it is probably to be taken as an insertion of the narrator: "So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David" - that is, so as to bind his descendants - "saying, Let Jehovah require it at the hand of David's enemies." These last words probably are a euphemism, and mean David himself. So Rashi explains the words. The courtesy of an Oriental forbade his saying, May Jehovah punish David for it, but he prays that God would requite it on some one. But if the Divine anger visits even David's enemies for it, how much more the guilty perjurer himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-17.htm">1 Samuel 20:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan caused David to swear again.</span> So strong was his conviction in David's future kingdom, and his wish that there should be an unbroken bond of love between the two families, that he makes David solemnly repeat his promise. The Septuagint and Vulgate, by altering the vowels, read, "And Jonathan sware again to David." At first sight this interpretation seems most in accordance with the reason given for the renewal of the oath, namely, Jonathan's own love; but the Masoretic text agrees better with what has gone before, and with his wish that their covenant under no change of circumstances should be broken. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-18.htm">1 Samuel 20:18</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow <i>is</i> the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - Jonathan now arranges his plan for communicating the result to David. For <span class="cmt_word">when thou hast stayed three days</span>, at which all the versions stumble, a slight alteration gives the right sense: "And on the third day." David on the third day was to <span class="cmt_word">go down quickly</span> - Hebrew, "greatly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he was to go a long way down into the valley. The rendering <span class="accented">quickly</span> is taken from the Vulgate, but makes no sense. It did not matter whether David went fast or slow, as he was to hide there for some time, but it was important that David should be far away, so that no prying eye might chance to catch sight of him. <span class="cmt_word">When the business was in hand.</span> Literally, "the day of the business," probably that narrated in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-2.htm">1 Samuel 19:2-7</a>. The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Chaldee all understand "a working day," in opposition to a feast day; but "where thou didst hide thyself on a week day" gives no intelligible meaning. By the stone Ezel. As the name Ezel is formed from a verb signifying <span class="accented">to go</span>, some understand by it a <span class="accented">road stone</span>, a stone to mark the way. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>when</i> thou hast stayed three days, <i>then</i> thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was <i>in hand</i>, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</div><div class="comm">

Jonathan was to shoot three arrows at this stone, Ezel, as his mark, and was then to send his servant to gather them up. When he bad gone some distance Jonathan was to shout to him, loud enough for David to hear. If Jonathan said that the arrows were on that side the mark, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between it and Jonathan, David was to come forth boldly, as all was well. But if Jonathan said that the arrows were further on, then David must understand that he was to seek safety in flight. For <span class="cmt_word">there is peace to thee, and no hurt,</span> the Hebrew has "there is peace to thee, and it is nothing," a simpler and more idiomatic rendering. As touching the matter, etc. Rather, "As for the word that we have spoken, I and thou, behold, Jehovah is between me and thee forever." The <span class="accented">word</span> was the bond and covenant by which they had pledged their truth to one another. Though separated, their love was to continue, and Jehovah was to be their eternal centre of union, and the witness to their covenant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

David's absence on the second day made Saul aware that it was no accident, and he demands of Jonathan the reason; whereupon he gives the excuse previously arranged, adding that it was David's brother who had required his attendance. The Septuagint has <span class="accented">brothers</span>, being offended at the singular, because Jesse was still alive.

His indignation was roused not merely at his father having thus brandished his javelin in his face, for he was sitting close to Saul, but because he had cast shameful aspersions upon David in saying that he was a rebel, and deserved death.

Phillipson remarks, "The scenes in this chapter are some of the most affecting presented to us in history, whether in old or modern times, and we may Well wonder at the delicacy of feeling and the gentleness of the sentiments which these two men in those old rough times entertained for one another. No ancient writer has set before us so noble an example of a heart felt, unselfish, and thoroughly human state of feeling, and none has described friendship with such entire truth in all its relations, and with such complete and profound knowledge of the human heart." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
