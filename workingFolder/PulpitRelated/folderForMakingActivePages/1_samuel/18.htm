There would then be a muster of the Israelites, and Abner would naturally present the youthful champion to the king, who is represented as having virtually forgotten him, and as anxious to learn his history; nor had his stay been long enough for Abner to remember him. As this conversation is narrated as an introduction to the account of Jonathan's friendship for David, the last four verses of ch. 17. ought to be prefixed to ch. 18. A new beginning commences with them, in which we are told of the commencement of this friendship, of the growth of Saul's hatred, and of the trials which befell David, proceeding on the king's part from bad to worse, till at last he was driven away and compelled to lead the life of an outlaw. But by his envy, cruelty, and bad government Saul was alienating the minds of the people from him, and preparing the way for his own downfall and David's ultimate triumph. The episode of Jonathan's love is as beautiful as Saul's conduct is dark, and completes our admiration for this generous and noble hero. <span class="cmt_word">The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David.</span> These kindred spirits had so much in common that, as David with modest manliness answered the king's questions, an intense feeling of admiration grew up in the young warrior's heart, and a friendship was the result which ranks among the purest and noblest examples of true manly affection. The word rendered <span class="accented">knit</span> literally means <span class="accented">knotted</span>, tied together firmly by indissoluble bonds. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-2.htm">1 Samuel 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul took him that day.</span> Bent solely on war, Saul gladly took so promising, a young soldier as David to be one of his bodyguard (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>), and henceforward he was constantly with him. Thus in two ways, first as a musician, and now as a soldier, David was forced into those intimate relations with Saul, which ended so tragically. For a while, however, those happier results ensued summed up in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan and David made a covenant.</span> We are not to suppose that this happened immediately. David continued on friendly terms with Saul for a considerable period, during which he went on many expeditions, and grew in military renown (see ver. 5). And thus the love which began with admiration of David's prowess grew deeper and more confirmed by constant intercourse, till this solemn bond of mutual friendship was entered into by the two youthful heroes, by which they bound themselves under all circumstances to be true and faithful to one another. How nobly Jonathan kept the bond the history proceeds immediately to tell us; nor was David subsequently unmindful of it (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>:l, 7). <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan stripped himself of the robe,</span> etc. In confirmation of the bond Jonathan gave David first his <span class="accented">robe</span>, the <span class="accented">meil</span>, which, as we have seen on 1 Samuel 2:19, was the ordinary dress of the wealthier classes; and next <span class="cmt_word">his garments,</span> his military dress (see on 1 Samuel 17:38, 39), worn over the <span class="accented">meil</span>, and which here seems to include his accoutrements, - the bow, sword, and girdle, - though elsewhere distinguished from them (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>). In thus clothing David in his own princely equipments Jonathan was showing his friend the greatest personal honour (<a href="../../par/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8</a>), and such a gift is still highly esteemed in the East.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, <i>and</i> behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David went out.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> went on military expeditions (comp. ver. 30). As the verb has thus a technical signification, it makes a complete sense, and the verse should be translated, "And David went forth (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on warlike enterprises); whithersoever Saul sent him he prospered, and Saul set him over the men of war." These expeditions were not upon a very large scale; for it is not until ver. 13 that we read of David being made "captain over a thousand." Still, even while only a centurion in rank, yet, as being in constant attendance upon the king, he would often temporarily have the command of larger bodies of men, or would go on campaigns as one of the king's officers. As it is mentioned that his promotion caused no envy because of his great merits, it follows that it was rapid enough to have given occasion to ill will under ordinary circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">Behaved himself wisely.</span> This is the primary meaning of the verb; but as success is the result of wise conduct, it constantly signifies <span class="accented">to prosper.</span> This verse is a summary of events which may have occupied a very considerable space of time. It was only gradually that David's fame became so great as to rouse all the worst feelings in Saul's mind. SAUL'S HATRED OF DAVID (vers. 6-16). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine.</span> Or more probably, as in the margin, "of the  Philistines." The allusion is not to the combat with Goliath, but to one of the expeditions referred to in ver. 5, in which David had gained some decisive victory. The women would not have described the slaughter of one champion as the slaying of ten thousand, nor would there have been any contrast between this act and the military enterprises of Saul. Probably he too would have looked with indifference upon this Oriental exaggeration of the daring bravery of a boy; but what galled him was David's continual success in repeated campaigns. <span class="cmt_word">The Philistine</span> means the whole people of that name; and as the war between them and Saul lasted all the days of Saul's life, and was his main kingly work, he saw with envy the rapid growth of David's reputation; and when, after some noble achievement, the women gave David an ovation, and declared in their songs that he had achieved a success ten times as great as Saul, an outburst of ill feeling was the result. Saul suddenly became aware that the young captain on whose shoulders he had devolved the chief labours of the war had supplanted him in the popular estimation, and hatred took the place of the good feeling which he had previously entertained towards him. <span class="cmt_word">The women came out of all cities of Israel...  to meet king Saul.</span> It is evident that this refers to some grand occasion, and probably to the conclusion of a peace between the two nations. The battle in the valley of Elah was probably followed by several years of warfare, during which David developed those great military qualities which made him subsequently the founder of the wide empire over which Solomon reigned. It was unendurable for Saul, himself a great soldier, to find, when the war at last was over, that the people recognised in his lieutenant higher military qualities than they had discovered in himself. <span class="cmt_word">With tabrets.</span> See on 1 Samuel 10:5. <span class="cmt_word">With joy.</span> As this is placed between the names of two instruments of music, it must mean some kind of joyous shouting or singing to the sound of their tabrets. <span class="cmt_word">With instruments of music.</span> Hebrew, with triangles, a very ancient but effective instrument for an outdoor procession accompanied with dancing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the women answered <i>one another</i> as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The women answered.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> they sang alternately. It was this alternate singing which led to the psalms being composed in parallel sentences, and not in metre; and we from the temple service have inherited our method of chanting antiphonally. <span class="cmt_word">As they played.</span> The word is ambiguous, and to an English reader would suggest the idea of the women playing upon the musical instruments. It usually refers to merriment, and so in <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-5.htm">Zechariah 8:5</a> it is used of the children <span class="accented">playing</span> in the streets, but especially it refers to dancing. Thus in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-14.htm">2 Samuel 2:14</a> it is used of a war dance ending in a real conflict; and again (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>) of David dancing to instruments of music, before the ark. Michal probably would not have despised David for playing an instrument of music during a religious ceremony; it was the posturing of the dance which seemed to her beneath the dignity of a king. So these women danced in alternate choruses to the beating of their tambourines and triangles. In <a href="../../par/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>, where, however, it is in a different conjugation, the verb is translated "to make sport." Really Samson was compelled to dance Israel's national war dance before the Philistines. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed <i>but</i> thousands: and <i>what</i> can he have more but the kingdom?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What can he have more?</span> etc. Literally, "And there is beside for him only the kingdom. Though many years had passed since Samuel pronounced Saul's deposition, and the choice of another in his place (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>), yet it was not a thing that a king could ever forget. No doubt he had often looked out for signs of the person destined to be his successor; and now, when he had stood powerless before the enemy, a shepherd boy had stepped forth and given him the victory. And this stripling, taken to be his companion in arms, had shown so great qualities that the people reckoned him at ten times Saul's worth. Had Saul been the high-minded man he was when appointed to the kingdom (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a>), he would have thrust such thoughts from him. But his mind had become cankered with discontent and brooding thoughts, and so <span class="cmt_word">he eyed David from that day and forward.</span> In many nations the eye of an envious man is supposed to have great power of injury. Here it means that Saul cast furtive glances at David full of malice and ill will. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-9.htm">1 Samuel 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and <i>there was</i> a javelin in Saul's hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It came to pass on the morrow</span>. The day had been a time of public triumph, and yet one of the chief actors goes home to a sleepless couch, because he thinks that another has received higher honour than himself. His melancholy deepens till a fit of insanity comes on. For <span class="cmt_word">the evil spirit from God came upon Saul.</span> Literally, " an evil spirit (breath) of God descended mightily upon Saul" (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-15.htm">1 Samuel 16:15</a>). Just as all mighty enthusiasms for good come from God, so do strong influences for evil, but in a different way. In all noble acts men are fellow workers with God; when evil carries them away it is of God, because he it is who has made and still maintains the laws of our moral nature; but it is by the working of general laws, and not by any special gift or grace bestowed by him. Saul had brooded over his disappointment, and cherished feelings of discontent at his own lot and of envy at the good of others to such an extent that his mind gave way before the diseased workings  of his imagination. And so he lost all control over himself, and <span class="cmt_word">prophesied</span>. The conjugation employed here (Hithpahel) is never used of real, true prophecy (which is always the Niphal), but of a bastard imitation of it. Really Saul was in a state of frenzy, unable to master himself, speaking words of which he knew not the meaning, and acting like a man possessed. In all this there was something akin to the powerful emotions which agitated the true prophet, only it was not a holy influence, but one springing from violent passions and a disturbed state of the mind. In order to soothe him <span class="cmt_word">David played with his hand, as at other times,</span> but without the desired effect. On the contrary, Saul brandished the javelin, which he carried as a sort of sceptre in his hand, with such violence that David twice had to escape from this threat of injury by flight. It is not certain that Saul actually threw the javelin. Had he done so it would be difficult to account for David escaping from it twice. After such an act of violence he would scarcely have trusted himself a second time in Saul's presence. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">Saul cast the javelin,</span> the Septuagint in the Alexandrian codex and the Chaldee render <span class="accented">lifted, i.e.</span> retaining the same consonants, they put vowels which refer the verb to another root. But even with the present vowels it may mean "made as though he would cast," or aimed "the javelin." On a later occasion Saul actually threw the javelin, and struck the wall where David had been sitting (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall <i>with it</i>. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</div><div class="comm">

To his jealousy succeeded a sense of powerlessness, as knowing that a higher power was with David, while he had lost the Divine protection. This miserable feeling grew upon the unhappy king, till before the battle of Gilboa we find him with all his old heroic spirit gone, a miserable wreck, seeking for comfort at the hands of a woman of the most worthless kind (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-5.htm">1 Samuel 28:5, 7, 20</a>). In this despondent state of mind he dismisses David from attendance upon him, but in an honourable manner, giving him the command of a thousand men, at the head of whom <span class="cmt_word">he went out and came in before the people,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a public capacity, as an officer of state. As Saul seems entirely to have neglected the internal administration of the kingdom, this would refer to military expeditions (see on ver. 5); and in these <span class="cmt_word">David behaved himself wisely.</span> Rather, "prospered" (see on ver. 5). His great success only increased Saul's fears; but both <span class="cmt_word">Israel and Judah loved David,</span> now that in this higher command they had full opportunities for judging of his high qualities. Thus again his removal from his place in Saul's bodyguard only served to make him better known. The separate mention of Israel and Judah is an indication of the Books of Samuel having been written at a post-Solomonic date, though the distinction was a very old one (see on 1 Samuel 11:8).

After long delay Saul now refers to this promise, not so much with the intention of fulfilling it, as of leading David on to enterprises which might cost him his life. The marriage may have been deferred at first on account of David's youth; the subject is now revived, but with evil intentions. <span class="cmt_word">My eider daughter</span> is literally "my daughter, the great one," while Michal is "the little one," a way of speaking used only where there are but two daughters. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou valiant,</span> etc. This exhortation would be natural under the circumstances; but Saul hoped that David, in order to secure so great a prize, would be encouraged to undertake rash adventures. <span class="cmt_word">For Saul said.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> in himself; his purpose was to urge David to perpetual fighting, that so in some rash undertaking he might be slam. Thus Saul s malice grows, and though not prepared as yet to put David to death himself, he would have felt relief if he had died by the fortune of war. David answers modestly and discreetly that he is not worthy of so great an honour. We are not to suppose that he discerned Saul's treachery, which only came-to light afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">What is my life,</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my condition,  - <span class="cmt_word">or my father's family?</span> The <span class="accented">or</span> is not in the Hebrew, and the meaning is, What is my condition, even my father's family? etc. David's condition or rank in life was settled by the rank which his father held.

He was not an ungenerous man, and possibly may have felt ashamed at having acted so meanly by David after having exposed him to danger. And yet evil thoughts again are uppermost, and his purposes are selfish; for either way Saul will be the  gainer. David will probably be slain, he thinks, in trying to get the dowry asked of him; and if not, at all events he will himself be cleared of the stain of public dishonesty now resting upon him. Therefore <span class="cmt_word">Saul said to David.</span> Not in person, which accounts for David giving no answer, but through his servants, as is recounted more fully afterwards.

We cannot suppose that Saul first spoke to David himself, and then told his servants to coax him, as this would also require us to suppose that when offered her by Saul, David refused Michal in marriage. But we may well believe that he was displeased at having been deceived, and that the renewed proposal of marriage with one of the king's daughters had to be made carefully, as he might naturally think that there was danger of his being cajoled a second time. David replies, in fact, very discreetly, saying that to be the king's son-in-law was indeed a great honour, but that he was too poor to provide a sufficient dowry. Strictly the promises given in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a> bound Saul to give her without dowry; but it appears quite plainly from David's words that he had lost Merab because not able to purchase her as Adriel had done. For the custom of giving large sums to the bride's father see <a href="../../par/genesis/34-12.htm">Genesis 34:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16, 17</a>.

As this slaughter would have to be effected not in regular warfare, but in a sort of private raid, there would be every likelihood of David being overpowered by a rapid gathering of the Philistines and slain in attempting it. It marks the unscrupulous character of ancient warfare that the lives of enemies should thus be taken, without any public provocation, for private purposes (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>).
