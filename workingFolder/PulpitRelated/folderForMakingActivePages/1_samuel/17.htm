We are, however, briefly told that "there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>), and apparently this inroad took place very many years after Saul's establishment upon the throne. The Philistine camp was at <span class="cmt_word">Ephes-dammim</span>, called Pas-dammim in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-13.htm">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>. The best explanation of the word gives as its meaning <span class="accented">the boundary of blood</span>, so called from the continual fighting which took place there upon the borders. <span class="cmt_word">Shochoh</span>, spelt more correctly <span class="accented">Socoh</span> in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>, was one of fourteen villages enumerated there as lying in the Shephelah, described by Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:156) as a region of "low hills of limestone, frowning a distinct district between the plain and the watershed mountains." In this district Socoh lay northeast of Eleutheropolis (Beth-jibrin), midway between it and Beth-shemesh, from each of which places it was distant about eight or nine miles. It is now called <span class="accented">Shuweikeh.</span> For <span class="cmt_word">Azekah</span> see <a href="../../par/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The valley of Elah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> of the terebinth tree. A valley between them. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:160) describes the spot from personal observation thus: "Saul, coming down by the highway from the land of Benjamin, encamped by the valley on one of the low hills; and between the two hosts was the <span class="accented">gai</span> or ravine." In the A.V. no exactness of rendering is ever attempted, and both the <span class="accented">emek</span>, the broad strath or valley of Elah, with gently sloping sides, and the flag, the narrow, precipitous ravine, are equally rendered <span class="accented">valley.</span> Really the <span class="accented">gai</span> is most remarkable, and fully explains how the two hosts could remain in face of one another so long without fighting; for Conder proceeds, "Two points require to be made clear as to the episode of David's battle with Goliath: one was the meaning of the expression <span class="accented">gai</span> or ravine; the other was the source whence David took the 'smooth stones.' A visit to the spot explains both. In the middle of the broad, open valley we found a deep trench with vertical sides, impassable except at certain places - a valley in a valley, and a natural barrier between the two hosts. The sides and bed of this trench are strewn with rounded and waterworn pebbles, which would have been well fitted for David's sling. Here, then, we may picture to ourselves the two hosts, covering the low, rocky hills opposite to each other, and half hidden among the lentisk bushes. Between them was the rich expanse of ripening barley, and the red banks of the torrent, with its white, shingly bed. Behind all were the distant blue hill walls of Judah, whence Saul had just come down. The mail clad champion advanced from the west through the low corn, with his mighty lance perhaps tufted with feathers, his brazen helmet shining in the sun. From the east a ruddy boy in his white shirt and sandals, armed with a goat's hair sling, came down to the brook, and, according to the poetic fancy of the Rabbis, the pebbles were given voices, and cried, 'By us shalt thou overcome the giant.' The champion fell from an unseen cause, and the wild  Philistines fled to the mouth of the valley, where Gath stood towering on its white chalk cliff, a frontier fortress, the key to the high road leading to the corn lands of Judah and to the vineyards of Hebron." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-3.htm">1 Samuel 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and <i>there was</i> a valley between them.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height <i>was</i> six cubits and a span.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">A champion.</span> Literally, "a man of the two middles," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who enters the space between the two armies in order to decide the contest by a single combat. <span class="cmt_word">Of Gath.</span> In <a href="../../par/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a> this town is mentioned, together with Gaza and Ashdod, as still having among its inhabitants men of the race of Anak. <span class="cmt_word">Whose height was six cubits and a span.</span> In our measure his height was eight feet five and one-third inches; for the cubit is sixteen inches, and the span (really the hand-breadth) is five and one-third inches. A span, <span class="accented">sit</span>, is eight inches, but the word used here is <span class="accented">zereth.</span> See on these measures, Conder, 'Handbook,' p. 79. This height, though very great, has been attained to in modern times. <span class="cmt_word">Armed with a coat of mail.</span> Literally, "clothed in a shirt of scales," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a corselet made of metal scales sewn on cloth so as to overlap one another. It was flexible, and protected the back and sides as well as the kent. <span class="cmt_word">Five thousand shekels of brass.</span> Really copper, as brass was then unknown. Conder gives the shekel as equal to two-thirds of an ounce. This would make the corselet weigh at least two hundred weight, an enormous load to carry even for a short time. Goliath's other equipments correspond in heaviness, and largely exceed the weight of medieval suits of armour. <span class="cmt_word">Greaves of brass upon his legs.</span> The thighs were protected by the corselet, so that only the legs required defensive armour. This would account for the weight of the corselet, as it was much longer than the cuirass, as worn by the Greeks and Romans. <span class="cmt_word">A target.</span> Really, "a javelin." It was carried at the back, ready to be taken in the hand and thrown at the enemy when required. The versions have a different reading - <span class="accented">magan</span>, shield, for <span class="accented">chidon</span>, javelin. The shield was carried before him by an armour bearer. <span class="cmt_word">The staff.</span> The written text has a word which usually signifies <span class="accented">shaft, arrow</span>, for which the Kri substitutes <span class="accented">wood</span>, the noun actually found in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; but most probably the word used here is an archaic name for the handle or staff of a spear. <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred shekels.</span> The weight of the iron head of the spear would be about twenty-five pounds. However tall and strong Goliath may have been, yet with all this vast weight of metal his movements must have been slow and unready. He was got up, in bet, more to tell upon the imagination than for real fighting, and though, like a castle, he might have been invincible if attacked with sword and spear, he was much too encumbered with defensive armour to be capable of assuming the offensive against a light armed enemy. To David belongs the credit of seeing that the Philistine champion was a huge imposition.

The same word is used throughout (see vers. 10, 20, 21, 22, 26, 45). <span class="cmt_word">Am not I a Philistine?</span> Hebrew, "the Philistine," the champion on their side. <span class="cmt_word">I defy the armies.</span> Hebrew, "I have cast scorn or insult upon the ranks of Israel this day." The sense is not so much that he defied them as that they were dishonoured by not accepting his challenge. <span class="cmt_word">They were dismayed.</span> That is, terrified, and made uncertain what to do (comp. Jeremiah 1:36). We have seen from Mr. Condor's account that each army held an impregnable position on the two sides of the ravine, which neither could cross without the certainty of being defeated in the attempt by the other side. Under such circumstances there seemed no way of deciding the contest except by a single combat. But though Saul and his warriors were too terrified at Goliath's appearance to venture to meet him, still they held their ground for forty days, inasmuch as it was evidently impossible for him to cross the ravine clad in such cumbrous armour, nor did the Philistines venture to make the attempt, us the Israelites would have taken them at a manifest disadvantage. DAVID'S VISIT TO THE CAMP (vers. 12-31). The Vatican codex of the Septuagint omits the whole of this section, and it was inserted in the Alexandrian copy by Origen. It is found, however, in the other versions; and possibly this treatment of David's history as of a person unknown, just after the account given of him in ch. 16, did not seem so strange to readers in old time as it does to us, with whom reading is so much more easy an accomplishment. It is, nevertheless, one of the many indications that the Books of Samuel, though compiled from contemporaneous documents, were not arranged in their present form till long afterwards. It was only gradually that Samuel's schools dispersed throughout the country men trained in reading and writing, and trained up scholars capable of keeping the annals of each king's reign. The Books of Kings were, as we know, compiled from these annals; but probably at each prophetic school there would be stored up copies of Psalms written for their religious services, ballads such as those in the Book of Jashar, and in the Book  of the Wars of Jehovah, narratives of stirring events like this before us, and histories both of their own chiefs, such as was Samuel, and afterwards Elijah and Elisha, and also of the kings. There is nothing remarkable, therefore, at finding information repeated; and having had in the previous narrative an account of a passing introduction of David to Saul as a musician, which led to little at the time, though subsequently David stood high in Saul's favour because of his skill upon the harp, we here have David's introduction to Saul as a warrior.

Some explain this as meaning "placed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "reckoned among men of rank;" but probably an aleph has dropped out in the word rendered men, and we should read <span class="accented">"gone," i.e.</span> "advanced in years."

Apparently it had been but a short visit, possibly because after the fit of melancholy had passed away there was no return of it for the present; and if David had been back at Bethlehem for two or three years, a young man changes so much in appearance at David's time of life that it is no wonder that neither Saul nor Abner recognised him in his shepherd's dress. For some reason, then, or other David had not remained with Saul at Gibeah, but had resumed his pastoral life at Bethlehem, and the statements made in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a> belong to the time immediately after the combat with Goliath, and not before.

This verse takes up the narrative, disturbed by the inserted explanation about David's family relations. The extraordinary formation of the ground, as described in ver. 3, shows how it was possible for this challenge to go on for forty days without either army advancing or retiring. During this long time it seems to have been the business of the friends at home to supply the combatants with food, and so Jesse sends David with <span class="cmt_word">an ephah</span>, about three pecks, <span class="cmt_word">of parched corn</span> - as the word is spelt in the Hebrew it means "parched pease." Also <span class="cmt_word">ten loaves,</span> and, for the captain of their thousand, <span class="cmt_word">ten cheeses</span> - rather, "ten slices of fresh curd." David was also <span class="cmt_word">to take their pledge</span>.

There had manifestly been a great advance since the day when Jesse sent the king a few loaves of bread, a skin of wine, and a kid (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>). Still we cannot imagine that Saul had introduced taxes, nor was the political organisation of the State ripe enough for so advanced a state of things. The words more probably refer to freedom from personal service in the army and elsewhere; though it is quite possible that on special occasions contributions may have been levied, and presents, no doubt, were constantly being made to the king, though on no regular system. <span class="cmt_word">Taketh away the reproach.</span> The noun formed from the verb rendered <span class="accented">defy in</span> ver. 10, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised</span>.

He may have served with credit in repelling some Philistine foray, but these combats with wild beasts, fought without the presence of spectators, and with no regent necessity (as most shepherds would have been too glad to compound with such enemies by letting them take a lamb without molestation), still more clearly proved David's fearless nature. Lions and bears were both common in ancient times in Palestine, when the country was more densely covered with wood; and bears are numerous in the mountainous districts now. Lions seem to have been less feared than bears (<a href="../../par/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>); but Canon Tristram thinks there were two species of the lion in Palestine - one short-maned, which was not very formidable, the other long maned, which was more fierce and dangerous ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 117). The Hebrew literally is, "There came the lion and even the bear," the articles implying that they were the well known foes of the shepherd. The written text has <span class="accented">zeh</span>, "this," for <span class="accented">seh</span>, "a lamb," probably a mere variety of spelling. There can be little doubt that David refers to two different occasions, especially as bears and lions never hunt in company. <span class="cmt_word">By his beard.</span> Neither the bear nor the lion has a beard, and the word really means "the chin," "the place where the beard grows." The Chaldee translates <span class="accented">the lower jaw</span>, and the Septuagint <span class="accented">the throat.</span> It is plain from this description that David slew the beast with his staff. <span class="cmt_word">He arose against me.</span> This shows that the combat thus particularly described was with the bear, which does thus rise on its hind legs to grapple with its foe, while the lion crouches and then springs. Pliny also says that the weakest part of a bear is its head, and that it can be killed by a smart blow there. The manner in which David killed the lion is not described. <span class="cmt_word">Defied</span>. See on ver. 10.

It was a courageous act in Saul to give his permission, considering the conditions of the combat (see ver. 9), but the two arguments here given persuaded him: the first, David's strong confidence in Jehovah, insuring his courage; and, secondly, the coolness and bravery he had shown in these dangerous encounters with savage animals. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul armed David with his armour.</span> Rather, "Saul clad David in his war dress." The word does not mean <span class="accented">arms</span>, either offensive or defensive; for in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>, where it is rendered "clothes," we read of its being rent. It occurs again in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>, and is there rendered "garments." Strictly it was the soldier's coat, worn under his armour, and girt close to the body by the sword belt. It does not follow that David was as tall as Saul because he thus put on his military coat; for it would be adjusted to the body by the belt, and its length was not a matter of much consequence. When, then, it is said that <span class="cmt_word">David girded his sword upon his armour,</span> it means upon this coat, though the corselet of mail would also be worn over it. He assayed to go. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he made an attempt at going, took a short walk thus arrayed, making trial all the while of his equipments; and he found them so cumbrous that he felt that he would have no chance against the Philistine except as a light-armed soldier. The agility of his movements would then make him a match for one so heavily overweighted as Goliath. Wearing, therefore, only his shepherd's dress, armed only with a sling, David descended into the ravine which separated the two armies, chose there five pebbles, and, clambering up the other side, advanced towards the Philistine. For <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> the Hebrew has "torrent bed." Condor speaks of a torrent flowing through the ravine (see on ver. 2). COMBAT OF DAVID AND GOLIATH (vers. 41-54).

As the giant's helmet had no visor, that protection not having as yet been invented, and his shield was still carried by his armour bearer, his face was exposed to David's missiles. And in those days, before firearms were invented, men by constant practice "could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss" (<a href="../../par/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). And even if David were not quite as skilful as those Benjamites, yet, as the giant could move only very slowly, the chances were that he would hit him with one or more of his five pebbles. As it was, he struck him at his first attempt upon the forehead with such force that Goliath was stunned, and fell down upon his face to the ground.

The narrator also calls attention to the fact that David relied upon his sling alone, for <span class="cmt_word">there was no sword in the hand of David.</span> Slings probably were regarded as useful only to harass an enemy, while swords, which they had only lately been able to procure (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>), were regarded as the real weapons of offence. David, therefore, completes his victory by killing Goliath with his own sword as he lay stunned upon the ground. As Ahimelech considered it fit for David's own use (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>), it was probably not so monstrous in size as Goliath's other weapons. <span class="cmt_word">Champion</span> is not the word so rendered in vers. 4, 23, but that used in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a> for "a <span class="accented">hero</span> of valour."

The panic which struck the Philistines when they saw their champion fall enabled the Israelites to do so, but the pursuit only then commenced. The Septuagint reads Gath, a very probable emendation, for, as we saw in the passage quoted from Condor on ver. 2, Gath was situated at the mouth of the terebinth valley.

This is an anticipation of later history.

Abravanel supposes that by David's tent was meant the tabernacle of Jehovah, but this would surely have been stated more fully. Either, however, now, or at some later period, David must have presented the sword as an offering to the tabernacle, as it was laid up at Nob, whence he took it with him in his flight (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>).

It is plain from what is stated here that David had not thus far spent time enough at Gibeah to be personally well known either to Saul or his officers (see note on ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Stripling</span>. Not <span class="accented">na'ar</span>, but <span class="accented">alem</span>, the masculine of the word <span class="accented">almah</span>, used in  <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>.
