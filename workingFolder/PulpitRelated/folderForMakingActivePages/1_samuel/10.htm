Throughout Holy Scripture the office of king appears as one most sacred, and it is the king, and not the priest, who is especially called Messiah, Jehovah s anointed (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>, etc.), because he represented the authority and power of God. <span class="cmt_word">And kissed him.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> did homage to him, and gave him the symbol and token of allegiance (see <a href="../../par/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is it not?</span>.... A strong affirmation often takes the form of a question, especially when, as probably was the case here, surprise is manifested. Saul, on whom the occurrences of the previous day must have come as strange and unintelligible marvels, was no doubt still more embarrassed when one so old and venerable, both in person and office, as Samuel solemnly consecrated him to be Israel's prince (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>), and gave him the kiss of fealty and allegiance. Samuel, therefore, answers Saul's inquiring looks with this question, and, further, gives him three signs to quiet his doubts, and convince him that his appointment is from God.

The whole of the geography of Saul's wanderings is very obscure, but Wilson ('Lands of the Bible,' 1:401) places <span class="cmt_word">Zelzah</span> at Beit-jala, to the west of Bethlehem, in the neighbourhood of the Kabhet Rahil, or Tomb of Rachel, Though both are now in the tribe of Judah, yet by a slight rectification of the frontier, in conformity with <a href="../../par/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11-28</a>, Zelzah would be on the border of Benjamin, and there may have been local reasons for Saul and his companion not taking the most direct route for Gibeah. The news given by these men, that the asses were found, would set Saul's mind at rest, and, freed from lower cares, he would be able to give his thoughts entirely to preparation for the higher duties that were before him. For an interesting note upon the journey of Saul home see Wilson, 2:36. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> The second sign was to be the presenting of an offering to him out of their sacrificial gifts by three men going on a pilgrimage to Bethel. He would meet them not <span class="cmt_word">in the plain of Tabor,</span> but at the oak, <span class="accented">elon</span>, of Tabor. Many attempt to connect this <span class="accented">elon-Tabor</span> with the <span class="accented">allon</span>, or oak, under which Deborah, Rachel's nurse, was buried (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>), and suppose that Tabor is a corruption of the name Deborah. This is scarcely possible, and it is better to acknowledge that we know nothing of the site of this tree, except that it was on the road to Bethel. This was one of the places which Samuel used to visit as judge (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>); but these men were on a pilgrimage thither because since the days of Jacob it had been a sacred spot, and a chief seat of the old patriarchal worship, for which see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-4.htm">1 Samuel 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they will salute thee, and give thee two <i>loaves</i> of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - These pilgrims would <span class="cmt_word">salute</span> Saul, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> give him the usual friendly greeting of travellers, and would then present to him, a stranger, two loaves of the bread intended for their offering at Bethel.

And Saul was to <span class="cmt_word">receive of their hands</span> the present, as being now his due, for by anointing him Samuel had designated him as king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where <i>is</i> the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The third sign was to be his taking part with the prophets in their religious exercises in <span class="cmt_word">the hill of God</span> - really Gibeah, his own home. Gibeah is strictly a rounded hill, while Ramah is a height. This <span class="accented">Gibeah ha-Elohim</span> was probably that part of the hill on which the "high place" was situated, and which was evidently outside the city; for Saul, on his route homeward, met the troop of prophets descending from it. For "Gibeah of Saul" see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; but, as Conder remarks, this name was given to a district as well as to a town, inasmuch as Ramah is described as situated within it - <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a> ('Tent Work,' 2:111). <span class="cmt_word">The garrison of the Philistines</span> was probably on some height in this district, and, coupled with the mention of similar military posts elsewhere (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4</a>), shows that most of the tribe of Benjamin was subject to that nation, and disarmed (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>); but probably, as long as the tribute was paid, its internal administration was not interfered with <span class="cmt_word">A company of the prophets.</span> At Gibeah Samuel had established one of his "schools of the prophets," by means of which he did so much to elevate the whole mental and moral state of the Israelites. The word rendered <span class="accented">company</span> literally means a cord or line, and so a band of people. These prophets were descending from the Bamah (see on 1 Samuel 9:12), where they had been engaged in some religious exercise, and were chanting a psalm or hymn to the  music of various instruments. Music was one of the great means employed by Samuel in training his young men; and not only is its effect at all times elevating and refining, but in semi-barbarous times, united, as it is sure to be, with poetry, it is the chief educational lever for raising men's minds, and giving them a taste for culture and intellectual pleasures. The musical instruments mentioned are the <span class="cmt_word">psaltery</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">nebel, a</span> sort of harp with ten strings stretched across a triangle, the longest string being at its base, and the shortest towards its apex; the <span class="cmt_word">tabret</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">toph</span>, a tambourine struck by the hand; the <span class="cmt_word">pipe</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">chalil, i.e.</span> "bored" or "pierced," so called from the holes bored in it to make the notes, and being probably a sort of flute; and, lastly, the <span class="cmt_word">harp</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">cinnor</span>, a sort of guitar, chiefly used for accompanying the voice, and sometimes played with the fingers, and sometimes with a plectrum or quill. There is nothing to indicate that there was only one of each of these instruments, so that the articles would be better omitted. No doubt every prophet was playing some one or other of them. And they shall prophesy. The conjugation used here is not that employed for the prediction of future events, but means, literally, and they will be acting the prophet, the right word for men who were in training for the prophetic office (see 'Prophecy a Preparation for Christ,' 2nd ed. p. 50). They were really engaged in chanting God's praises with fervour, and this was no doubt one of the methods employed by Samuel to refine and spiritualise their minds. Years afterwards David was thus educated, and learned at one of Samuel's schools that skill in metre and psalmody which, added to his natural gifts, made him "the sweet singer of Israel." For <span class="accented">prophesying</span>, in the sense of playing instruments of music see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-3</a>, and in the sense of chanting, <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-29.htm">1 Kings 18:29</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee.</span> The Hebrew means, will come mightily upon thee, will come upon thee so as to overpower thee. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt prophesy.</span> Shalt act as a prophet (see above).

It is no argument against it that Gilgal was the place where in the mean while Saul was solemnly inaugurated king; for he was appointed in order that he might deliver Israel from the Philistines (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>), and we may feel sure that this grand purpose would form the subject of conversation between the prophet and the soldier, either on the house-top or the next morning. In this conversation Gilgal would be selected as the place where Saul would assemble Israel for the war of independence (so Rashi and other Jewish interpreters); and so great an enterprise must necessarily be begun with religious rites, and Saul was to wait a full week for the prophet's coming, both to try his faith, which ought to have been confirmed by the fulfilment of the three appointed signs, and in order that the war might be undertaken under the same holy auspices as his own election to the kingdom. The two years' interval, were it really so long, would give time for Saul's character to develop under the forcing influences of royalty, and it would then be proved, when he felt himself every inch a king, whether he was still as amenable to the Divine authority as when he was first summoned from obscurity to mount a kingly throne. But, really, the words in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a> do not justify this conclusion, and most probably the occurrences mentioned in that chapter followed immediately upon Saul's confirmation as king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-9.htm">1 Samuel 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">And it was <i>so</i>, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God gave him another heart.</span> The Hebrew is remarkable: "When he turned his shoulder to go from Samuel, God also turned for him another heart," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God turned him round by giving him a changed heart. He grew internally up to the level of his changed circumstances. No longer had he the feelings of a husbandman, concerned only about corn and cattle; he had become a statesman, a general, and a prince. No man could have gone through such marvellous events, and experienced such varied emotions, without a vast inward change. But it might have been only to vanity and self-complacency. Saul's change was into a hero. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the hill.</span> Hebrew, "to Gibeah," his home. <span class="cmt_word">He prophesied.</span> Took part in prophetic exercises (see on Ver. 5).  On seeing this, the people of Gibeah, <span class="cmt_word">who knew him beforetime</span>, - Hebrew, "from yesterday and the day before," but equivalent to our phrase "for years," - asked in surprise, <span class="cmt_word">What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?</span> What makes him thus act in a manner unlike all our long past experience of him? <span class="cmt_word">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> From this question two things are evident: the first, that the schools founded by Samuel already held a high place in the estimation of the Israelites; the second, that Saul had not shared in that education which so raised the prophets as a class above, the mass of the people. Probably also Saul s character was not such as would have made him care for education. A young man who, while living in his neighbourhood, knew so little about Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a>), could not have had a very inquiring or intellectual frame of mind. Of course Samuel could not, by gathering young men together, and giving them the best education the times afforded, gain for them also the highest and rarest of gifts, that of direct inspiration. Even when Elisha, the friend and attendant upon Elijah, asked his master for an elder son's portion of the Divine spirit, Elijah told him that he had asked a hard thing (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>). The disparity then that the people remarked between Saul and the prophets was that between a rich young farmer's son, who had been brought up at home, and cared only for rustic things, and these young collegians, who were enjoying a careful education (comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>). How good that education was is proved by the fact that at David's court all posts which required literary skill were held by prophets. No man could found schools of inspired men; but Samuel founded great educational institutions, which ended by making the Israelites a highly trained and literary people. Saul's prophesying was not the result of training, but came to him by a Divine influence, rousing the slumbering enthusiasm of an energetic but fitful nature.

The meaning rather must be, You ask about the son of Kish; but what has birth to do with prophecy? None of these young men have inherited these gifts, and if Saul can take part in their prophesyings, why should he not? Kish, his father, is no worse than theirs. <span class="cmt_word">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> Under very different circumstances Saul once again took part in the exercises of these youthful prophets (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), and evidently on both occasions with such skill and success as prove the readiness of his genius; and so struck were the people at the strange power which he thus evinced, that their expression of wonder became fixed in the national mind as a proverb. Saul was a man of great natural ability, and yet not the sort of person whom the people expected would be made king. He probably could neither read nor write, and from his extreme height was perhaps awkward and bashful; as he suffered afterwards from fits of insanity (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>), he may always have been flighty and wilful; and altogether, though possessed of marvellous gifts, was certainly the very opposite of Samuel's well trained and orderly scholars.

The conversation probably took place after Saul had returned from the Bamah and gone to his own home, for in so brief a summary much necessarily is omitted. It is curious that the conversation should have taken place with the uncle, and not with the father; but possibly the latter was too well pleased to have his son back again to be very particular in his inquiries. Not so Abner. He was evidently excited by his nephew s visit to the prophet, and struck perhaps by the change in Saul himself, and would gladly have heard more. But Saul does not gratify his curiosity. <span class="cmt_word">Of the matter of the kingdom...  he told him not.</span> It was not merely prudent, but right to keep the matter secret. An able man like Abner would probably have begun to scheme for so great an end.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-21.htm">1 Samuel 10:21</a></div><div class="verse">When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The family of Matri,</span> or of the  Matrites. Matri is not mentioned anywhere else; and numerous as are the omissions in the genealogies, we can scarcely suppose that the name of the head of one of the main subdivisions of a tribe could be passed over. The conjecture, therefore, is probable that Matri is a corruption of Bikri, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a descendant of Becher, for whom see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-8.htm">1 Chronicles 7:8</a>. After the lot had fallen upon this family they would next cast lots upon its smaller subdivisions, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/7-17.htm">Joshua 7:17, 18</a>, until at last they came to households, when first Kish, and finally Saul was taken. The latter, foreseeing that this would happen, had concealed himself. For though a noble change had taken place in him (ver. 9), yet no really worthy man was ever promoted to high office without having to overcome his own unwillingness, and no one probably ever worthily discharged solemn duties without having felt oppressed and humbled with the consciousness of his own unfitness to undertake them. As a matter of fact, Saul was now called to a most weighty responsibility, and he failed and was rejected, though not without proving that he was a man of extraordinary genius and power. And it never can be said of him that presumption was the cause of his fall, or that he hastily undertook serious duties in the spirit of light-hearted levity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">They inquired of Jehovah further, if the man should yet come thither.</span> More correctly, "Is any one as yet come hither?" The Septuagint and Vulgate translate as if there were an article before "any one" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">a man</span>), and give, "Is the man coming hither?" But the Hebrew text is the more satisfactory. For the object of the inquiry, made by the Urim and Thummim, was to find Saul, wherever he might be; and the enigmatical way of putting the question, Is any one as yet come? was regarded as more reverential than asking directly, Is Saul come? <span class="cmt_word">Among the stuff.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the baggage, as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-22.htm">1 Samuel 17:22</a>, where it is translated "carriage." The people, collected from all Israel, would come with wagons and provisions, and such arms as they could procure; for very probably the Philistines would interrupt such a meeting, as they had that convened formerly by Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>). Naturally, therefore, they would follow the regulations of an army, and so arrange their baggage as to form a place of defence in case of attack. See on 1 Samuel 17:20. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-23.htm">1 Samuel 10:23</a></div><div class="verse">And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he stood.</span> This rendering spoils the poetic force of the original, where the rapidity of their action is expressed by three preterites following hard upon one another. The Hebrew is, "And they ran, and took him thence, and he stood forth (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>) among the people, and he was taller," etc. And now Samuel presents him to the multitude as "the chosen of Jehovah," and the people shout their assent by saying, "Let the king live." For this the A.V. puts our English phrase, but the Hebrew exactly answers to the French <span class="accented">Vive le roi!</span> THE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY UPON SAUL'S ELECTION (vers. 25-27).

Here, however, it is not used for rights so exercised as to become wrongs, but in a good sense, for what we should call a <span class="accented">constitution.</span> The heathen kings were despots, subject to no higher law, and Samuel, in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-18</a>, speaks with merited abhorrence of their violation of the natural rights of their subjects; but under the theocracy the king's power was limited by laws which protected, in the enjoyment of their privileges, the people, the priests, and the prophets. The latter class especially, as being the mouthpiece of Jehovah, formed a powerful check upon the development of despotic tendencies. In sketching Saul's kingly rights Samuel would be guided by <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, and would give the king his true position as the representative of Jehovah both in all matters of internal administration and of war. <span class="cmt_word">And laid it up before Jehovah.</span> Probably by the side of the ark. We are not to suppose that Samuel wrote this at Mizpah. He would fully explain to Saul and the people there what a theocratic king ought to be, and would afterwards draw up a formal document both as a memorial of what had been done, and for the use of future sovereigns, and place it within the sanctuary. It is noteworthy that this is the first notice of writing since the days of the illustrious scribe Eleazar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - Saul did not at once enter upon his duties, but <span class="cmt_word">went home to Gibeah, and there went with him,</span> not <span class="cmt_word">a band of men</span>, but <span class="accented">the host</span>, or <span class="accented">the force, i.e.</span> those brave men <span class="cmt_word">whose hearts God had touched.</span> Whatever was noble and valiant accompanied him, to take counsel for the nation's good; <span class="cmt_word">but the children of Belial,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worthless, good for nothing creatures (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-16.htm">1 Samuel 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>), <span class="cmt_word">despised him.</span> In the A.V. the antithesis between <span class="accented">the force</span>, the strength and bravery that went with Saul, and the <span class="accented">worthlessness</span> which rejected him, is lost by the mistranslation of both words. The Septuagint, on the contrary, strengthens it by rendering "sons of strength" and "pestilent sons." As there was a garrison in the district of Gibeah, this proceeding was likely to embroil Saul with the Philistines, and probably was so intended. They <span class="cmt_word">brought him no presents</span>. Apparently, therefore, the people did bring him presents; and as these would chiefly consist of food, they would be useful only for maintaining a body  of men. This, too, would scarcely escape the notice of so watchful an enemy, and yet until Saul smote one of their garrisons they did nothing; but then, forthwith, they invaded Israel so promptly, and with such overwhelming numbers, as seems to prove that they had been busily making preparations meanwhile to maintain their empire. <span class="cmt_word">He held his peace.</span> Literally, "was as one that is deaf." Had Saul not controlled his anger, a civil war would have been the result, and the lordly tribes of Ephraim and Judah might have refused a king chosen from the little tribe of Benjamin. In fact, Judah never does seem to have given a hearty allegiance to Saul. The Septuagint, followed by Josephus, offers a not improbable different reading, which involves but a very slight change in the Hebrew. Uniting the words with the next chapter, they translate, "And it came to pass, after about a month, that Nahash the Ammonite," etc. The Vulgate has both readings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
