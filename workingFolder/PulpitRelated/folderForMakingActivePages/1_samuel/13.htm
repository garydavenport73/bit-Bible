This verse literally translated is, "Saul was one year old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years over Israel." In its form it exactly follows the usual statement prefixed to each king's reign, of his age at his accession, and the years of his kingdom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>, etc.). The rendering of the A.V. is too forced and untenable to be worth discussing. As we have seen before, the numerals in the Books of Samuel are not trustworthy; but the difficulty here is an old one. The Vulgate translates the Hebrew literally, as we have given it; the Septuagint omits the verse, and the Syriac paraphrases as boldly as the A.V.: "When Saul had reigned one or two years." The Chaldee renders, "Saul was as innocent as a one-year-old child when he began to reign." In the Hexaplar version some anonymous writer has inserted the word <span class="accented">thirty</span>, rashly enough; for as Jonathan was old enough to have an important command (ver. 2), and was capable of the acts of a strong man (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-14.htm">1 Samuel 14:14</a>), his father's age must have been at least thirty-five, and perhaps was even more. As regards the length of Saul's reign, St. Paul makes it forty years (<a href="../../par/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21</a>), exactly the same as that of David (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) and of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-42.htm">1 Kings 11:42</a>); and Josephus testifies that such was the traditional belief of the Jews ('Antiq.,' 6:14, 9). On the other hand, it is remarkable that the word here for <span class="accented">years</span> is that used where the whole number is less than ten. The events, however, recorded in the rest of the book seem to require a longer period than ten years for the duration of Saul's reign; thirty-two would be a more probable number, and, added to the seven and a half years' reign of Ishbosheth (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>), they would make up the whole sum of forty years ascribed by St. Paul to Saul's dynasty. It is quite possible, however, that these forty years may even include the fifteen or sixteen years of Samuel's judgeship. But the two facts, that all the three sons of Saul mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49</a> were old enough to go with him to the battle of Mount Gilboa, where they were slain; and that Ishbosheth, his successor, was forty years of age when his father died, effectually dispose of the idea that Saul's was a very short reign. OCCASION OF THE FIRST WAR AGAINST THE PHILISTINES (vers. 2-7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">Saul chose him three thousand <i>men</i> of Israel; <i>whereof</i> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul chose him.</span> Literally, "And Saul chose him," the usual way of commencing the narrative of a king's reign. He probably selected these 3000 men at the end of the war with the Ammonites, to strengthen the small bodyguard which he had gathered round him at Gibeah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>). As being always in arms, they would become highly disciplined, and form the nucleus and centre of all future military operations (see on 1 Samuel 14:52). He stationed these on either side of the defile in the mountain range of Bethel, so exactly described in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>, where Sennacherib, as we read, leaves his carriage, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his baggage, at Michmash, and after defiling through the pass, arrives at Geba. Gibeah, where Jonathan was posted with 1000 of these picked warriors, was Saul's home, and his son would have the benefit there of the aid of Kish and Abner, while Michmash was the more exposed place, situate about seven miles northeast of Jerusalem. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:110) describes this defile as "a narrow gorge with vertical precipices some 800 feet high - a great crack or fissure in the country, which is peculiar in this respect, that you only become aware of its existence when close to the brink; for on the north the narrow spur of hills hides it, and on the south a flat plateau extends to the top of the crags. On the south side of this great chasm stands Geba of Benjamin, on a rocky knoll, with caverns beneath the houses, and arable land to the east; and on the opposite side, considerably lower than Geba, is the little village of Michmash, on a sort of saddle, backed by an open and fertile corn valley. This valley was famous for producing excellent barley. <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his tent.</span> This with us would be a warlike phrase; but as the mass of the Israelites then dwelt in tents,  it means simply their dispersion homewards; and so the Syriac translates, "He dismissed them each to his house" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <i>was</i> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <i>of it</i>. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In Geba.</span> By this garrison the Philistines commanded the further end of the defile, and they had also another outpost beyond it near Gibeah itself (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). Probably neither of these garrisons was very strong, and Saul may have intended that Jonathan should attack them while he held the northern end of the pass, which would be the first place assailed by the Philistines in force. As regards the word translated <span class="accented">garrison</span>, attempts have been made to render it <span class="accented">pillar</span>, and to represent it as a token of Philistine supremacy which Jonathan threw down, while others, with the Septuagint, take it as a proper name; but the word <span class="accented">smote</span> is strongly in favour of the rendering of the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Let the Hebrews hear.</span> Saul must have intended war when he thus posted himself and Jonathan in such commanding spots, and probably all this had been sketched out by Samuel (see on 1 Samuel 10:8). He now summons all Israel to the war. It is strange that he should call the people "Hebrews," the Philistine title of contempt; but it is used again in ver. 7, and of course in ver. 19. The Septuagint reads, "Let the slaves revolt," but though followed by Josephus, the change of text is not probable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-4.htm">1 Samuel 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">And all Israel heard say <i>that</i> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and <i>that</i> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines.

Saul, therefore, knowing that they were collecting their forces, does the same, <span class="cmt_word">and the people were called together after Saul.</span> Literally, "were cried after him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were summoned by proclamation (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>, where see margin). For <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal</span> see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>. This place had been selected because, as the valley opens there into the plain of Jordan it was a fit spot for the assembling of a large host. For its identification see Conder, 'Tent Work,' 2:7-12. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <i>is</i> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Long before Saul could gather Israel the Philistines had completed their preparations, and invaded the country in overwhelming numbers; but <span class="cmt_word">thirty thousand chariots</span> compared with <span class="cmt_word">six thousand horsemen</span> is out of all proportion. Possibly the final <span class="accented">l</span> in Israel has been taken by some copyists for a numeral, and as it signifies thirty, it his changed 1000 into 30,000. Or, simpler still, <span class="accented">shin</span>, the numeral for 300, has been read with two dots, and so changed into 30,000. <span class="cmt_word">They came up, and pitched in Michmash.</span> Saul had withdrawn eastward to Gilgal, and the Philistines had thus placed themselves between him and Jonathan. There is a difficulty, however, in the words <span class="cmt_word">eastward from Beth-aven;</span> for as this, again, was east of Bethel, it puts the Philistines' camp too much to the east. As it is not, however, the regular phrase for eastward, some commentators render, "in front of Beth-avon." "It means 'the house of naught,' and was the name originally given to the desert east of Bethel, because of its barren character" (Conder, 'Tent Work,' 2:108). The Philistines, however, had come in such numbers that their camp must have occupied a large extent of ground. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people were distressed.</span> Literally, were squeezed, pressed together, were in difficulties. The Philistines had so promptly answered Saul's challenge, that the Israelites, forgetting their victory over Nahash, whose men, however, had probably very inferior arms to those worn by the Philistines, lost courage; and even the picked band of 2000 men dwindled to 600. As for the mass of the people, they acted with the most abject cowardice, hiding themselves in <span class="cmt_word">caves</span>, of which there are very many in the limestone ranges of Palestine. David subsequently found safety in them when hunted by Saul. Also <span class="cmt_word">in thickets.</span> The word as spelt here occurs nowhere else, nor do the versions agree as to its meaning. Most probably it signifies <span class="accented">clefts</span>, rifts or fissures in the <span class="cmt_word">rocks</span>. The next word, rocks, certainly means precipitous <span class="accented">cliffs</span>; and thickets or thorn bushes would scarcely be placed between caverns and cliffs, both of which belong to mountains. <span class="cmt_word">In high places.</span> This word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46, 49</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">hold.</span> But this meaning is not supported by the ancient versions, and it more probably signifies a vault or crypt, which better suits the hiding place next mentioned, <span class="cmt_word">pits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> tanks, artificial reservoirs for water, with which most districts were well supplied in Palestine, even before its conquest by Israel. They were absolutely necessary, as the rains fall only at stated periods, and the chalky soil will not hold water; when dry they would form fit places for concealment.

SAUL'S RASH SACRIFICE (Vers. 8-14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <i>had appointed</i>: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven days, according, to the set time.</span> See on 1 Samuel 10:8. The lapse of time between Samuel's appointment of the seven days during which Saul was to wait for him to inaugurate the war of independence, and the present occasion, was probably not so great as many commentators suppose; for <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a> is, as we have seen, wrongly translated, and everything else leads to the conclusion that the defeat of the Ammonites, the choice of the 3000, and Jonathan's attack on the garrison at Geba followed rapidly upon one another. As the Philistines would rightly regard Israel's choice of a king as an act of rebellion, we cannot suppose them to have been so supine and negligent as not at once to have prepared for war. <span class="cmt_word">Had appointed.</span> The Hebrew word for this has been omitted by some accident. It is given in the Septuagint and Chaldee and some MSS. The whole importance of the occurence arose out of its having been appointed by Samuel on his selection of Saul as king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A burnt offering,</span> etc. The Hebrew has the definite article, <span class="accented">the burnt offering and the peace offerings</span>, which were there ready for Samuel to offer. <span class="cmt_word">He offered.</span> Not with his own hand, but by the hand of the attendant priest, Ahiah, who was, we know, with him. Possibly, nevertheless, the Levitical law was not at this period strictly observed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-10.htm">1 Samuel 13:10</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he might salute him.</span> Literally, "bless him," but the word is often used of a solemn salutation (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>). It is evident that Samuel came on the seventh day, and that Saul in his impetuosity could not stay the whole day out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Samuel said, What hast thou done?

Each day's delay made his small force dwindle rapidly away, and the Philistines might at any hour move down from Michmash upon him at Gilgal and destroy him. But it was the reality of the danger which put his faith and obedience to the trial. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-12.htm">1 Samuel 13:12</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not made supplication unto Jehovah.</span> Literally, "I have not stroked the face of Jehovah," but used of making him propitious by prayer (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-19.htm">Jeremiah 26:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I forced myself.</span> Saul pleads in his justification the imminence of the danger, and perhaps there are few who have faith enough to "stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast done foolishly.</span> Saul had not only received an express command to wait seven days, but it had been given him under special circumstances, and confirmed by the fulfilment of the appointed signs. He knew, moreover, how much depended upon his waiting, and that obedience to the prophet's command was an essential condition of his appointment. Nevertheless, in his impatience and distrust of Jehovah, he cannot bide the set time; not really because of any wish to propitiate God, but because of the effect to be produced upon the mind of the people. It was tedious to remain inactive; his position in the plains was. untenable; at any moment his retreat to the mountains might be cut off; and so he prefers the part of a prudent general to that of an obedient and trustful servant of God. And we may notice that there is no confession of wrong on his part. His mind rather seems entirely occupied with his duty as a king, without having regard to the higher King, whom it ought to have been his first duty to obey. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a></div><div class="verse">But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him <i>to be</i> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <i>that</i> which the LORD commanded thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart.</span> The language of prophecy constantly describes that as already done which is but just determined upon. As David was but twenty-three years of age at Saul's death, he must now have been a mere child, even if he was born, (see ver. 1). But the Divine choice of Saul, which upon his obedience would that day have been confirmed, was now annulled, and the succession transferred elsewhere. Years might elapse before the first earthly step was taken to appoint his successor (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); nay, had Saul repented, we gather from <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a> that he might have been forgiven: for God's threatenings, like his promises, are conditional. There is no fatalism in the Bible, but a loving discipline for man's recovery. But behind it stands the Divine foreknowledge and omnipotence; and so to the prophetic view Saul's refusal to repent, his repeated disobedience, and the succession of David were all revealed as accomplished facts. CONTINUANCE OF THE WAR (vers. 15-18). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-15.htm">1 Samuel 13:15</a></div><div class="verse">And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.

Even if this be not so, yet friendly relations must have continued between Saul and Samuel, as the latter would otherwise certainly not have chosen Saul's home for his halting place; nor would he go thither without seeing Jonathan, and giving him aid and counsel. Saul numbered. See on 1 Samuel 11:8. After summoning the whole nation there did not remain with him even as many as a third of his selected band.

Our translators no doubt considered that as <span class="accented">Gibeah of Benjamin</span> occurs in the previous verse, this must be the same place. But our greater knowledge of the geography of the Holy Land enables us to say that Geba is right; for, as we have seen, it was at one end of the defile, at the other end of which was Michmash; and here alone could the small army of Saul have any chance of defending itself against the vast host of the Philistines. However much we may blame Saul's disobedience, he was a skilful soldier and a brave man, and his going with his little band to the end of the pass to make a last desperate stand was an act worthy of a king.

But they despised them both, and regarding the country as conquered, proceed to punish it, as probably they had cone on previous occasions, when no one had dared to make resistance. Leaving then the main army to guard the camp at Michmash, they sent out light armed troops to plunder the whole land. <span class="cmt_word">One company turned unto the way...  to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual.</span> This company went northward, towards Ophrah, a place five miles east of Bethel.

But probably this description applies fully only to the districts of Benjamin, near the Philistines, The people further away had arms with which they defeated the Ammonites, and Saul and his men would have secured all the weapons which the enemy then threw away. But evidently no manufacture of weapons was allowed, and no one as far as possible permitted either to wear or possess arms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20</a></div><div class="verse">But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Israelites went down to the Philistines.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to their land. This could only have applied to the districts near the Philistines, unless we suppose that they set up forges also at their garrisons. <span class="cmt_word">To sharpen.</span> The verb chiefly refers to such work as required an anvil and hammer. As regards the implements, not only do the versions disagree in their renderings, but the Septuagint has a very curious different reading, to the effect that at harvest time the Israelites had to pay the Philistines three shekels for repairing and whetting their tools. The <span class="cmt_word">share</span> is more probably a <span class="accented">sickle.</span> The <span class="cmt_word">coulter</span> is certainly a <span class="accented">ploughshare</span>, as rendered in <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>. Of the <span class="cmt_word">ax</span> there is no doubt; and the <span class="cmt_word">mattock</span> is a heavy hoe for turning up the ground, as spades for that purpose are scarcely anywhere used, except in our own country. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a></div><div class="verse">Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A file.</span> Margin, <span class="accented">a file with mouths.</span> The word only occurs here, and is translated a file on the authority of Rashi. Almost all modern commentators agree that it means <span class="accented">bluntness</span>, and that this verse should be joined on to the preceding, and the two be translated, "But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his sickle, and his ploughshare, and his axe, and his mattock, whenever the edges of the mattocks, and the ploughshares, and the forks, and the axes were blunt, and also to set (so the margin rightly) the goads." The Israelites were thus in a state of complete dependence upon the Philistines, even for carrying on their agriculture, and probably retained only the hill country, while their enemies were masters of the plains. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a></div><div class="verse">So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was neither sword,</span> etc. Armed only with clubs and their farming implements, it is no wonder that the people were afraid of fighting the Philistines, who, as we gather from the description of Goliath's armour, were clad in mail; nor is it surprising that they despised and neglected Saul and his few men, whom probably they regarded as an unarmed mob of rustics. The Ammonites probably were far less efficiently armed than the Philistines, who, as commanding the sea coast, could import weapons from Greece. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23</a></div><div class="verse">And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the garrison,</span> etc. When the Philistines heard that Saul with his six hundred men had joined the small force already at Geba with Jonathan, they sent a body of men to occupy an eminence higher up in the defile which lay between Geba and Michmash (see on 1 Samuel 13:2). The  purpose of this was to keep the route open, that so, when they pleased, they might send a larger body of troops up the defile in order to attack Saul. It would also keep a watch upon his movements, though they could have had no expectation that he would venture to attack them. It was this garrison which Jonathan so bravely attacked, and by his success prepared the way for the utter defeat of the enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_samuel/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Samuel 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_samuel/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Samuel 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
