The family documents were no doubt kept in full, but when transcribed, as here and in the First Book of Chronicles, only a summary is given, and as the omitted links are not always the same, great difficulty is necessarily the result. The most satisfactory genealogy is that given by Schaff from a comparison of <a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35-39</a>, and is as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Benjamin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Becher; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Aphish, perhaps same as Abiah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Bechorath; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Zeror, or Zur; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> Abiel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> Ner; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> Kish; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> Saul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Very many links, however, are omitted, among whom must be placed Matri, mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-21.htm">1 Samuel 10:21</a>; and Jehiel, mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a> (and see <span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:29). He is described as the first settler and coloniser of Gibeon, and as husband of Maachah, a daughter or granddaughter of Caleb. The spelling of his name with an <span class="accented">ain</span> forbids our confounding him with Abiel, as is done by Schaff and most commentators, and whom, apparently, he preceded by many generations. In the two places referred to above a large family of sons is ascribed to him; but as, first of all, the lists do not agree, as, moreover, they are said to dwell with their brethren in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a>), and as Ner, the father of Kish, is mentioned in the second list, it is pretty certain that we are not to regard, them as his actual children, but as the leading names among his posterity. The fearful cruelty recorded in <a href="../../par/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a> may well account for the hopeless entanglement of Benjamite genealogies. An ancestor of Saul must, of course, have been among the 600 who escaped to the rock Rimmon, but he could have saved only his own life. <span class="cmt_word">A mighty man of power</span>. Really, "of wealth." Saul, like David afterwards, was sprung from an affluent family, whose landed property was situated at Gibeah, about four miles north of Jerusalem, afterwards known as Gibeah of Saul. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he had a son, whose name <i>was</i> Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and <i>there was</i> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward <i>he was</i> higher than any of the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He had a son, whose name was Saul.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> <span class="accented">asked</span>, a name usually given to a firstborn son. <span class="cmt_word">A choice young man.</span> This is a double translation of the Hebrew word, and consequently one half or other must be wrong. It may either be a participle, <span class="accented">elect</span> or <span class="accented">choice</span>, and is so rendered by the Syriac and Vulgate; or an adjective, <span class="accented">young</span>, the rendering of the Chaldee, and virtually of the Septuagint, which gives <span class="accented">well grown.</span> This is the preferable translation; for the word constantly occurs coupled with virgin (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>, etc.), for one in the full flower of manhood. Saul could not, therefore, have been the runner of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a>, though, as we read that Jonathan his son was a grown man two or three years afterwards (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>), he must have been at least thirty-five years of age, after making allowance for the early period at which the Jews married. His noble appearance and gigantic stature were well fitted to impress and overawe a semi-barbarous people, who were better able to form an estimate of his physical qualities than of the high mental and moral gifts possessed by Samuel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-3.htm">1 Samuel 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The asses of Kish...were lost.</span> So strangely is the trivial ever united with events most solemn and weighty, that Saul set out upon this journey, in which he was to find a kingdom, with no other object than to look for some lost asses - Hebrew, "she-asses." As used for riding (<a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>), the ass was valuable, and as these were probably kept for breeding, they were allowed more liberty than the males, and so strayed away. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found <i>them</i> not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and <i>there they were</i> not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found <i>them</i> not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mount Ephraim.</span> Though Gibeah, Saul's home, was in Benjamin, it was situated on this long mountain range (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land of Shalisha.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> <span class="accented">Three-land</span>, and probably, therefore, the region round Baal-shalisha. It takes its name from the three valleys which there converge in the great Wady Kurawa, <span class="cmt_word">The land of Shalim.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> of jackals; probably the same as the land of Shual, also   =   jackal-land (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a>). The very name shows that it was a wild, uninhabited region. The derivation <span class="accented">hollow-land</span> is untenable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that <i>was</i> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave <i>caring</i> for the asses, and take thought for us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land of Zuph.</span> See on 1 Samuel 1:1. This Levite ancestor of Samuel had probably occupied and colonised this district after the disasters recorded in the last chapters of the Book of Judges. <span class="cmt_word">Lest my father,</span> etc. A mark of good feeling on Saul's part, and a proof of the affectionate terms on which Kish and his family lived. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto him, Behold now, <i>there is</i> in this city a man of God, and <i>he is</i> an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this city.</span> Probably Ramathaim-zophim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Ramah, Samuel's dwelling place and property. Confessedly, however, Saul's route hither and thither in search of lost cattle is very obscure, and it is difficult to reconcile this identification with the statement in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, that Rachel's sepulchre lay on the route between this city and Gibeah of Saul. Nevertheless, Ramah was certainly in the land of Zuph, whence too it took its longer name (see on 1 Samuel 1:1); and it is remarkable that Jeremiah  (1 Samuel 31:15) describes Rachel's weeping as being heard in Ramah. It seems extraordinary that Saul should have known nothing of Israel's chief ruler, and that his servant was acquainted with him only in his lower capacity as a person to be consulted in private difficulties. He describes him, nevertheless, as <span class="cmt_word">an honourable man,</span> or, more literally, an honoured man, one held in honour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, <i>if</i> we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and <i>there is</i> not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bread is spent in our vessels.</span> In the East a great man is always approached with a present, and offerings of food were no doubt the most usual gifts (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>). Those made to the false prophets are contemptuously described in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a> as "handfuls of barley and pieces of bread." <span class="cmt_word">A present.</span> The word is rare, and apparently is the technical name for a fee of this kind, half payment and half gift. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-8.htm">1 Samuel 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: <i>that</i> will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fourth part of a shekel.</span> Apparently the shekel, roughly stamped, was divided into four quarters by a cross, and broken when needed. What was its proportionate value in Samuel's days we cannot tell, for silver was rare; but in size it would be somewhat bigger than a sixpence, and would be a very large fee, while the bread would have been a small one. It very well marks the eagerness of the servant that he is ready to part with the considerable sum of money in his possession in order to consult the seer. The whole conversation is given in a very lively and natural manner. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for <i>he that is</i> now <i>called</i> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beforetime,</span> etc. This verse is evidently a gloss, written originally by some later hand in the margin, in order to explain the word used for seer in vers. 11, 18, 19. Inserted here in the text it interrupts the narrative, and is itself somewhat incomprehensible. The Septuagint offers a very probable reading, namely, "for the people in old time used to call the prophet a seer," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it was a word used chiefly by the common people. Prophet, <span class="accented">nabi</span>, is really the older and established word from the beginning of the Old Testament to the end. The word <span class="accented">roeh</span>, used in this place for seer, is comparatively rare, as a popular word would be in written compositions. It refers to that which is seen by the ordinary sight, to waking vision (see on 1 Samuel 3:1, 10), whereas the other word for seer, <span class="accented">chozeh</span>, refers to ecstatic vision. <span class="accented">Roeh</span> is used by Isaiah, ch. Isaiah 30:10, apparently in much the same sense as here, of those whom the people consulted in their difficulties, and they might be true prophets as Samuel was, or mere pretenders to occult powers. The present narrative makes it plain that <span class="accented">roeh</span> was used in a good sense in Samuel's days; but gradually it became degraded, and while <span class="accented">chozeh</span> became the respectful word for a prophet, <span class="accented">roeh</span> became the contrary. Another conclusion also follows. We have seen that there are various indications that the Books of Samuel in their present state are later than his days. Here, on the contrary, we have a narrative couched in the very language of his times; for the writer of the gloss contained in this verse was displeased at Samuel being called a <span class="accented">roeh</span>, but did not dare to alter it, though taking care to note that it was equivalent in those days to calling him a <span class="accented">nabi.</span>

As, then, <span class="accented">they go up the ascent</span> - so the Hebrew, literally  - they meet maidens on the way to the well, and ask them, <span class="cmt_word">Is the seer</span> - the <span class="accented">roeh</span> - <span class="cmt_word">here?</span> They answer, Yes; <span class="cmt_word">behold, he is before you</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> they are to go straightforward, and farther on in the town they will find him. <span class="cmt_word">He came today to the city.</span> As Saul's servant knew that this city was Samuel's abode, the words must mean that he had just returned from visiting one of those places, probably, to which he was in the habit of going as judge. From <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2</a> we learn that Samuel went occasionally even to distant places to perform priestly duties. <span class="cmt_word">In the high place.</span> Hebrew, Bamah. Samuel, we read, had built an altar at Ramah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>), and probably the present sacrifice was to be offered upon it. Such altars, and the worship of the true God upon high places, were at this time recognised as right, and were, in fact, in accordance with, and were even the remains of, the old patriarchal religion. But gradually they were condemned, partly because of the glowing sanctity of the temple, but chiefly because of the tendency of religious rites celebrated in such places to degenerate into nature-worship, and orgies such as the heathen were in the habit of holding on the tops of mountains and hills. We thus find in the Bible an illustration of the principle that rites and ceremonies (as not being of the essentials of religion) may be changed, or even abolished, if they are abused, or lead on to evil consequences. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a></div><div class="verse">And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <i>he is</i> before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for <i>there is</i> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:</div><div class="comm">

The latter word should be omitted, as they simply say that on entering the city Saul and his servant would easily find Samuel; for he would not go up to the feast till all was ready, nor would the people begin till he had arrived, because it was his office to bless the sacrificial banquet. The pious custom of asking a blessing on meals, our Lord's "giving of thanks," is inherited by us from the Jews. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-14.htm">1 Samuel 9:14</a></div><div class="verse">And they went up into the city: <i>and</i> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they were come into.</span> More correctly, "As they were going into the city." This agrees with what is said in ver. 18, that Saul and Samuel met in the  gateway. As Ramah occupied two hills, the Bamah would be on the summit of one, while the city probably nestled between them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-15.htm">1 Samuel 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Jehovah had told Samuel in his ear.</span> Literally, "had uncovered his ear," as in <a href="../../par/ruth/4-4.htm">Ruth 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-27.htm">2 Samuel 7:27</a>. The phrase is taken from the pushing aside of the headdress in order to whisper, and therefore means that Jehovah had secretly told Samuel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a></div><div class="verse">To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <i>to be</i> captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> Though Samuel had lightened the yoke of the Philistines by his victory at Mizpah, yet he had by no means altogether broken their power. It is so constantly the habit of the historical books of the Bible to include the distant and ultimate results of an act in their account of it, that we must not conclude that what is said in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13-15</a> was the immediate consequence of Samuel's victory. Especially, when it said that "the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel," it is plain that Soul's successful wars are included in the writer's summary of events, inasmuch as Samuel's life was prolonged until nearly the close of that monarch's reign. The words further show that Soul's office was essentially military, though this is too much emphasised in the A.V., which renders by <span class="cmt_word">captain</span> a word which really means <span class="accented">prince, chief.</span> Saul, as a Benjamite, belonged to the bravest and most warlike tribe of Israel, and one whose country was the seat of perpetual combat with the Philistines. <span class="cmt_word">Their cry is come unto me.</span> Plainly, therefore, Israel was again suffering from Philistine domination. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-17.htm">1 Samuel 9:17</a></div><div class="verse">And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah said unto him.</span> Literally, "Jehovah answered him." When Samuel saw the young stranger, struck by his towering height, he wondered within himself whether this were the destined hero who was to win freedom for Israel. The affirmation, therefore, came in answer to the question asked by his heart. <span class="cmt_word">The same shall reign over my people.</span> More literally, the margin, "restrain in," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> coerce, control. The A.V., preferring as usual a general to an exact rendering, loses this plain indication that Soul's would be a strict and stern rule.

The contradiction which many commentators suppose that they find between the two verses arises from their not remembering that prepositions constantly lose their original meaning. Literally the preposition means <span class="accented">in the middle</span>, but its common meaning is simply <span class="accented">within.</span> So with <span class="accented">us immediately</span> has lost all reference to the middle, though derived from that word, and signifies <span class="accented">directly, at once.</span> Saul, then, and his servant were just going (it is a present participle) <span class="accented">within</span> the city when they meet Samuel coming out, and accost him in the very portal.

So, too, the information that the asses were found, given to him before he had even hinted at the object of his visit, would convince him of the reality of Samuel's prophetic powers. <span class="cmt_word">On whom is all the desire of Israel?</span> Rather, "To whom belongs all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for thy father's house?" The words were intended to indicate to Saul, though in an obscure manner, that the supreme power in Israel would be his. Why trouble about she-asses? They might be beautiful, and a valuable property for a husbandman;but he was about to become a king, to whom would belong everything that was best and most precious.

Benjamin, already the smallest tribe, had been so crushed that its power must have been very small, and Soul's house, though opulent, was not a leading one; how then could one of its members expect so high a dignity? For <span class="cmt_word">families of the tribe of Benjamin</span> the Hebrew has "tribes," probably owing to some confusion with the words "tribes of Israel" just before. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a></div><div class="verse">And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <i>were</i> about thirty persons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into the parlour</span>. Strictly the cell or room attached to the chapel of the high place, now used as the <span class="accented">guest chamber</span>, wherein the thirty chief men, who came as invited guests, were to dine. The rest of the people would be in the open air. There Samuel not only placed Saul in the seat of honour, but also his servant, as representing the king's officers of state, and commanded the cook to set before him a <span class="cmt_word">portion</span> that had been reserved. This was the shoulder; but whether it was the left shoulder, of which the laity might eat, or the right shoulder, which was sacred, as belonging to the priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>), is not mentioned. If the latter, it was Samuel s own share, and he may by his prophetic authority have assigned it to Saul, in token that the priesthood would be subject to the royal power. Be this, however, as it may, it was the portion of honour, and it seems that Samuel, on receiving intimation the previous day of Saul's visit (ver. 6), had given orders  that it should be carefully reserved for him (ver. 24). He now orders it to be set before Saul, with that <span class="cmt_word">which was upon it,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the flesh and the fat not appointed to be burnt upon the altar.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-24.htm">1 Samuel 9:24</a></div><div class="verse">And the cook took up the shoulder, and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> upon it, and set <i>it</i> before Saul. And <i>Samuel</i> said, Behold that which is left! set <i>it</i> before thee, <i>and</i> eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel said.</span> Samuel's name is not given in the Hebrew, and though inserted by the Septuagint and Vulgate, it is so only by a manifest error. The Syriac and Chaldee, like the Hebrew, make the cook the speaker. The right translation is, "And the cook lifted up the shoulder with that which was upon it, and set it before Saul, and said, 'Behold, that which hath been reserved is set (a participle, and not the imperative) before thee; eat, for it hath been kept for thee unto the appointed time of which he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Samuel) spake, saying, I have invited the people. The word translated in the A.V. <span class="accented">since I said</span> is one which means <span class="accented">saying</span>, and nothing else; and as what goes before contains no verb to which <span class="accented">saying</span> can refer, it is plain that there is an ellipse. But if the cook be the speaker, the meaning is plain, as follows: - When on the previous day the revelation was made to Samuel that Israel's future king would present himself on the morrow, the prophet at once made preparations to receive him with due solemnity, and for this purpose arranged a sacrifice, and invited thirty of the chief citizens of Ramah to assemble at the high place, and sit at the banquet with him. And then it was, when telling the cook of his invitation, that he gave orders that the portion of honour should be carefully reserved, to be set at the fittingtime before the stranger. The chat of the cook is entirely after the manner of ancient times, and would show Saul how completely his coming had been foreseen and provided for.

Without communicating to Saul that he was to be king, which was not revealed to him till the next day (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), Samuel might be anxious to impress on Saul's mind the great principles of the theocratic government, and also the nature of the remedies necessary for Israel's recovery from its present misery. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-26.htm">1 Samuel 9:26</a></div><div class="verse">And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away.

Saul had slept there, and, wearied out with his long wanderings and the excitement of the previous day, was fast asleep when Samuel came to him. The Hebrew is, "And they rose early; for at the spring of the day Samuel called to Saul upon the house top, saying," etc. And no sooner had Saul risen than they started upon his journey home, and as soon as they had left the city, at some fitting spot, Samuel bade the servant go forward, and as soon as he and Saul were alone he spake unto him <span class="cmt_word">the word of God.</span> And by that Divine word he who had left his father's house in search of lost asses was summoned to a post which, if one of the greatest dignity, was full also of danger, and burdened with solemn responsibility. And while on the human side Saul proved not unworthy of a royal crown, in his relation towards God he failed, because he let self-will and earthly policy prevail in his heart over obedience and trust in God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
