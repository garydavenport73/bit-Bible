But as he had gone first to Gath, where no doubt Achish collected his vassals, and then marched northwards with the army for two days, he must altogether have been absent from Ziklag for some little time. <span class="cmt_word">The Amalelkites.</span> Doubtless they were glad to retaliate upon David for his cruel treatment of them; but, besides, they lived by rapine, and when the fighting men of Philistia and of Judaea were marching away to war, it was just the opportunity which they wished of spoiling the defenceless country. <span class="cmt_word">The south.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the Negeb, for which see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>. It was the name especially given to the southern district of Judah, whence these freebooters turned westward towards Ziklag. They would probably not dare to penetrate far into either territory. The word for <span class="cmt_word">invaded</span> is the same as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>, and implies that they spread themselves over the country to drive off cattle and booty, but with no intention of fighting battles.

It was probably for thus leaving their wives and families absolutely defenceless that David's people were so angry with him. As we are told in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a> that the refugees with David had brought each his household with him into the Philistine territory, the number of women must have been large. The Amalekites spared their lives, not because they were more merciful than David, but because women and children were valuable as slaves. All the best would be picked out, and sent probably to Egypt for sale.

Their great sorrow is pathetically described in ver. 4. But, as is often the case with those in distress, from grief they turned to anger, and sought relief for their feelings by venting their rage upon the innocent.

In strong contrast to the silence which surrounds Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>), the answer is most encouraging. Literally it is, "Pursue; for overtaking thou shalt overtake, and delivering thou shalt deliver."

So rapid was his march that one third of these dropped out of the ranks, so that the newcomers from Manasseh would have been useless, nor had they lost wives or children. The <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> (or rather "torrent") <span class="cmt_word">Besor</span> practically remains unidentified, as the site of Ziklag is unknown; but possibly it is the Wady-es-Sheriah, which runs into the sea a little to the south of Gaza. As there was water here, <span class="cmt_word">those that were left behind stayed.</span> Hebrew, "the stragglers stayed." It seems also to have been wide enough to cause some difficulty in crossing, as it is said that these 200 were too faint, or tired, <span class="cmt_word">to go over the</span> torrent <span class="cmt_word">Besor</span>. From ver. 24 we find that David also left with them as much as possible of his baggage. Stragglers had no doubt been falling out for some time, but would here be rallied, and obtain rest and refreshment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-10.htm">1 Samuel 30:10</a></div><div class="verse">But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</div><div class="comm">

He had become faint and could not travel as fast as they did, and so was left behind with no supplies of food, for he had eaten nothing <span class="cmt_word">for three days and three nights</span>. The Amalekites had thus a start of at least this time, or even more, as this slave would probably have carried some food away with him from Ziklag.

He learns from him besides that he was left behind three days ago because he <span class="cmt_word">fell sick</span>. The word does not imply more than temporary faintness, and is that translated <span class="accented">sorry</span> in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>. But his life was of too little value for them to mount him on a camel, or even to leave with him supplies of food, and so their inhumanity led to their destruction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a></div><div class="verse">We made an invasion <i>upon</i> the south of the Cherethites, and upon <i>the coast</i> which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Cherethites.</span> The interest in this people arises from David's bodyguard having been composed of foreigners bearing  the name of Cherethim and Pelethim. We here find the Cherethim inhabiting the southern portion of the land of the Philistines, and such was still the case in the days of Zephaniah (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>, and compare <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>). As David retained Ziklag (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), he appears to have chosen the men who were to guard his person from this neighbourhood, having probably been struck by their stature and martial bearing when dwelling among them. Hence it is probable that the Pelethim were also a Philistine race. Whether the Cherethim and the Philistines generally came from Crete to Palestine is a very disputed question, but they were certainly not indigenous, but immigrants into Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">Caleb</span>. Upon the settlement of the Israelites in Canaan, Hebron with a large district in the south of Judah was assigned to Caleb the Kenezite, who with his clan had been incorporated into the tribe of Judah. Though the town was afterwards assigned to the priests, the whole country round remained subject to Caleb (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-11.htm">Joshua 21:11, 12</a>), and continued to bear his name. Evidently the Amalekites, beginning on the east, had swept the whole southern district of Judah before entering the country of the Philistines, where they no doubt burnt Ziklag in revenge for David's cruel treatment of them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-15.htm">1 Samuel 30:15</a></div><div class="verse">And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To this company.</span> Better, "troop." The word signifies a band of soldiers, robbers, or the like. Required by David to act as his guide, the Egyptian consents upon condition that David bind himself neither to kill him, it being one of the unscrupulous customs of ancient warfare to put deserters, persons forced to act as guides, and even noncombatants, to death to save trouble; nor give him up to his master, who would treat him in the same way. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-16.htm">1 Samuel 30:16</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had brought him down, behold, <i>they were</i> spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had brought them down.</span> Though left behind, the Egyptian knew the course which the Amalekites intended to take, and was thus able to bring David quickly up to them, as they would move slowly because of their large booty of cattle. On overtaking them David found them dispersed in scattered groups <span class="cmt_word">abroad upon all the earth</span> (literally, "over the face of all the land"), <span class="cmt_word">eating and drinking, and dancing.</span> More probably, "feasting." The word literally means <span class="accented">keeping festival</span>; but though they had solemn dances at festivals, yet, as is the case with our word <span class="accented">feasting</span>, good eating was probably the uppermost idea; still the word may have only the general sense of "enjoying themselves as on a festival." DEFEAT OF THE AMALEKITES AND RECOVERY OF THE WOMEN AND SPOIL (vers. 17-20). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a></div><div class="verse">And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the twilight</span>. It has been debated whether this means the evening or the morning twilight; but the words which follow, "unto the evening of the next day," literally, "of (or <span class="accented">for</span>) their morrow," seem to prove that it was in the evening that David arrived. Moreover, in the morning they would not have been feasting, but sleeping. David probably attacked them at once, and slew all within reach until nightfall. The next morning the battle was renewed; but as David had but 400 men, and the Amalekites covered a large extent of country, and probably tried to defend themselves and their booty, it was not till towards the next evening that the combat and the pursuit were over. As they would need pasture and water for their cattle, they had evidently broken up into detachments, which had gone each into a different place with their herds. The pursuit must have been prolonged to a considerable distance, as no more than 400 young men escaped, and even they only by the aid of their camels. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-18.htm">1 Samuel 30:18</a></div><div class="verse">And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Recovered</span>. Hebrew, "rescued," or "delivered." The word occurs again in the second clause of the verse, and is there translated "rescued." <span class="cmt_word">Had carried away.</span> Hebrew, "had taken." In ver. 19 <span class="cmt_word">recovered</span> is literally "caused to return," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> restored.

After David, as related in vers. 18, 19, had recovered the cattle carried oft by the Amalekites, he also took all the flocks and herds belonging to them; and his own men "made these go in front of that body of cattle, and said, This is David's spoil," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they presented it to him by acclamation.

The singular is supported by all the versions except the Chaldee, and by some MSS. David had made such men as were growing weary halt at the torrent, because it was a fit place where to collect the stragglers, and also, perhaps, because it would have required time and labour to get the baggage across. All the more wicked and worthless (see on 1 Samuel 1:16) members of the force now propose to give the 200, only their wives and children, and send them away with no share of the spoil. Besides the sheep and oxen given to David, there would be camels and other animals, arms, gold and silver, clothing, and other personal property.

Such were Ira and Gareb, Ithrites from Jattir, Shama and Jehiel from Aroer; perhaps also Zabdi the Shiphmite (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27</a>) came from Siphmoth. We find David in this narrative acting justly as a soldier, generously to those who had been kind to him in his wanderings, and forming friendships which he retained and cherished long afterwards, when from being a fugitive he had become a king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_samuel/29.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Samuel 29"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 29" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_samuel/31.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Samuel 31"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 31" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
