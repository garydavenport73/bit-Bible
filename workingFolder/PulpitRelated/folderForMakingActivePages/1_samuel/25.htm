And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel died.</span> According to Josephus, Samuel had for eighteen years been contemporaneous with Saul's kingdom. If this calculation, which probably rests upon some Jewish tradition, be at all correct, we must include the years of Samuel's judgeship in the sum total of Saul's reign (see on 1 Samuel 13:1), as evidently his fall was now fast approaching. Samuel's life marked the beginning of the second age of Israelite history (<a href="../../par/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>). Moses had given the people their law, but Samuel in the schools of the prophets provided for them that education without which a written law was powerless, and called forth also and regulated that living energy in the prophetic order which, claiming an all but equal authority, modified and developed it, and continually increased its breadth and force, until the last prophet, Jesus of Nazareth, with supreme and Divine power reenacted it as the religion of the whole world. And as neither his educational institutions nor the prophetic order, whose ordinary duties were closely connected with these schools, could have flourished without internal quietness and security, Samuel also established the Jewish monarchy, which was ideally also necessary, because the Messiah must not only be priest and prophet, but before all things a king (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). And side by side with the kingdom he lived on to see the military successes of the first king, and the firm establishment of the royal power; but to witness also the development of that king into a despot, the overclouding of his mind with fits of madness, the designation of his successor, the probation of that successor by manifold trials, his ripening fitness under them to be the model of a theocratic king, and his growth in power so as practically to be now safe from all Saul's evil purposes. And so in the fulness of time Samuel died, and all Israel gathered together and made lamentation for him (see <a href="../../par/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and buried him in his house.</span> The tomb at present shown as that of Samuel is situated upon a lofty hill, the identification of which with Ramah is very uncertain. Probably he was buried not actually in his house, as that would lead to perpetual ceremonial defilement (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>), but in some open spot in his garden (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-20.htm">2 Chronicles 33:20</a>).  So Joab was buried in his own house (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-34.htm">1 Kings 2:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At Ramah.</span> Thenius thinks that the prophets shared with the kings the right of intramural burial. DAVID IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN (vers. 1-42). DAVID ASKS A GIFT OF THE WEALTHY NABAL AND IS REFUSED (vers. 1-13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David arose.</span> This is not to be connected with the death of Samuel, as though David had now lost a protector. But as he had fully 600 men with him, and his force was continually increasing, it was necessary for him to roam over a wide extent of country in order to obtain supplies of food. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness of Paran.</span> Paran strictly is a place in the southernmost part of the peninsula of Arabia, a little to the west of Mount Sinai; but there can be little doubt that it gave its name to the vast extent of pasture and barren land now known as the desert of El-Tih (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>). Of this the wildernesses of Judah and Beersheba would virtually form parts without the borders being strictly defined. We need not therefore read "the wilderness of Maon," with the Septuagint and many commentators. On the contrary, we have seen that the hold in ch. 24:22 was the hill Hachilah in that neighbourhood, and David now moved southward towards the edge of this vast wilderness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>there was</i> a man in Maon, whose possessions <i>were</i> in Carmel; and the man <i>was</i> very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man in Maon.</span> Though strictly by descent belonging to Maon (for which see on 1 Samuel 23:24), his <span class="cmt_word">possessions</span> - rather, "his business," "occupation" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/47-3.htm">Genesis 47:3</a>, and <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>, where it is translated <span class="accented">work</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">were in Carmel,</span> the small town just north of Maon, where Saul set up a trophy at the end of the Amalekite war (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-12.htm">1 Samuel 15:12</a>), and to which Abigail belonged (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>). He is described as <span class="cmt_word">very great</span> because of his wealth arising from his large flocks of sheep and goats, which fed upon the pasture land which forms the elevated plateau of Carmel, where <span class="cmt_word">he was shearing his sheep,</span> usually a time of lavish hospitality (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23, 24</a>).

She, with her bright understanding and beautiful person (the Hebrew word takes in much more than the countenance; see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">comely person</span>), is in contrast with the coarse, churlish man who was her husband. His name was either one which he had acquired by his conduct, or if given him by his parents shows that they were clownish people. <span class="cmt_word">He was of the house of Caleb.</span> The written text has, "he was according to his heart," <span class="accented">celibbo, i.e.</span> a self-willed man, or one whose rude exterior answered to his inner nature; but there are linguistic difficulties in the way of this reading, and the Kri is probably right in correcting <span class="accented">calibbi, a</span> Calebite, a descendant of Caleb, who had large possessions assigned him in the neighbourhood of Hebron (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-19</a>), which is only ten miles northwest of Carmel. The versions support the Kri, though the Syriac and Septuagint render <span class="accented">doglike</span> - one who, like a dog, though he has plenty, yet grudges others. The meaning of the name Caleb is literally "a dog." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-4.htm">1 Samuel 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span>  - Though David had gone some distance southward of Carmel, yet it was worth his while to send men to Nabal's sheep shearing, as the maintenance of his numerous force must have been a continual difficulty. The large number, <span class="cmt_word">ten</span>, also shows that he expected a liberal gift of food. Probably such missions were not uncommon, and the large sheep masters were glad to supply the wants of one who guarded their flocks and defended them from the incursions of the desert tribes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-5.htm">1 Samuel 25:5</a></div><div class="verse">And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</div><div class="comm">

Literally it is, "Ye shall say to him, For life!" Probably it was a colloquial form of greeting, and equivalent to "good luck, "success," <span class="accented">life</span> in Hebrew being sometimes used for prosperity. So Luther translates it, and Rashi and the Babylonian Talmud are also in its favour. The reading of the Vulgate, "To thy brothers" (be peace), is to be altogether rejected. <span class="cmt_word">We hurt them not.</span> Literally, "we caused them no shame" (see <a href="../../par/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>), we did nothing to vex and injure them. Really the words mean that David had protected them, and enabled them to feed their flocks in safety. The fact that David waited till the sheep shearing, when hospitality was the rule, proves that he did not levy blackmail upon his countrymen, though necessarily he must have depended upon them for the food indispensabIe for the support of his men. <span class="cmt_word">A good day.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> a festive day, which should bring us a share in thy prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">Thy son David.</span> A title expressive of the reverence due from the youthful David to his senior, and an acknowledgment of Nabal's superiority over his fugitive neighbour.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who <i>is</i> David? and who <i>is</i> the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There be many servants,</span> etc. Nabal would scarcely have ventured to speak in so insulting a manner if David had been at Maon, but as he had moved with his men a long distance towards the south, he. gave free vent to his rude feelings without restraint. David was to him a mere slave  who had run away from his master, Saul. <span class="cmt_word">My bread,...  my water.</span> These are the necessaries of life, while the flesh was the special luxury provided for the festival. David's ten young men would not literally carry water to him at so great a distance, nor did Nabal mean more than our phrase "meat and drink." The use, nevertheless, of <span class="accented">water</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">drink</span> marks the value of water in the hill country, and also the abstemious habits of the people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-11.htm">1 Samuel 25:11</a></div><div class="verse">Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give <i>it</i> unto men, whom I know not whence they <i>be</i>?</div><div class="comm">

No doubt Nabal's insult irritated him, and possibly also the rude outlaws round him would have protested against any other course; but Nabal's words, rude though they were, would not justify David in the rough vengeance which he meditated. Abigail throughout her speech argues that David was taking too violent a course, and one for which he would afterwards have been sorry. ABIGAIL PACIFIES DAVID (vers. 14-35).

The first of these affirmations is obscured by the rendering in the A.V., and should be translated, "And now, my lord (an ordinary title of respect, like our <span class="accented">sir</span>), as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, so true is it that Jehovah hath withholden thee from blood guiltiness, and from saving thyself with thine own hand; and now let thine enemies," etc. The same words recur in vers. 31, 33. <span class="cmt_word">Blessing</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> gift, present (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>).

Her prayer rests on the ground that she was saving David from a sin, and that in his thirst for vengeance he was bringing upon himself guilt.

It was Saul's business at present to fight "Jehovah's battles," either in person or by his officers (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>). The words, therefore, distinctly look forward to the time when David as king will have the duty imposed upon him of protecting Jehovah's covenant people. <span class="cmt_word">Evil hath not been found in thee.</span> Hebrew, "shall not be found in thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the time comes for thee to take the kingdom no one shall be able to allege against thee any offence by which thou hast lost thy title to the kingly office; nor afterwards as king shalt thou be guilty of any breach of thy duty to Jehovah, Israel's supreme Ruler, so as to incur rejection as Saul has done. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a></div><div class="verse">Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, <i>as out</i> of the middle of a sling.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet a man is risen.</span> Rather, "And should any one arise to pursue thee," etc. The reference is of course to Saul, but put with due reserve, and also made general, so as to include all possible injury attempted against David. <span class="cmt_word">Bound in the bundle of life.</span> Hebrew, "of the living." The metaphor is taken from the habit of packing up in a bundle articles of great value or of indispensable use, so that the owner may carry them about his person. In India the phrase is common; thus, a just judge is said to be bound up in the bundle of righteousness; a lover in the bundle of love. Abigail prays, therefore, that David may, with others whose life is precious in God's sight, be securely kept under Jehovah's personal care and protection. In modern times the two words signifying "in the bundle of the living" form a common inscription on Jewish gravestones, the phrase having been interpreted in the Talmud, as also by Abravanel and other Jewish authorities, of a future life. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he sling out,</span> etc. In forcible contrast with this careful preservation of David's life, she prays that his enemies may be cast away as violently and to as great a distance as a stone is cast out of a sling. The <span class="cmt_word">middle</span> is the hollow in which the stone was placed. <span class="cmt_word">Ruler</span>. i.e. prince. It is the word rendered <span class="accented">captain</span> in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>, but its meaning is more correctly given here. <span class="cmt_word">Grief</span>. The word really means much the same as stumbling block, something which makes a person stagger by his striking against it unawares. Abigail prays, therefore, that when David has become prince, and so has to administer justice, this violent and revengeful act which he was purposing might not prove a cause of stumbling and an offence of heart to himself, by his conscience reproaching him for having himself done that which he had to condemn in others.

But for this prudent conduct on her part in thus coming to meet him on the way, he solemnly assures her on oath that nothing could have saved Nabal and every male in his household from death. Finally, he accepts her present and dismisses her with the assurance that all was forgiven. DEATH OF NABAL AND MARRIAGE OF DAVID AND ABIGAIL (vers. 36-42).

This was not the cause of his heart being merry, but the result; he gave himself up to enjoyment till he became drunken, and then his merriment was over. When Abigail came back he was stupefied by drink, and it was not until the next day, when his debauch was passing off, that he was capable of being told what his wife had done. And when Abigail recounted to him David's fierce resolve, and how she had pacified him, he seems to have given way to a fit of violent indignation, flying out possibly at her as he had at David's messengers (ver. 14), the result of which was an attack of apoplexy, and after lying in a state of insensibility for ten days, he died.

So God had avenged David, while preventing him by Abigail s interference from avenging himself (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-13.htm">1 Samuel 24:13</a>). As a widow's legal mourning seems to have lasted only seven days, David, on hearing of Nabal's death, sent messengers to Abigail at Carmel to ask her in marriage. He was probably moved to this not merely by her sensible conduct, but also by the news that Michal had been given to another. She expresses her willingness in true Oriental fashion by saying she was ready to perform the most abject menial duties, even for his servants, and at once with five maidens proceeds to join him. It is a proof that David considered himself practically secure against Saul's attempts that he thus married and allowed women to accompany his small force, as their presence would not only impede the rapidity of his movements, but also implies a certain amount of case and comfort for their maintenance.
