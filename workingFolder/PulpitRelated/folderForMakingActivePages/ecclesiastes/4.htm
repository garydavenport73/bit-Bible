There was no one to wipe away their tears (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>) or to redress their wrongs. The point is the powerlessness of man in the face of these disorders, his inability to right himself, the incompetence of others to aid him. <span class="cmt_word">On the side of their oppressors there was power</span> (koach), in a bad sense, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> equivalent to "violence."

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec posse resistere eorun violentiae</span>, <span class="accented">cunctorum auxilio destitutes</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is difficult to suppose that the state of things revealed by this verse existed in the days of King Solomon, or that so powerful a monarch, and one admired for "judgment and justice" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>), would be content with complaining of such disorders instead of checking them. There is no token of remorse for past unprofitableness or anguish of heart at the thought of failure in duty. If we take the words as the utterance of the real Solomon, we do violence to history, and must correct the existing chronicles of his reign. The picture here presented is one of later times, and it may be of other countries. Persian rule, or the tyranny of the Ptolemies, might afford an original from which it might be taken.

In our own Burial Service we thank God for delivering the departed "out of the miseries of this sinful world." Keble alludes to this barbarian custom in his poem on' The Third Sunday after Easter.' Speaking of a Christian mother's joy at a child's birth, he says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No need for her to weep<br />Like Thracian wives of yore,<br />Save when in rapture still and deep<br />Her thankful heart runs o'er.<br />They mourned to trust their treasure on the main,<br />Sure of the storm, unknowing of their guide:<br />Welcome to her the peril and the pain,<br />For well she knows the home where they may safely hide."</span> (See on Ecclesiastes 7:1; comp.

The Buddhist religion does not recommend suicide as an escape from the evils of life. It indeed regards man as master of his own life; but it considers suicide foolish, as it merely transfers a man's position, the thread of life having to be taken up again under less favorable circumstances. See 'A Buddhist Catechism,' by Subhadra Bhikshu (London: Redway, 1890). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span> He repeats the words, "under the sun," from ver. 1, in order to show that he is speaking of facts that came under his own regard - outward phenomena which any thoughtful observer might notice (so again ver. 7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour.

The word rendered "right" is <span class="accented">kishron</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 2:21), and means rather "dexterity," "success." Kohe-leth says that he reflected upon the industry that men exhibit, and the skill and dexterity with which they ply their incessant toil. There is no reference to moral rectitude in the reflection, and the allusion to the ostracism of Aristides for being called "Just" overshoots the mark (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "all manliness of his work." <span class="cmt_word">That for this a man is envied of his neighbor.</span> <span class="accented">Kinah</span> may mean either "object of envy" or "envious rivalry;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the clause may be translated as above, or, as in the Revised Version margin, "it cometh of a man's rivalry with his neighbor." The Septuagint is ambiguous, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "That this is a man's envy from his comrade;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Industrias animadverti patere invidiae proximi</span>, "Lay open to a neighbor's envy." In the first case the thought is that unusual skill and success expose a man to envy and ill will, which rob labor of all enjoyment. In the second case the writer says that this superiority and dexterity arise from a mean motive, an envious desire to outstrip a neighbor, and, based on such low ground, can lead to nothing but <span class="cmt_word">vanity and vexation of spirit</span>, a striving after wind. The former explanation seems more in accordance with Koheleth's gloomy view. Success itself is no guarantee of happiness; the malice and ill feeling which it invariably occasions are necessarily a source of pain and distress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The connection of this verse with the preceding is this: activity, diligence, and skill indeed bring success, but success is accompanied by sad results. Should we, then, sink into apathy, relinquish work, let things slide? Nay, none but the fool (<span class="accented">kesil</span>), the insensate, half-brutish man, doth this. <span class="cmt_word">The fool foldeth his hands together</span>. The attitude expresses laziness and disinclination for active labor, like that of the sluggard in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And eateth his own flesh</span>. Ginsburg, Plumptre, and others take these words to mean "and yet eats his meat," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. gets that enjoyment from his sluggishness which is denied to active diligence. They refer, in proof of this interpretation, to <a href="../../par/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, in which passages, however, the phrase is never equivalent to "eating his food." The expression is really equivalent to "destroys himself," "brings ruin upon himself." Thus we have in <a href="../../par/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>, "Evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh;" and in <a href="../../par/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>, "Who eat the flesh of my people" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>). The sluggard is guilty of moral suicide; he takes no trouble to provide for his necessities, and suffers extremities in consequence. Some see in this verse and the following an objection and its answer. There is no occasion for this view, and it is not in keeping with the context; but it contains an intimation of the true exposition, which makes ver. 6 a proverbial statement of the sluggard's position. The verbs in the text are participial in form, so that the Vulgate rendering, which supplies a verb, is quite admissible: <span class="accented">Stultus complicat manna suas</span>, <span class="accented">et comedit carnes suas</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>: <span class="accented">Melior est</span>, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">Better <i>is</i> an handful <i>with</i> quietness, than both the hands full <i>with</i> travail and vexation of spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Better is a handful with quietness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">better a hand full of rest</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">than two hands full of travail</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. This verse, which has been variously interpreted, is most simply regarded as the fool's defense of his indolence, either expressed in his own words or fortified by a proverbial saying. One open hand full of quietness and rest is preferable to two closed hands full of toil and vain effort. The verse must not be taken as the writer's warning against sloth, which would be out of place here, but as enunciating a maxim against discontent and that restless activity which is never satisfied with moderate returns.

Here, he says, is another instance of man's inability to secure his own happiness. Wealth indeed, is supposed to make friends, such as they are; but miserliness and greed separate a man from his fellows, make him suspicious of every one, and drive him to live alone, churlish and unhappy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he hath neither child nor brother</span>; no one to share his wealth, or for whom to save and amass riches. To apply these words to Solomon himself, who had brothers, and one son, if not more, is manifestly inappropriate. They may possibly refer to some circumstance in the writer's own life; but of that we know nothing. <span class="cmt_word">Yet is there no sad of all his labor</span>. In spite of this isolation he plies his weary task, and ceases not to hoard. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is his eye satisfied with riches</span>; so that he is content with what he has (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). The insatiable thirst for gold, the dropsy of the mind, is a commonplace theme in classical writers. Thus Horace, 'Caxm.,' 3:16. 17 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam, Majorumque fames."</span> And Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:138 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum turget sacculus ore,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crevit."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Neither, saith he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good?</span> The original is more dramatic than the Authorized Version or the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec recogitat</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>, <span class="accented">Cui laboro</span>, etc.? The writer suddenly puts himself in the place of the friendless miser, and exclaims, "And for whom do I labor," etc.? We see something similar in ver. 15 and <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>. Here we cannot find any definite allusion to the writer's own circumstances. The clause is merely a lively personification expressive of strong sympathy with the situation described (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>). <span class="accented">Good</span> may mean either riches, in which case the denial to the soul refers to the enjoyment which wealth might afford, or happiness and comfort. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "goodness," "kindness " - which gives quite a different and not so suitable an idea. <span class="cmt_word">Sore travail</span>; a sad business, a woeful employment.

If one or the other fall, the companion will aid him. The idea is that two travelers are making their way over a rough road - an experience that every one must have had in Palestine. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si unus ceciderit</span>. Of course, if both fell at the same time, one could not help the other. Commentators quote Homer, 'Iliad,' 10:220-226, thus rendered by Lord Derby - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Nestor, that heart is mine;<br />I dare alone Enter the hostile camp, so close at hand;<br />Yet were one comrade giv'n me, I should go<br />With more of comfort, more of confidence.<br />Where two combine, one before other sees<br />The better course; and ev'n though one alone<br />The readiest way discover, yet would be<br />His judgment slower, his decision less."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Woe to him that is alone</span>. The same interjection of sorrow, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, occurs in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:16</a>, but elsewhere only in late Hebrew. The verse may be applied to moral falls as well as to stumbling at natural obstacles.

The idea of the traveler is continued. If he were attacked by robbers, he would be easily overpowered when alone; but two comrades might successfully resist the assault. <span class="cmt_word">And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span> This is probably a proverbial saying, like our "Union is strength." Hereby the advantage of association is more strongly enforced. If the companionship of two is profitable, much more is this the case when more combine. The cord of three strands was the strongest made. The number three is used as the symbol of completeness and perfection. <span class="accented">Funiculus triplex diffcile rumpitur</span>, the Vulgate rendering, has become a trite saying; and the gnome has been constantly applied in a mystical or spiritual sense, with which, originally and humanly speaking, it has no concern. Herein is seen an adumbration of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, the Eternal Three in One; of the three Christian virtues, faith, hope, and charity, which go to make the Christian life; of the Christian's body, soul, and spirit, which are consecrated as a temple of the Most High.

The clause says that a youth who is clever and adroit, though sprung from a sordid origin, is better off than a king who has not learned wisdom with his years, and who, it is afterwards implied, is dethroned by this young man. <span class="cmt_word">Who will no more be admonished</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more</span>. Age has only fossilized his self-will and obstinacy; and though he was once open to advice and hearkened to reproof, he now bears no contradiction and takes no counsel.

The words will bear this translation, and it accords with one view of the author's meaning (see below); but that given above is more suitable to the interpretation of the paragraph which approves itself to us. The sentence is of general import, and may be illustrated by a passage from the Book of Wisdom (4. 8, 9), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by length of years. But wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age." So Cicero, 'De Senect.,' 18:62, "Non cant nee rugae repente auctoritatem arripere possunt, sod honeste acta superior aetas fructus capit aactoritatis extremes." Some have thought that Solomon is here speaking of himself, avowing his folly and expressing his contrition, in view of his knowledge of Jeroboam's delegation to the kingdom - the crafty youth of poor estate (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>, etc.), whom the Prophet Ahijah had warned of approaching greatness. But there is nothing in the recorded history of Solomon to make probable such expression of self-abasement, and our author could never have so completely misrepresented him. Here, too, is another proof that Ecclesiastes is not written by Solomon himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also <i>he that is</i> born in his kingdom becometh poor.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</span> The ambiguity of the pronouns has induced different interpretations of this verse. It is plain that the paragraph is intended to corroborate the statement of the previous verse, contrasting the fate of the poor, clever youth with that of the old, foolish king. The Authorized Version makes the pronoun in the first clause refer to the youth, and those in the second to the king, with the signification that rich and poor change places - one is abased as the other is exalted. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quod de carcere catenisque interdum quis egrediatnr ad regnum</span>; <span class="accented">et alius natus in regno inopia consummatur</span>. The Septuagint is somewhat ambiguous, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "For from the house of prisoners he shall come forth to reign, because in his kingdom he [who?] was born [or, 'became'] poor." It seems, however, most natural to make the leading pronouns in both clauses refer to the youth, and thus to render: "For out of the house of prisoners goeth he forth to reign, though even in his kingdom he was born poor." <span class="accented">Beth hasurim</span> is also rendered "house of fugitives," and Hitzig takes the expression as a description of Egypt, whither Jeroboam fled to escape the vengeance of Solomon. Others see here an allusion to Joseph, who was raised from prison, if not to be king, at least to an exalted position which might thus be designated. In this case the old and foolish king who could not look to the future is Pharaoh, who could not understand the dream which was sent for his admonition. Commentators have wearied themselves with endeavoring to find some other historical basis for the supposed allusion in the passage. But although many of these suggestions (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Saul and David, Joash and Amaziah, Cyrus and Astyages, Herod and Alexander) meet a part of the case, none suit the whole passage (vers. 13-16). It is possible, indeed, that some particular allusion is intended to some circumstance or event with which we are not acquainted. At the same time, it seems to us that, without much straining of language, the reference to Joseph can be made good. If it is objected that it cannot be said that Joseph <span class="accented">was born</span> in the kingdom of Egypt, we may reply that the words may be taken to refer to his cruel position in his own country, when he was despoiled and sold, and may be said metaphorically to have "<span class="accented">become</span> poor;" or the word <span class="accented">nolad</span> may be considered as equivalent to "came," "appeared," and need not be restricted to the sense of "born."

The expression is hyperbolical, as Eastern monarchs speak of their dominions as if they comprised the whole world (see <a href="../../par/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span> "With" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) means "in company with," "on the side of;" and the clause should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">That they were with the youth</span>, <span class="accented">the second</span>, <span class="accented">that stood up in his stead</span>. The youth who is called the second is the one spoken of in the previous verses, who by general acclamation is raised to the highest place in the realm, while the old monarch is dethroned or depreciated. He is named <span class="accented">second</span>, as being the successor of the other, either in popular favor or on the throne. It is the old story of worshipping the rising sun. The verse may still be applied to Joseph, who was made second to Pharaoh, and was virtually supreme in Egypt, standing in the king's place (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-44</a>).

Koheleth places himself in the position of a spectator, and marks how numerous are the adherents who flock around the youthful aspirant.

If we still continue the allusion to Joseph, we may see here in this last clause a reference to the change that supervened when another king arose who knew him not (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>), and who, oblivious of the services of this great benefactor, heavily oppressed the Israelites.
