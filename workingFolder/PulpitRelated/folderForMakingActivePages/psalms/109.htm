Calumny and misrepresentation are ever the portion of the children of God. David was calumniated by Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7-13</a>), by Absalom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3, 4</a>), by Shimei (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>), and others.

The hatred of the wicked for the good is a plain fact of history, and quite indisputable. "Words of hatred" are less patent, since they are often restrained from prudential considerations. But sometimes free vent is given to them (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fought against me without a cause</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-161.htm">Psalm 119:161</a>). Saul's hatred towards David was markedly of this character - un-provoked by either act or word from its object.

The tenderness and kindness of the good towards wicked men does not soften them. Rather it provokes them to greater hostility.

It is no doubt true to say, with Tholuck, that "no passion is discernible in the imprecations, dreadful as they are." Clearly the writer is not moved by personal feelings of hostility, but by a spirit of justice, and an intense abhorrence of sin. He delivers a calm judicial sentence. Still, the spirit of Christian love must ever shrink from such utterances, which belong to an earlier and less perfect dispensation (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-56</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thou a wicked man over him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> judge him (see ver. 7).
