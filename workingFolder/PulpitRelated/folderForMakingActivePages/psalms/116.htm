Death is pictured as seizing his victim and binding him with cords. <span class="cmt_word">And the pains of hell gat hold upon me</span>; or, "the <span class="accented">straits</span> of hell" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-3.htm">Lamentations 1:3</a>). Death and hell (shell) are closely connected together in the prayer of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10, 18</a>). I found trouble and sorrow; or, "anguish and woe" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12-17</a>).

"the simple-minded" - those who are without guile or artifice (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I was brought low.</span> The same verb is used here as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, where it is translated "fail" ("mine eyes fail"). It expresses extreme weakness, or exhaustion. And he helped me; or, "saved me" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>).

If Hezekiah is the writer, the "bountiful dealing" will be the addition of fifteen years to his life (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>). If a poet just re turned from the Captivity, the return and the reoccupation of the Holy Land will be especially in his thoughts (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/85-1.htm">Psalm 85:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8</a></div><div class="verse">For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, <i>and</i> my feet from falling.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast delivered my soul from death</span>. This verse is exegetical of the last clause of ver. 4. The expressions are taken from <a href="../../par/psalms/56-13.htm">Psalm 56:13</a>, and suit a personal better than a national deliverance. <span class="cmt_word">Mine eyes from tears.</span> Hezekiah, when told that his death was approaching, had "wept sore" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And my feet from falling</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and my foot from slipping</span> When man is greatly tried, there is always danger lest his foot should slip. Whether the trial befall an individual or a nation, there is the same temptation to rebel and murmur.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a></div><div class="verse">I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - Parenthetic and obscure. Both the connection and rendering are doubtful. Professor Cheyne translates, "I was confident that I should speak thus;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. even while my affliction was going on, I felt confident that relief would come, and that I should one day speak as I have just spoken. I was, however, too sorely afflicted to give utterance to my feeling. Instead of so doing, I vented my unhappiness in abuse of my fellow-men. Thus understood, the words are an <span class="accented">apologia</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I believed, therefore have I spoken</span>. So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. But many other meanings are suggested. See the preceding paragraph. I was greatly afflicted (comp. ver. 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a></div><div class="verse">I said in my haste, All men <i>are</i> liars.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said in my haste, All men are liars</span>. The connection of the thoughts is not apparent, unless God's faithfulness (vers. 5-8) suggests man's unfaithfulness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-12.htm">Psalm 116:12</a></div><div class="verse">What shall I render unto the LORD <i>for</i> all his benefits toward me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-19.</span> - The psalm closes with a thanksgiving for the deliverance vouchsafed. What return can the psalmist make? First, he will accept the blessing joyfully; next, he will ever continue to call upon God (ver. 13; comp. vers. 4, 17); thirdly, he will pay his vows openly in the temple, in the presence of the whole congregation (vers. 14, 18); fourthly, he will offer continually the sacrifice of thanksgiving (ver. 17) for the benefits vouchsafed him. The enumeration of his pious intentions is itself a song of praise to the Almighty. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me</span>? Natural piety suggests a return for favors received. What shall this be? the psalmist asks, and then proceeds to give the answer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-13.htm">Psalm 116:13</a></div><div class="verse">I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will take the cup of salvation</span>. It has been usual to explain this of actual participation in the contents of a cup offered at a sacrificial meal, and then passed round to the worshippers. But there is no clear evidence of any such usage, except in connection with the Passover, which cannot here be in question. Hengstenberg there fore proposes to regard the phrase as a mere metaphor, like the "cup of trembling" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 22</a>), and understands the psalmist to mean that he will gladly and thankfully receive God's mercy vouchsafed to him, and thus show his gratitude for it. <span class="cmt_word">And call upon the Name of the Lord</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14</a></div><div class="verse">I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people</span> (comp. vers. 18, 19, where the thought is repeated, and lengthened out). We are not told in Isaiah or 2 Kings that Hezekiah made any vows when he lay on his sick bed, but he may probably have done so. He certainly intended, as soon as his cure was complete, to "go up to the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-22.htm">Isaiah 38:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a></div><div class="verse">Precious in the sight of the LORD <i>is</i> the death of his saints.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-14.htm">Psalm 72:14</a>). It is not a matter of indifference to God, when and under what circumstances each of his saints dies. Rather, it is a matter of deep concern to him. "In him are the issues of life and death" (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>), and he appoints to each man the day and attendant circumstances of his demise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, truly I <i>am</i> thy servant; I <i>am</i> thy servant, <i>and</i> the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, truly I am thy servant</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even</span> <span class="accented">so</span>, <span class="accented">O Lord</span>, <span class="accented">for I am thy servant</span>. Entitled, therefore, to thy care and consideration. <span class="cmt_word">I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/86-16.htm">Psalm 86:16</a>). "Thine handmaid" - the Church; or, if the writer is Hezekiah, "thy handmaid, Abiyah, the daughter of Zechariah," who "had under standing in the vision of God" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-1.htm">2 Chronicles 29:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast loosed my bonds</span>. The "cords of death" (ver. 3) are probably intended.

Scarcely an actual sacrifice. Rather, simple thanksgiving, which, from a sincere heart, is the best sacrifice (see <a href="../../par/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a> and <a href="../../par/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And will call upon the Name of the Lord</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 13).
