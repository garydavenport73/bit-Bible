For they cast iniquity upon me; or, "hurl wickedness at me" (Cheyne).

The attacks of his enemies (ver. 3) deeply grieve and pain the heart of the psalmist. It is not as if they were foreigners, whose hostility was to be expected. They are his own countrymen; one of them is his own familiar friend (ver. 12). Yet they threaten his life. And the terrors of death are fallen upon ms. When a king is the object of a conspiracy, he well knows, especially in the East, that nothing but his death will satisfy the conspirators. So on David, long before he made up his mind to quit Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>), the "terrors of death" must have fallen.

Where the expectation of a life beyond the grave was so dim and shadowy as in Judaea at this time, the "horror" of death would be the greater. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-6.htm">Psalm 55:6</a></div><div class="verse">And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! <i>for then</i> would I fly away, and be at rest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!</span> The beauty of this passage has sunk deep into the Christian heart. Great composers have set to it some of their most exquisite music. The desire is one which finds an echo in almost every human breast, and the expression of it here has all the beauty of the best Eastern poetry. Jeremiah's words are far tamer, "Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them!" <span class="cmt_word">For then would</span> <span class="cmt_word">I fly away, and be at rest.</span> The desire of "rest" is universal. Whatever the delights of action, they can only charm us for a time. In our hearts we are always longing to have done with action, and to be at rest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-7.htm">Psalm 55:7</a></div><div class="verse">Lo, <i>then</i> would I wander far off, <i>and</i> remain in the wilderness.

Speaking of a rocky gorge near the Lake of Gennesaret, Canon Tristram says, "But no description can give an adequate idea of the myriads of rock-pigeons. In absolute crowds they dashed to and fro in the ravine, whirling round with a rush and a whirr that could be felt like a gust of <span class="accented">wind"</span> ('Land of Israel,' p. 446). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-8.htm">Psalm 55:8</a></div><div class="verse">I would hasten my escape from the windy storm <i>and</i> tempest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest</span>. As doves fly from storm and tempest to their nests in the rocks, so the psalmist would fain haste away from the passions and perils of the city to some safe refuge in the wilds. What he here anticipates, he afterwards accomplished, when he fled from Absalom over Jordan (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-9.htm">Psalm 55:9</a></div><div class="verse">Destroy, O Lord, <i>and</i> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-15.</span> - With a sudden transition, the writer passes from his own suffering, fears, and longings, to imprecations on his enemies, and a description of their wicked proceedings. In the course of his description he singles out one individual for special remark - one who had been his own guide, companion, and friend - but who had turned against him, and joined the company of his adversaries (vers. 12-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues</span>. The second clause contains a reference to the confusion of tongues at Babel (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>). "Introduce confusion into their counsels, and disperse them, as thou didst with the wicked ones who were forced to leave off to build the Tower." <span class="cmt_word">For I have seen violence and strife in the city</span>. Such quarrels and broils, <span class="accented">i.e</span>., as usually precede revolutionary disturbance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-10.htm">Psalm 55:10</a></div><div class="verse">Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow <i>are</i> in the midst of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Day and night they go about it upon the walls</span> <span class="cmt_word">thereof.</span> "It is not a siege or blockade that is described; and the persons spoken of are not foreign, but native enemies. These are compared to watchmen  on the walls; only, instead of keeping watch against the enemy, they 'watch for iniquity' "(Cheyne). Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it; rather, <span class="accented">iniquity also and trouble.</span> Compare the "violence and strife" of ver. 9. Society is disorganized. It is not only that wickedness prevails, but throughout the city there is violence and contention. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-11.htm">Psalm 55:11</a></div><div class="verse">Wickedness <i>is</i> in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets;</span> literally, <span class="accented">out of her street</span> (<span class="accented">rehob</span>)  - "the open square, where justice ought to have been administered "(Kay), "adjoining the vaulted passage of the city gate" (Cheyne); comp. <a href="../../par/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12</a></div><div class="verse">For <i>it was</i> not an enemy <i>that</i> reproached me; then I could have borne <i>it</i>: neither <i>was it</i> he that hated me <i>that</i> did magnify <i>himself</i> against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it was not an enemy that</span> <span class="cmt_word">reproached me; then I could have borne it.</span> The psalmist passes from the general to the particular - from the great mass of his opponents to one special individual. Even Professor Cheyne allows this, and suggests that we have here Jeremiah inveighing against Pashur. But the general sentiment of commentators has always been that Ahithophel is intended. And, if we allow the psalm to be David's, we can scarcely give any other explanation. Ahithophel was known as "David's counsellor" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his chief adviser, his "grand vizier," his "prime minister? What he counselled was considered as a sort of "oracle of God" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>). His defection was the bitterest drop in the cup of the unhappy king. Anything else he "could have borne;" but this was too much. Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me. It was not one among my professed and open enemies  - not one of those whose hatred I had long known and reckoned on. Then I would have hid myself from him. Instead of opening all my heart to him, as I have done to Ahithophel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a></div><div class="verse">But <i>it was</i> thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it was thou, a man mine equal</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a man according to my valuing</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of my social rank, with whom I was on familiar terms.

And walked unto the house of God in company; rather, <span class="accented">in the throng</span> (Cheyne, Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the midst of the crowd of worshippers. When David went up to the house of God, who is more likely to have accompanied him than his chief "counsellor"? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a></div><div class="verse">Let death seize upon them, <i>and</i> let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness <i>is</i> in their dwellings, <i>and</i> among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let death seize upon them</span>. As this strophe begins (ver. 9), so it ends, with an imprecation. The psalmist calls on God to bring destruction upon the whole mass <span class="cmt_word">of</span> his enemies. Of the two readings in the original, the one adopted by our translators seems the best, "Let death come suddenly upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Let them go down quick</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">alive</span>) into hell. There is an allusion to the fate of Korah and his company (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30-33</a>), who "went down quick into the pit;" but probably the psalmist neither expected nor desired a literal fulfilment of his imprecation. The deaths of Ahithophel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>) and Absalom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14, 15</a>), and of so many of Absalom's followers (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7, 8</a>), were quite a sufficient fulfilment. <span class="cmt_word">For wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</span> (comp. vers. 3, 9-11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a></div><div class="verse">As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-23.</span> - In conclusion, the psalmist turns altogether to God, whom he now addresses as "Jehovah" (vers. 16, 22), and expresses his confidence that, in answer to his continual prayers (ver. 17), God will come to his aid, will deliver his soul from the machinations of his enemies, and will visit them with "affliction" (ver. 19) and "destruction" (ver. 23). Still grieved chiefly by the defection of his unfaithful friend, he once more describes the treachery and heinousness of his conduct (vers. 20. 21), before winding up with a word of comfort for all the righteous (ver. 22), and of menace against all the ungodly (ver. 23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">shall save me.</span> The call is upon the God known to man by nature as the Almighty Ruler of the universe; the answer is from the covenant God of Israel, the Self-existent One, in whom Israel trusts. The two are different aspects of one and the same Being.

From this passage and from Daniel's conduct (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>) we learn that devout Israelites habitually offered prayer to God at these three times of the day. The "morning "<span class="accented">and</span> "evening" devotions were doubtless suggested by the law of the morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>); but the midday prayer, being nowhere commanded, can only be ascribed to natural piety. And he shall hear my voice. Constant unremitting prayer is certain of an answer. Compare the parable of the importunate friend (<a href="../../par/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5-8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a></div><div class="verse">He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle <i>that was</i> against me: for there were many with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me.</span> Once mere "the preterite of prophetic certainty." David sees his deliverance effected. He beholds the coming battle (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-11.htm">2 Samuel 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6-8</a>).  <span class="cmt_word">He sees that there are many with him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "many that contend with him;" but his courage does not fail - he is assured of being "delivered" and re-established in his kingdom "in peace."

Ahithophel had put forth his hand against such as were at peace with him." <span class="cmt_word">He hath broken his covenant</span>. The covenant of friendship with David (ver. 14), not, perhaps, a formal one, but involved in the terms on which they stood one towards the other.
