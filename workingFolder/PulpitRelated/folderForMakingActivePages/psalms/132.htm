LORD, remember David, <i>and</i> all his afflictions:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - David's abasement and vow to God. The historical books give no account of this vow, which, however, may have been recorded in one or other of the lost compositions spoken of so frequently in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-11.htm">2 Chronicles 16:11</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remember to David all his affliction</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. reckon it to him, and reward him for it. The "affliction" intended is the distress that David felt at the thought that, while he dwelt in a house of cedar, the ark of God was only lodged within curtains (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2</a></div><div class="verse">How he sware unto the LORD, <i>and</i> vowed unto the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How he sware unto the Lord</span> (see the comment on vers. 1-5). <span class="cmt_word">And vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Mighty One of Jacob</span> (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3</a></div><div class="verse">Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house</span>. I will not take up my abode quietly and comfortably in my own solid and substantial house (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor go up into my bed</span>. Indulge, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>., in luxurious repose. (Fur a contrary feeling on the part of some Israelites, see <a href="../../par/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a></div><div class="verse">I will not give sleep to mine eyes, <i>or</i> slumber to mine eyelids,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to my eyelids</span>. Exegetical of the last clause of ver. 3. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-5.htm">Psalm 132:5</a></div><div class="verse">Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until I find out a place for the Lord</span>. The "place" which David desired to "find" was a permanent resting-place for the ark of God, which he had already "brought up from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with gladness" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>), but which he had only established in a temporary abode of the nature of a tent, or tabernacle (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>). God approved David's zeal, but did not allow him to accomplish his design (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An habitation for the mighty God of Jacob</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Mighty One of Jacob</span> (comp. ver. 2 and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a></div><div class="verse">Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-10.</span> - The realization of David's design. The resting-place is, after a time, discovered and prepared. The ark is brought up and placed in it (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1-11</a>). The "priests" are" clothed with righteousness," and the "saints shout for joy." God "turns not away the face of his anointed," but accepts the costly offering. God himself "arises into his rest," and makes his presence visible from the mercy-seat (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah</span>. "It" is probably "the ark" - not yet mentioned, but a main object of the writer's thoughts; and "Ephratah" is the district south and west of Jerusalem, in which both Bethlehem and Kirjath-jearim were situated. <span class="cmt_word">And found it in the fields of the wood</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the fields of Jaar</span>. "Jaar" is a contracted and poetic name for Kirjath-jearim, where the ark remained from its return out of the country of the Philistines till David transferred it to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5-13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a></div><div class="verse">We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool</span>. The transfer is regarded as accomplished, and the worship as re-established, which had been intermitted while the ark was at Kirjath-jearim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-8.htm">Psalm 132:8</a></div><div class="verse">Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise, O Lord, into thy rest</span>. Another transfer, but into the place of final "rest." The words are a quotation from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a>:41, and were uttered originally by Solomon at the close of his long dedication prayer. <span class="cmt_word">Thou, and the ark of thy strength</span>. The quotation continues. God is regarded as entering the temple, and taking possession of it, in and with the ark. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a></div><div class="verse">Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness</span>. In 2 Chronicles the expression used is "with salvation" - salvation being the effect, whereof "righteousness" is the cause. <span class="cmt_word">And let thy saints shout for joy</span>. 2 Chronicles has, "rejoice in goodness," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. rejoice in God's goodness to them. There is no other sufficient reason for great joy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-10.htm">Psalm 132:10</a></div><div class="verse">For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</span> Here the text diverges still more from that of Chronicles, which runs thus: "O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant" The meaning, however, is much the same in both passages: "For David's sake, to whom thou hast shown so many mercies, turn not away the face - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. reject not the petition, or the offering - of his representative." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath sworn <i>in</i> truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-18.</span> - God's oath of promise to David. This passage is based mainly on <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>, but contains likewise expressions which seem taken from other psalms, as <a href="../../par/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-16.htm">Psalm 68:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a>. The chief promise is that of a special "fruit of his body" to be "set upon his throne" (ver. 11) and to reign in Zion forever (vers. 13, 14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3, 35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will not turn from it</span>. So it is said of another Divine oath, "The Lord sware, <span class="accented">and will not repent"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a></div><div class="verse">If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne forevermore</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-16</a>, where the conditional character of the promises made to David is also apparent). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired <i>it</i> for his habitation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.</span> Here we are brought back again to the temple. Zion, the city of David, was also "the city of the great King" (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>) - the place where he had "set his Name" - which he was bound to protect and cherish. "As truly as God had chosen Zion, and made his habitation there, so certainly must he also raise up for David a branch, through which to his people concentrated there he will impart salvation" (Hengstenberg). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-14.htm">Psalm 132:14</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is my rest forever: here will I dwell</span>; for I have desired it (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-16.htm">Psalm 68:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-15.htm">Psalm 132:15</a></div><div class="verse">I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</span> Literally, this seems to point to the blessing of abundance of food. Spiritually, it may be a promise of ample spiritual sustenance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a></div><div class="verse">I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will also clothe her priests with salvation</span> (comp. ver. 9). More is pro-raised than was asked for. <span class="cmt_word">And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</span> Here, too, the promise goes beyond the request in ver. 9. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a></div><div class="verse">There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There will I make the horn of David to bud</span>. The "horn of David" budded most gloriously when "a rod came forth out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch grew out of his roots, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon him" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 2</a>) - in other words, when Messiah appeared, and re-established the Davidian kingdom, which thenceforth has endured, and will endure for ever. <span class="cmt_word">I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</span> The metaphor is changed; but the idea is the same. Christ's coming shed a glory on David's house, and on the temple, and on David himself, such as had never previously illumined them. David is often promised "a lamp" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a>). In Christ the lamp was given. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/132-18.htm">Psalm 132:18</a></div><div class="verse">His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His enemies will I clothe with shame</span>. David's "enemies" are those who oppress his "Seed," and will not have him to reign over them. All such will be "confounded and put to shame" (<a href="../../par/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>), "clothed with shame and dishonor" (<a href="../../par/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But upon himself shall his crown flourish.</span> The true and the final Davidic representative is Christ, who "remaineth a King forever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10</a>).
