The position would be a high one, and would imply the possession of much physical strength. A sense of tyranny or extreme arrogance seems to attach to the word translated "mighty one" (<span class="accented">gibber</span>); see <a href="../../par/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8</a>. The word translated "mischief" implies something worse. In <a href="../../par/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a> it is rendered "wickedness," and is thought to mean, in the Psalms generally, "ruinous, unfathomable evil - destructive malignity" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">The goodness of God endureth continually</span>. Why not follow the Divine pattern, instead of setting thyself in direct antagonism to it? Canst thou expect to prosper when thou art thus opposed to the Almighty?

It was Doeg's "tongue" that brought about the entire ghastly massacre (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9, 10</a>). Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. Doeg had "worked deceitfully," since he had not told Saul the circumstances that made Ahimelech's giving aid to David no disloyalty to the king (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2, 8</a>).

The root of Doeg's wickedness was want of trust in God, and consequent alienation from him. <span class="cmt_word">But trusted in the abundance of his</span> <span class="cmt_word">riches.</span> This led on to an excessive trust in riches, and greediness of gain. To obtain wealth he became Saul's unscrupulous tool, the willing instrument of his cruelty.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a></div><div class="verse">But I <i>am</i> like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God</span>. In conclusion, the psalmist contrasts his own condition, as one of God's people, with that of Doeg, which he had described in vers. 7-9. Doeg is about to be "plucked up" and "rooted out of the land of the living" (ver. 5); he is like a flourishing green olive tree planted in the sanctuary, or "house of God." Doeg is entirely without any trust in the Almighty (ver. 7); he declares of himself, <span class="cmt_word">I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever</span>. It is questioned whether olive trees were at any time planted in the courts of either the tabernacle or the temple; but it certainly cannot be proved that they were not. In the courts of Egyptian temples trees were abundant (Herod., 2:138; Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 236), also probably in Phoenician temples (Perrot and Chipiez, ' Histoire de l'Art dans l'An-tiquite,' vol. 3. p. 322). And to this day there grow in the Hardin area at Jerusalem, on the site of the Jewish temple, a number of magnificent cypresses, olive, and lemon trees.
