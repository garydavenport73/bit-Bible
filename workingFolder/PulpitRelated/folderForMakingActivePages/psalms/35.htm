The word translated "plead" is a judicial term; but the context shows that it was in the battle-field, rather than in the law-courts, that David's cause was to be pleaded. The second hemistich is therefore added to explain and correct the first; it is fighting, not pleading, that is needed under the circumstances.

The "shield and buckler" are put forward first, because it is primarily defence and protection that David needs. His adversaries are the aggressors; he is on the defensive; Saul is hunting him upon the mountains. And stand up for mine help (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>).

(So Vitringa, Michaelis, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, Mr. Aglen, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.') The passage will then read, "Bring out also the spear and the battle-axe against them that persecute me," which is certainly a better parallel to "Take hold of shield and buckler," than "Bring out the spear, and stop the way."

Once more the language of complaint. David's enemies, though they have driven him from the court, and made him a fugitive and a wanderer, were not yet satisfied. They did not speak him peace. They continued to scheme against him. <span class="cmt_word">But they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet</span>  <span class="cmt_word">in the land</span>. David, if let alone, was willing enough to have remained "quiet in the land." He was a fugitive and an outlaw; but, could he have obtained a safe refuge - the cave of Adullam, or any other - would gladly have remained peacefully within it. But his enemies would not allow him to remain quiet. They stirred up the jealousy and hatred of Saul by false tales, and caused him to be "hunted upon the mountains" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>).

This they will do, partly, out of sympathy; partly because their own interests are bound up with those of their leader. Had Saul captured David when he "hunted him upon the mountains," the fate of David's followers would have been death or exile. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the peace of his servant.</span> God desires that David's present troubles should cease, and that he should enjoy a time of rest and tranquillity. This was granted him, to some extent, at Ziklag (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-4.htm">1 Samuel 27:4-7</a>), but more fully when he came into his kingdom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-16</a>).
