The harp obtains mention here for the first time in the Psalms. Reference, however, had been made to it previously in Genesis, Job, and the First Book of Samuel. There is reason to believe that the instrument, as known to the Hebrews, was a simple one, consisting of a nearly triangular framework of wood, crossed by seven strings. The Egyptians were acquainted from early times with a very much more elaborate instrument  - harps which stood six feet high upon a broad base of their own, and had as many as twenty-two strings (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 521). The harp was regarded by the Hebrews as peculiarly fitted for sacred music (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1, 3, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sing unto him with the lute of ten strings.</span> One instrument only is here mentioned - a lute or psaltery (<span class="accented">nebel</span>), having ten strings (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a>). The <span class="accented">nebel</span> was an instrument differing from the harp chiefly in the arrangement of the strings.

We cannot imagine it otherwise, for God would contradict his own nature, if he ordained by a positive law anything contrary to that rule. But still we maybe thankful that there is no such contradiction - that "the Law is holy, just, and good" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And all his works are done in truth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/111-7.htm">Psalm 111:7, 8</a>, "The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.

All God's working (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span>), all his dealings with his creatures have truth and equity and faithfulness for their basis. He can be thoroughly trusted. This is a second and very strong ground for thanksgiving.

The righteous were sometimes "kept alive" through a time of famine by miraculous means (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6, 16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a></div><div class="verse">Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he <i>is</i> our help and our shield.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - A brief address of the people to God, arising out of what has been declared concerning his goodness (vers. 4, 5, 12-19) and his power (vers. 6-11), which constitute a call upon them for praise and adoration.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our soul waiteth for the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/25-21.htm">Psalm 25:21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5, 6</a>, etc.). Confident in God's good will, and in his power to help us, we wait patiently and cheerfully for him to manifest himself in his own good time. <span class="cmt_word">He is our Help and our Shield</span>. We trust in no one and nothing but him - not in armies (ver. 16), not in horses (ver. 17), not in our own strength (ver. 16). He alone is our dependence. (For the use of the metaphor "shield" for defence, see <a href="../../par/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-114.htm">Psalm 119:114</a>, etc.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/33-21.htm">Psalm 33:21</a></div><div class="verse">For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in</span> <span class="cmt_word">his holy Name</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/13-5.htm">Psalm 13:5</a>, where the sentiment is the same). Trust in God secures his help, and this brings the deliverance at which the heart rejoices. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/33-22.htm">Psalm 33:22</a></div><div class="verse">Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according</span> <span class="cmt_word">as we hope in thee.</span> The measure of men's hope and trust in God is the measure of his mercy and goodness to them. Those who are assured that they have a full trust in him may confidently expect a fall and complete deliverance. Thus, "according as" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> - is emphatic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/32.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 32"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 32" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/34.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 34"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 34" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
