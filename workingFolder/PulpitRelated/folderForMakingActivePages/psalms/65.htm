"All flesh" <span class="accented">might</span> certainly, in a psalmist's mouth, mean no more than "all Israel" (so Ewald and Hitzig).

And causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts. Among the peculiar privileges, one of the greatest was that of approaching God's presence in his holy temple, and entering his "courts" and worshipping there. This all Israelites were not only permitted, but commanded to do, at least three times in the year, while the dwellers in Jerusalem, privileged above the rest, had constant opportunities of attending, and using to the full the means of grace provided for them in the sanctuary. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. In "the goodness of God's house" the psalmist includes, not only the delights there experienced, but also all the blessings which God gives to those who devoutly worship him there - "from the forgiveness of sins to outward, temporal mercies" (Hengstenberg).

This is a sequel to ver. 2. As God hears prayer and answers it, so when his people cry to him for protection and deliverance from their foes, the result can only be righteous judgments of a fearful character upon the persecutors. O God of our salvation; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God through whom we obtain salvation. Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth (see the comment on ver. 2, and comp. ver. 8).

The mountains set forth his majesty and permanence (ver. 6); the seas and waves, his power to control and subdue (ver. 7); the outgoings of the morning and evening - sunrise and sunset - his gracious loving kindness (ver. 8). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/95-4.htm">Psalm 95:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). The mountains are an emblem of God's strength and firmness and fixedness. They stand up in still and silent majesty; they seem as if they could never be moved. He who created them must be girded with power (camp. <a href="../../par/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>).

The power of God, as set forth in his control of the sea, is a favourite topic with the sacred writers (see <a href="../../par/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>, etc.). Being so entirely beyond his own control, it seems to man one of the greatest of marvels that there should be any force  capable of subduing and taming it, Hence the admiration excited by our Lord's miracle (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26, 27</a>). The noise of their waves (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>). And the tumult of the people. This clause may seem a little out of place in a passage which treats of God's power over nature. But, after all, humanity is a constituent part of nature. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a></div><div class="verse">They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid of thy tokens; g.e. they see thy tokens - indications of thy mighty power - and are filled with awe. Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening (or, the <span class="accented">portals of morn and eve</span> - the gateways through which the sun comes forth each morning and retires each evening) to rejoice; &cent;.e. to gladden mankind, to spread joy and gladness over the earth. The splendour of sunrise and sunset are in the poet's mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a></div><div class="verse">Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, <i>which</i> is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-13.</span> - In conclusion, the psalmist praises God for his bountiful providence with respect to the harvest. According to some, the whole poem is essentially a harvest thanksgiving, and the poet now "comes at last to the point aimed at from the first." He traces the whole process by which the glorious termination is arrived at. First, the "early rain" descending from "the river of God," or the reservoir for rain which God guards in the heavens (<a href="../../par/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), moistening the furrows, softening the ridges, and preparing the land for the seed-corn. Then the sowing, which, being man's work, is but just touched on (ver. 9, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). After that, the "latter rain" - the gentle showers of March and April - which cause the grain to burst and the blade to spring, and the ear to form itself, and turn the dull fallow into a mass of greenery (vers. 10, 12). At last, the full result - pastures clothed with flocks; valleys, the "long broad sweeps between parallel ranges of hills," covered over with corn; all nature laughing and shouting for joy (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it (comp. <a href="../../par/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). Thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God. There is no "with" in the original; and the two clauses are better taken separately. Translate, Thou greatly <span class="accented">enrichest it; the river of God is full of water.</span> By "the river of God" is to be understood God's store of water in the clouds and atmosphere, which he can at any time retain or let loose. Thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it; rather, <span class="accented">when thou hast so prepared her</span> (the earth). By thus preparing the earth for the sowing. God prepares for men the corn which they ultimately obtain at the harvest.

Thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. The whole ground being softened with warm showers, the springing of the blade begins under God's blessing.

As God had begun, so he goes on to the "crowning" of the whole. And thy paths drop fatness. As he moves about, visiting the earth (ver. 9), there drop from him fertility and abundance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a></div><div class="verse">They drop <i>upon</i> the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; rather, <span class="accented">the pastures of the wilderness drip with it; i.e.</span> with the "fatness" which is shed from God's presence.

The great open sweeps between the ranges of hills are completely covered over with grain crops, wheat, barley, millet; and the result is that they seem to shout for joy, they also sing. This is better than the rendering of Ewald and Delitzsch, "Man shouts for joy; he sings."
