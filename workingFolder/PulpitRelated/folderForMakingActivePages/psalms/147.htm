The rebuilding of Jerusalem after the return from the Babylonish captivity covered a space of above ninety years, from  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> till  <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>. First the temple was built (B.C. 533-515); then the city; finally, the walls and the gates ( <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>). It was in connection with this last portion of the building that the present psalm seems to have been written. <span class="cmt_word">He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</span> The exiles returned gradually - some with Zerubbabel ( <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>); some with Ezra, in  <span class="date">B.C. 457</span>; others, doubtless, with Nehemiah, in  <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>; and again in  <span class="date">B.C. 434</span>.

The cruel heat of the solar rays in a clear sky for weeks or months together causes a longing of the intensest kind for shade and moisture. Man and beast alike rejoice when the time of the autumn rains draws near, and the cloudless blue of the summer heaven gives place (of a sky that is gray and overcast (comp. <a href="../../par/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25-41</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.</span> The "mountains," and even the plains of Palestine, are, with rare exceptions, completely burnt up at the close of summer, and show no verdure, but merely an arid sapless, brown or buff vegetation. When the" former rain" begins, a great change begins. Tender green blades of grass at once sprout up, and in a little time the whole country shows a tinge of verdure.

In a certain sense, God no doubt "delights" in the glory and excellency of all his creatures; but their physical endowments do not give him the sensible pleasure which he derives from the moral qualities of his rational creation (see ver. 11). The negation is not absolute, but relative (compare "I will have mercy, <span class="accented">and not</span> sacrifice"). <span class="cmt_word">He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in his strength and swiftness.

The "bars" of the gates of Jerusalem are mentioned in Nehemiah repeatedly (<a href="../../par/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3, 6</a>, 13, 14, 15; 7:3). <span class="cmt_word">He hath blessed thy children within thee.</span> Under Nehemiah's govern-meet, when he had firmly established it, Israel enjoyed a period of repose and of great prosperity, which, at the date of the psalm, was probably just commencing.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/147-16.htm">Psalm 147:16</a></div><div class="verse">He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He giveth snow like wool</span>. The loveliness of new-fallen snow has evidently been felt by the psalmist, to whom it has seemed like a spotless robe of whitest wool spread upon the earth. Snow, though rare in Palestine, does occasionally fall, and is said to "cover the streets of Jerusalem two winters out of three. It generally comes in small quantities; but there are sometimes very snowy winters." In 1879, for instance, snow lay in Jerusalem to a depth of seventeen inches (Geikic, 'The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 2. p. 58). <span class="cmt_word">He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes</span>. The metaphor is less appropriate, and was selected, probably, on account of the near resemblance of the two words, <span class="accented">kephor</span> and <span class="accented">kaepher</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/147-17.htm">Psalm 147:17</a></div><div class="verse">He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He casteth forth his ice like morsels</span>; or, "like crumbs;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in profusion, as men feed birds. The "ice" intended would seem to be that of hailstones. <span class="cmt_word">Who can stand before his cold?</span> Though the thermometer rarely shows more than six or seven degrees of frost in Palestine, yet the Oriental is as much chilled by such a temperature as the Englishman by one twenty degrees lower. He shivers in his light attire, and is very reluctant to leave the shelter of his house or tent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a></div><div class="verse">He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, <i>and</i> the waters flow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sendeth out his word, and melteth them</span> (comp. ver. 15). God has only to "speak the word," and all trace of winter disappears - hoar-frost, hail, snow, melt away, and the atmosphere is once more soft and genial. <span class="cmt_word">He causeth his wind to blow.</span> The change usually comes With a change of wind, which, as with ourselves, is commonly cold from the north and east, warm from the west and south. <span class="cmt_word">And the waters flow</span>.

Beyond and above all the physical blessings which God bestows on man are the gifts of spiritual enlightenment and direction. These also Israel may count on receiving from him, who has already given them a written revelation - "statutes and judgments" - while he also enlightens and directs them from time to time by his prophets.
