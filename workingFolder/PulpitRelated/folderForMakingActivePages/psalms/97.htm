The "darkness" does not belong to the nature of God, who "is Light, and in him is no darkness at all" (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), but to the interrelationship between God and man, in which are involved problems that man cannot solve. <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the foundation of his throne</span> - the firm basis on which it is immovably fixed.

The earth itself is regarded as not only shaken (ver. 4), but as melting and crumbling away at the descent of God from heaven to earth (comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/3-11.htm">Joshua 3:11, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>).

It is quite natural that the effect of the theophany on God's enemies should be noted <span class="accented">first.</span> The effect is that  they are "confounded," or rather, <span class="accented">covered with shame.</span> The display of real Divine power makes manifest the impotency of the idols, and puts their worshippers to the blush. <span class="cmt_word">Worship him, all ye gods.</span> The theophany is a call on the false gods to worship the true God.

To Zion, the Church of God, the company of his saints, the theophany brings, not shame, but rejoicing. The Lord comes for their relief, for their deliverance, for their exaltation. <span class="cmt_word">And the daughters of Judah rejoiced.</span> The"daughters of Judah" are the other cities of Judaea besides Jerusalem. In a Christian sense, they may be taken to represent the irregularly organized Churches, which will participate in the general joy of the faithful at Christ's final coming. <span class="cmt_word">Because of thy judgments, O Lord.</span> It does not show any vindictive feeling, if the saints, persecuted so long, "rejoice" when an end is put to their sufferings by the final judgment of the wicked.

God hates evil (<a href="../../par/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>); evil will separate them from God, evil will be their destruction. Therefore let them hate and abhor it. It is indifference to evil, that, more than anything else, lays men open to the assaults of Satan. <span class="cmt_word">He preserveth the souls of his saints</span>. He (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah) watches tenderly over the souls of his saints - his holy loving ones, and preserves them in being, keeps them from destruction, and <span class="cmt_word">delivereth them out</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the hand of the wicked.</span>
