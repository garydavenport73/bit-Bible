He has enemies, both domestic and foreign. In his early youth Saul becomes his enemy out of jealousy; then most of Saul's courtiers espouse their master's quarrel, he has enemies at the court of Achish; enemies in his family, even among his sons, as Absalom enemies among his counsellors, as Ahithophel; foreign enemies on all sides of him - Philistines, Edomites, Moabites,  Ammonites, Amalekites, Syrians, Mesopotamians, etc. Against all of them he invokes God's aid, and by God's aid he triumphs over all. <span class="cmt_word">Defend me from them that rise up against me;</span> or, <span class="accented">set me on high above them</span> (Kay, Revised Version). David's domestic foes "rose up against him," no less than his foreign foes; made war on him; sought to seize his person, and put him to death.

This seems to be the "lying in wait" intended. Warned by his wife, Michal, Saul's daughter, David fled from his house during the night through a window, and so saved himself (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The mighty</span> (or, <span class="accented">the strong ones</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord</span>.

"The Hebrew words denote treachery and faithlessness" (Cook). They are scarcely applicable to open foreign enemies.

The "enemies" of ver. 1 and the "workers of iniquity" of ver. 2 are more elaborately portrayed. First they are represented as "dogs" - such hideous, half-wild dogs as frequent Eastern cities, which sleep during the greater part of the day, and rove about in packs at night - unclean, horrid, loathsome animals (ver. 6). Then they appear as men - abusive, slanderous, godless (ver. 7). In conclusion, appeal is made to God against them. He will "laugh them to scorn" (ver. 8); and he is a sure Defence against all their efforts (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They return at evening.</span> Having traced David to his house, they disperse for a time, but "return" again at evening, and take up their watch (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They make a noise like a dog;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> snarl and growl, quarrelling more or less among themselves during the night time. <span class="cmt_word">And go round about the city.</span> Either wander vaguely about, as dogs do for prey, or patrol the walls and gates to see that David does not quit the city, and so escape them.

Their pride, their cursing, their lying, are denounced (ver. 12). The psalmist trusts to "see his desire" upon them (ver. 10). First he begs that they may not be slain, but only "scattered abroad," so that they may remain as examples of God's vengeance for the warning of others (ver. 11). Then, forgetting this wish, he pleads for their capture and their utter destruction, without which God's glory will not be fully vindicated (vers. 12, 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The God of my mercy shall prevent me;</span> or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">God with his mercy shall prevent</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> anticipate) <span class="accented">me</span>. <span class="cmt_word">God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>).
