By "known" is meant "freshly made known," "revealed," as it were, "anew" by the recent wonderful deliverance. <span class="cmt_word">His Name is great in Israel;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> greatly honourcd and regarded, on account of what has happened.

"Salem" was probably a shortened form of the full and complete name, like "Peer" for "Baalpeor," "Maachah" for "Aram-Maa-chah," "El Kuds" for "Beit-el-Kuds," and the like. (So Professor Cheyne.) "Salem" is the <span class="accented">peaceful</span> place, the place where God's presence breathed peace and tranquillity. It is only used here and in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-11.htm">Genesis 14:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Is his tabernacle;</span> literally, <span class="accented">his tent</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/61-4.htm">Psalm 61:4</a>). The temple is meant, as even Professor Cheyne sees. It took the place of the original "tabernacle," and was modelled upon it. <span class="cmt_word">And his dwelling place in Zion</span>; or, "<span class="accented">his lair"</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-22.htm">Psalm 104:22</a>).

Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There brake he the arrows of the bow</span>. The expression "there" seems certainly to show that the deliverance celebrated took place at, or very near to, Jerusalem. This would sufficiently suit the destruction of Sennacherib's army, which certainly occurred in the neighbourhood, though not very close to the city (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a>, 38). The word translated "arrows" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e4;&#x5d9;</span>) means properly "lightnings" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-48.htm">Psalm 78:48</a>), and expresses the swift flight of the arrow, not actual "fiery darts." <span class="cmt_word">The shield, and the sword, and the battle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the war equipment</span> (Kay, Cheyne). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-4.htm">Psalm 76:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thou <i>art</i> more glorious <i>and</i> excellent than the mountains of prey.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.</span> The psalmist, in this, the main portion of his psalm, directly addresses God. "Thou, O God," he says, "art glorious," or "terrible" (comp. ver. 7, where the same word is used), "and excellent, more than the mountains of prey," or perhaps "from the mountains of  spoil;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from Jerusalem, where the spoils of the Assyrians are laid up, and where thou sittest and rulest. (So Professor Cheyne and Canon Cook.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-5.htm">Psalm 76:5</a></div><div class="verse">The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The stout hearted are spoiled.</span> A "vivid description of the catastrophe" now follows. The "stout hearted," the aggressors, the great dominant race, that has spoiled all the nations of the earth, and fears no one (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12-14</a>, "The stout heart of the King of Assyria"), is itself spoiled in turn. <span class="cmt_word">They have slept their sleep.</span> They have slept, and, as they slept (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>), they found it indeed a sleep, even the sleep of death. <span class="cmt_word">And none of the men of might have found their hands.</span> The mighty men, suddenly assaulted by the grim destroyer, Death, can make no resistance; they are paralyzed; they cannot even move a hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a></div><div class="verse">At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob.</span> The catastrophe has been God's doing; man has had no part in it (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28, 35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Both the chariot and the horse are cast into a dead sleep.</span> Metonymy for the charioteers and the horsemen (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>). These were the two chief arms of the military service with the Assyrians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-7.htm">Psalm 76:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou, <i>even</i> thou, <i>art</i> to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, even thou, art to be feared.</span> God is to he feared as well as loved. Only "perfect love casteth out fear" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>), and "perfect love" is not for mortals. <span class="cmt_word">And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</span> literally, <span class="accented">from the time of thine anger</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/5-23.htm">Exodus 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-8.htm">Psalm 76:8</a></div><div class="verse">Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven.</span> By the destruction of Sennacherib's host, God spoke, as it were, with a voice of thunder, to the whole earth. He delivered a "judgment," or a "sentence" (Revised Version), which could not be ignored. <span class="cmt_word">The earth feared, and was still.</span> All the world, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the Oriental world, feared. The attention of the nations of Western Asia generally was attracted (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>), and their minds were affected with a wholesome fear of Jehovah. The result was that they remained at rest and gave Israel rest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-9.htm">Psalm 76:9</a></div><div class="verse">When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When God arose to judgment</span> (see the preceding verses). God's "rising" is an anthropomorphism, drawn from the tact that men "rise up" when they proceed to take vengeance (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-26.htm">Psalm 44:26</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-1.htm">Psalm 68:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To save all the meek of the earth</span>. God's vengeances on the wicked are, in great measure, for the relief of the righteous. Sennacherib's discomfiture relieved "the meek of the earth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only Israel, but many other downtrodden and oppressed nations. The psalmist's sympathies are with all the victims of Assyrian ambition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a></div><div class="verse">Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee.</span> The sentiment is general, but no doubt there is a special reference to the recent deliverance. The "wrath of man," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> man's wicked fury and hostility of God and his people, shall give occasion for great deeds on God's part - deeds which will bring him praise and honour. <span class="cmt_word">The remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain</span>. Either, "the unexpended fury of thine enemies, that which they have not vented, thou wilt hold in check, and prevent from doing mischief;" or else," with thine own unexpended wrath wilt thou gird thyself against the wicked, as with a weapon." (So Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-11.htm">Psalm 76:11</a></div><div class="verse">Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vow</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and pay unto the Lord your God.</span> The people of Israel are now addressed. Under the circumstances, they are sure to have made vows to God in the time of their great trouble, before the deliverance came. Now, when the deliverance has come, let them pay these vows. <span class="cmt_word">Let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared;</span> literally, <span class="accented">unto the Terrible One.</span> By "all that are round about him" the psalmist seems to mean, not Israel only, but those other oppressed ones who had shared the benefit of the deliverance (comp. ver. 9). That presents were brought by some of these is recorded by the writer of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/76-12.htm">Psalm 76:12</a></div><div class="verse">He shall cut off the spirit of princes: <i>he is</i> terrible to the kings of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall cut off the spirit of princes</span>. "The spirit" seems here to mean "the life." God cuts off princes in their prime as a gardener cuts off bunches of grapes (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He is terrible to the kings of the earth.</span> Not "princes" only - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - but "kings" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - also are cut off in their prime when God pleases. Sennacherib's untimely death (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>) followed not many years after the destruction of his host, in which there must have been many "princes." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/75.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 75"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 75" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/77.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 77"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 77" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
