<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy Name</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-33.htm">Psalm 104:33</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-2.htm">Psalm 146:2</a>). The purpose of man's creation, the end of his being, his main employment throughout eternity, is the praise of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a></div><div class="verse">My soul shall be satisfied as <i>with</i> marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise <i>thee</i> with joyful lips:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness.</span> The "marrow and fatness" of the sacrificial feasts caused a delight to worshippers, which was no doubt partly sensuous. The memory of them occurs to the psalmist, but only as the shadow and emblem of the far deeper joy and satisfaction which he finds in the spiritual worship of the Most High, and especially in the offering of praise and thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips</span>; or, <span class="accented">while my mouth praiseth thee</span> (see the Prayer book Version, which brings out the true sense).

And this is certainly true. But it is to be remembered that he views his enemies, not merely as his own fees, but as the foes of God and of Israel. As the servant of God, he must hate those who are opposed to God; as the King of Israel, he must hate those who seek to injure and ruin his people. He does not, however, desire for them suffering or torment; he only asks that they may be removed from this sphere into another world. (On David's conception of the lower world, see the comment upon <a href="../../par/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and Psalm 86:13.)
