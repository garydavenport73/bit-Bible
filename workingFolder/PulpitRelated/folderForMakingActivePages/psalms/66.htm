The passage of the Red Sea at the time of the Exodus was one of the most wonderful of God's works. To the Israelites it was altogether a matter of joy and rejoicing (see <a href="../../par/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>). But how terrible a thing was it to the Egyptians! "The waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them" (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>).

The people are called upon to praise God for a recent deliverance from a long period of severe affliction and oppression at the hand of enemies (vers. 8-12), and to join in the sacrifices which are about to be offered to God in payment of the vows made during the time of trouble (vers. 13-15). As the writer ascribes to himself both the making of the vows and the offering of the sacrifices, he must have been the leader of the nation at the time of the oppression and of the deliverance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O bless our God, ye people;</span> literally, <span class="accented">ye peoples</span> - but the plural form here can scarcely point to the "nations," who have just been called, not '<span class="accented">ammim</span>, but <span class="accented">goim</span> (see ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And make the voice of his praise to be heard</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; cf. 5).

In the old world the strict performance of vows was always held to be one of the main obligations of religion. A vow was of the nature of a compact with God, and to break it was an act of flagrant dishonesty, from which men shrank. The Mosaic Law sanctioned vows of various kinds, as the vowing of children to the service of God (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-1.htm">Leviticus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>); the vow of the Nazarite (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2-21</a>); and vows of clean or unclean animals (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-9.htm">Leviticus 27:9-13, 27-29</a>), etc. Clean animals, when vowed, must be either redeemed or sacrificed. The importance of performing vows is borne frequent witness to by the psalmists (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/65-1.htm">Psalm 65:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2</a>).

It has been because his prayers and vows proceeded from a sincere and honest heart, one which was free from "iniquity" (ver. 18). As Hengstenberg points out, this portion of the psalm is didactic, and inculcates the lesson "that there is no way of salvation except that of well doing." God, by answering the psalmist's prayer, and giving the deliverance for which he had entreated, had set his testimony to the fact of the psalmist's integrity (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come and hear, all ye that fear God.</span> The address is scarcely to all that have any sense of religion anywhere, as Professor Cheyne suggests, but rather to the religious section of his own nation - the "righteous" or "godly" of other psalms. They are invited to draw near, and be received into the psalmist's confidence. <span class="cmt_word">And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</span> What God had done for the psalmist was to give him confidence and assurance. He knew that his prayers would be ineffectual unless his heart was pure. God heard him, and then he became sure that he was free from the "great transgression" (Cheyne).
