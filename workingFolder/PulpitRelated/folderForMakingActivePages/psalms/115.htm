They scoff at the God of Israel. What, then, are their own gods? Silver and gold indeed (ver. 4), but the work of human hands. Fashioned into a human shape, as if they were sentient being - but absolutely devoid of all sense and intelligence. The satire is somewhat roughly worked out (vers. 5-7), but idolatry provokes rough speaking; and the tone here adopted is imitated in <a href="../../par/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a>, and echoed in <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>. The inspired writers seem to have felt, that, when idolatry came under consideration, the criticism should be brief and trenchant. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their idols are silver and gold</span>. At the best - often mere wood and stone (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>); but the idols of the Babylonians were mostly of the more precious materials (Herod., 1:183; <a href="../../par/daniel/3-1.htm">Daniel 3:1</a>; Ep. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4, 11</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The work of men's hands</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12-17</a>). To avoid this reproach, some images were said to have fallen down from heaven (<a href="../../par/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>).

Three several times the leader of the choir gives forth the call - " Trust in the Lord " - and three several times the choir responds with the acknowledgment that he, and he alone, "is their Help and Shield." The exhortation seems to be addressed, first, to the lay people generally (ver. 9); then to the clerical order (ver. 10); finally, to all, whether laity or clergy, who are true Israelites at heart (comp. vers. 12, 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Israel, trust thou in the Lord.</span> Follow not the example of the heathen who trust in idols.
