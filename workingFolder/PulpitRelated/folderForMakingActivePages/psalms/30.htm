Indeed, it was doubtless with some reference to the number of his foes that he wished to know how many followers he could rally to his standard in case of need. If the plague had continued much longer, David's military strength would have been seriously crippled, and his foes would have rejoiced with reason. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord my God, I cried unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee, and thou hast healed me.</span> "Heal" may be used metaphorically for the removal of mental sufferings (see <a href="../../par/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>); but David's grief when he saw the sufferings of his people from the plague seems to have wholly prostrated him, both in mind and body. For the nature of the "cry" spoken of, comp. vers. 8-10, which are an expansion of the present verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when I was on the verge of the grave, just ready to depart to the unseen world, thy interposition saved me, and brought me, as it were, back to life. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast kept me alive</span>. Lest the hyperbole of the preceding clause should be misunderstood, the writer appends a prosaic account of what had happened. God had "kept him alive" when he was in peril of death, and saved him, that he should <span class="cmt_word">not go down to the pit.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a></div><div class="verse">Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his</span>. David continually calls upon the people to join him in his praises of God. Even when the mercy vouchsafed has been granted specially to himself, he regards the people as interested, since he is their ruler in peace and their leader in war (see <a href="../../par/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>, etc.). On the present occasion, however, the people who had escaped the pestilence had almost exactly the same reason for praising and thanking God that David had, and were bound to join him in his thanksgiving service. And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness; literally, <span class="accented">give thanks to the memorial of his holiness</span>, which is explained, by reference to <a href="../../par/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, as meaning,  "Give thanks to his holy Name" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/145-21.htm">Psalm 145:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a></div><div class="verse">For his anger <i>endureth but</i> a moment; in his favour <i>is</i> life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy <i>cometh</i> in the morning.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for a moment</span> (<span class="accented">is passed</span>) <span class="accented">in his anger</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">lifetime in his favour.</span> God s anger is short-lived in the case of those who, having sinned, repent, and confess their sin, and pray for mercy (see vers. 8-10). His favour, on the contrary, is enduring; it continues all their life. Weeping may endure for a night; rather, at <span class="accented">eventide weeping comes to lodge</span>, or <span class="accented">to pass the night</span>; but joy cometh in the morning; or, <span class="accented">but at morn joy arriveth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/33-26.htm">Job 33:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a></div><div class="verse">And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-12.</span> - Now begins the expanded account of the deliverance in respect of which the thanksgiving is offered. And first, with regard to the offence that had drawn down the Divine chastisement; it was an offence of the lips, springing from an evil temper in the heart. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in my prosperity I said, I shall never</span> <span class="cmt_word">be moved;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and as for me</span>, <span class="accented">in my prosperity I said</span>, etc. There is a marked pause, and introduction of a new subject in a new strophe. Prosperity had worked an ill effect on the psalmist, had made him self-confident and proud. He "said in his heart," as the wicked man in <a href="../../par/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a>, only in still stronger phrase, "I shall not be moved;" literally, <span class="accented">I shall not be moved for</span> ever. His heart was lifted up, and in the spirit of self-glorification he gave command for the numbering of the people. The result was the plague, and the death of seventy thousand of his subjects. Into these details he does not here enter. He is content to trace his sin to its bitter root of pride, and to glance at its punishment (ver. 7) and his repentance (vers. 8-10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a></div><div class="verse">LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, <i>and</i> I was troubled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, by thy favour thou hast</span> (rather, <span class="accented">hadst</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>made my mountain to stand strong.</span> It was thy favour which had given me the "prosperity" whereby I was exalted, and which I thought rooted in myself - which had made Zion strong, and enabled me to triumph over my enemies. But, lo! suddenly all was changed - <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled</span>. God turned his face away, declared himself angry with his servant (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7-12</a>), and sent the dreadful plague which in a single day destroyed seventy thousand lives. Then David, feeling that God's face was indeed turned from him, "was troubled." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-8.htm">Psalm 30:8</a></div><div class="verse">I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1 cried to thee, O Lord; and unto thee I made supplication</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a>). The part of his prayer most honourable to David is not recorded by himself, but by the historians. He tells us of his secret wrestlings with God, his complaints and expostulations - his cries and pleadings as they remained in his memory; he passes over the desire to die for his people, which the historians put on record. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a></div><div class="verse">What profit <i>is there</i> in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit!</span> What advantage wilt thou derive from my death, if thou killest me, either by the plague, which may as well fasten upon me as upon any one else, or by the misery and mental strain of seeing my subjects, my innocent sheep, suffer? God has "no pleasure in the death of him that dieth" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>), and certainly can obtain no profit from the destruction of any of his creatures. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the dust praise thee?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). In death, so far as the power of death extends, there can be no action; the lips cease to move, and therefore cannot hymn God's praise - the "dust" is inanimate, and, while it remains dust, cannot speak. What the freed soul may do, the psalmist does not consider. Very little was known under the old dispensation concerning the intermediate state. <span class="cmt_word">Shall it declare thy truth?</span> The dust certainly could not do this, unless revivified and formed into another living body. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a></div><div class="verse">Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my Helper</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/54-4.htm">Psalm 54:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-6.htm">Hebrews 13:6</a>). Here the psalmist's prayer, uttered in his distress, ends, and he proceeds to declare the result. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast turned</span> (rather, <span class="accented">thou turnedst</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for me my mourning into dancing</span>. Suddenly, in a moment, all was changed. The angel ceased to slay. God bade him hold his hand. The Prophet Gad was sent with the joyful news to David, and commanded him at once to build an altar at Jehovah. Then the mourning ceased, and a joyful ceremonial was instituted, of which dancing, as so often, formed a part (see <a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">put off</span> (rather, <span class="accented">didst put off</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my sackcloth</span>. That the king had clothed himself in sackcloth on the occasion, is mentioned by the author of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>). And girded (<span class="accented">girdedst</span>) me with gladness (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-12.htm">Psalm 30:12</a></div><div class="verse">To the end that <i>my</i> glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee</span>. If we allow the ellipse of the personal pronoun supposed by our translators and Revisers, we must regard David as calling his soul "his glory," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>. But some commentators think that "glory" is here used as we use "royalty," and designates the  royal person or the royal office (so Kay and Professor Alexander). <span class="cmt_word">And not be silent. O</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</span> Great mercies deserve perpetual remembrance. David regarded the mercy at this time vouchsafed him as one which, like that vouchsafed Hezekiah, required to be commemorated "all the days of his life" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/29.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 29"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 29" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/31.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 31"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 31" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
