The psalmist speaks, not absolute truth, but the belief of his day - a belief which vanished when life and immortality were brought to light by the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And they are out off from thy hand;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> severed from thee, shut up in a place where thou dwell eat not (see <a href="../../par/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>).

It is some severe stroke of illness which has brought him to his last gasp. The "lowest pit" is here metaphorical - the deepest depth of calamity. <span class="cmt_word">In darkness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in darknesses</span>, where no ray of thy favour shines upon me. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the deeps</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>, "deep waters, where the floods overflow him").

It may be suspected that the psalmist's affliction was of a kind which made him "unclean." <span class="cmt_word">I am shut up.</span> Not in prison, as Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-5.htm">Jeremiah 36:5</a>), but probably as unclean, or as suspected of Being unclean (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4-33</a>).

The word <span class="accented">rephaim</span> designates the wan, shadowy ghosts that have gone down to Hades (Sheol), and are resting there. Shall these suddenly rise up and engage in the worship and praise of God? The psalmist does not, any more than Job (Job 14:14), expect such a resurrection. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a></div><div class="verse">Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? <i>or</i> thy faithfulness in destruction?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave?</span> Wilt thou wait till I am in my grave before thou showest any mercy upon me? or, Will not that be too late? <span class="cmt_word">Can thy faithfulness to thy promises be shown in destruction?</span> literally, <span class="accented">in Abaddon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "perdition" - a name of Sheol (cf. <a href="../../par/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-22.htm">Job 28:22</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/88-13.htm">Psalm 88:13</a></div><div class="verse">But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But unto thee have I cried, O Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but as for me, to thee have I cried.</span> The psalmist returns from the somewhat vague speculations of vers. 10-12 to fact and to himself. He is not yet a mere shade, an inhabitant of Sheol; he is in the flesh, upon the earth; he can still cry, and does still cry, to Jehovah. There is thus still a faint gleam of hope for him. <span class="cmt_word">And in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</span> The psalmist will draw out God's mercy, as it were, before its time, by importuning him with early and continual prayer (comp. vers. 1, 9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a></div><div class="verse">LORD, why castest thou off my soul? <i>why</i> hidest thou thy face from me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, why cutest thou off my soul?</span> The psalmist speaks here, like Job, as one aggrieved. What has he done to be "cast off"? He is evidently not aware of having sinned any grievous sin, and does not understand why he is visited with such grievous sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">Why hidest thou thy face from me?</span> Perhaps it is his insensibility, his unconsciousness of real sins and shortcomings, that has drawn down upon the psalmist his chastisement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/88-15.htm">Psalm 88:15</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am</i> afflicted and ready to die from <i>my</i> youth up: <i>while</i> I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up</span>. This is a new point. The psalmist's afflictions have not come upon him recently. He does not merely mean, as some have supposed, that, like other men, as soon as he was born he began to die, but speaks of something, if not absolutely peculiar to himself, yet at any rate rare and abnormal - a long continuance in a dying state, such as could only have been brought about by some terribly severe malady. <span class="cmt_word">While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I have endured thy terrors</span>; <span class="accented">I am exhausted.</span> (On the endurance of God's "terrors," see <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>.) The natural result would be a state, not of distraction, but of exhaustion. (So Kay, and substantially Professor Cheyne.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/88-16.htm">Psalm 88:16</a></div><div class="verse">Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy fierce wrath goeth over me.</span> "Overwhelms me;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "like a fiery flood" (see above, ver. 7). Thy terrors have cut me off. A different word is used for "terrors" from that which occurs in ver. 15, and one elsewhere occurring only in <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>. The verb also is one characteristic of Job (Job 6:17; 23:17), and means "extinguish," or "exterminate."
