From this opening phrase, which finds an echo in vers. 2 and 6, this psalm has been called "The Invitatory Psalm." As it invited the Jews, so it now invites Christian congregations, to join in the worship of the sanctuary. <span class="cmt_word">Let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a>). Loudness of voice was regarded as indicating earnestness of heart (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-19.htm">2 Chronicles 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-13.htm">Ezra 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-42.htm">Nehemiah 12:42</a>, etc.). The expression, "Rock of our salvation" is taken from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-47.htm">2 Samuel 22:47</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-26.htm">Psalm 89:26</a>). It is well paraphrased in our Prayer book Version, "the <span class="accented">strength</span> of our salvation."

This word, standing prominently forward as it does, is a startling call, intimating that the time is come for a momentous decision. <span class="cmt_word">If ye will hear his voice.</span> God is crying to his people - will they hear, or will they forbear? If the former, all will go well; if the latter, than assuredly they shall not enter into his rest. The "voice" intended proceeds to give the warning of vers. 8-11.
