The judgment seems to be adjourned, or to be left to the conscience of the defendants." The faithful are summoned, and appear, but not to receive unqualified commendation (see <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-40</a>). Rather they receive a warning. The strong and prolonged depreciation of sacrifice (vers. 8-13) necessarily implies that in the religion of the time too much stress was laid upon it. We know that, in the heathen world, men sought to buy God's favour by their sacrifices, some] believing that, physically, the gods were nourished by the steam of the victims, others regarding them as laid under obligations which they could not disregard (Plato, 'Rep.,' it. &sect; 6; Rawlinson, 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 124, 125). We know, too, that, in the later monarchy, sacrifice to so great an extent superseded true spiritual worship among the Israelites themselves, that it became an offence to God, and was spoken of in terms of reprobation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). Already, it would seem, this tendency was manifesting itself, and a warning from Heaven was needed against it<span class="cmt_word">.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O my people, and I will speak</span>. God will not speak to deaf ears. Unless men are ready to attend to him, he keeps silence<span class="cmt_word">.

Not only have the daily morning and evening sacrifices been regularly offered, and the national worship thus kept up without a break; but the private offerings of individuals (see vers. 9, 13) have been continuous and ample in number. But they have not been acceptable.

So the Revised Version, Dr. Kay, Canon Cook, the Four Friends, and others; but many critics regard such a rendering as impossible. Of these, some translate, "And the cattle upon the hills, where there are thousands" (Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, etc.); while others read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5e4;</span>, and render, "And the cattle upon the mountains of God" (Olshausen, Cheyne).

Scarcely did even the grossest of the heathen take this view. A vapour, an odour (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>), was thought to ascend from the victims sacrificed, and this penetrated to the Olympian abodes, and gratified, or, as some would say, "fed" the gods.

They claim the privileges of God's covenanted servants (ver. 16), but perform none of the duties (vers. 17-20), thus bringing down upon themselves a terrible menace. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</span> The wicked assumed that they were true Israelites.

They claimed the right of enforcing them against others (<a href="../../par/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18-20</a>), while in their own persons they set them at nought (vers. 18-20). God declares that they have no right to assume to be teachers of others until they have taught themselves - they are unfit even to "take his covenant in their mouth."

God tests his professed, but really disobedient, servants by the second table of the Decalogue, and finds them wanting.

But now the time is come when I shall no longer keep silence; I shall openly "reprove" thee, and marshal in set order before thee all the wicked deeds which thou hast done.

To "tear in pieces" is the act of a wild beast (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>).

Certainly, if God, in his anger, lays hold upon a man to punish him, there is no possible deliverance at the hand of any other man (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7, 8</a>).
