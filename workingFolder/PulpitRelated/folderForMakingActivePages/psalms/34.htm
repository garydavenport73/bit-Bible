If the statement in the title may be relied upon, David's fortunes were now at the lowest ebb. He had fled from the court of Saul on finding that Saul was determined to put him to death (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a>). He had hoped to find a safe refuge with Achish, but had been disappointed. He was on the point of becoming a fugitive and an outlaw, a dweller in dens and caves of the earth  (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>). He had as yet no body of followers. We cannot but admire his piety in composing, at such a time, a song of thanksgiving to God. <span class="cmt_word">His praise shall continually be in my mouth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/92-1.htm">Psalm 92:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/145-1.htm">Psalm 145:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-1.htm">Psalm 146:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>). "Continually" must be understood as meaning either "every day" or "many times every day," but must not be taken quite literally, or the business of life would be at a stand.

Not content with praising God in his own person, the psalmist calls on Israel generally to praise the Lord with him. He then proceeds to assign reasons why God should be praised (vers. 4-10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a></div><div class="verse">I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I sought the Lord, and he heard me.</span> To "seek the Lord" is not merely to trust in him, but to fly to him, and make our requests of him in our troubles. David apparently speaks of some special occasion on which he "sought the Lord," and some special request which he made of him, but does not tell us what the occasion or request was. We may presume that it was in some way connected with his "escape to the cave Adullam" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And delivered me from all my fears;</span> literally, frown <span class="accented">all the things which I feared</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a>).

Almost a repetition of ver. 4, but in the third person instead of the first. The "poor man" intended is David him* self, not an ideal poor man. Otherwise the demonstrative "this" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) would not have been employed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a></div><div class="verse">The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel of the Lord eneampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them</span>. According to some commentators (Rosenmuller, 'Four Friends,' and others), the expression, "angel of the Lord," is here used as a collective, and means the angels generally. With this certainly agrees the statement that the angel "encampeth <span class="accented">round about</span> them that fear him;" and the illustration from <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14-18</a> is thus exactly apposite. But others deny that "the angel of the Lord" has ever a collective sense, and think a single personality must necessarily* be intended, which they regard as identical with "the captain of the Lord's host," who appeared to Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14, 15</a>), and "the angel of the Lord's presence" spoken of by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>); so Kay, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Professor Alexander, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' When pressed to say how this one angel can "encamp round" a number of persons, they reply that, of course, he has his subordinates with him - a "spangled host," that "keep watch in squadrons bright;" and that he is said to do what they do, which is no doubt quite in accordance with ordinary modes of speech. Thus, however, the two expositions become nearly identical, since, according to both, it is the angelic host which "encamps around" the faithful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a></div><div class="verse">O taste and see that the LORD <i>is</i> good: blessed <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> trusteth in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O taste</span> <span class="cmt_word">and see that the Lord is</span> <span class="cmt_word">good;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> put the matter to the test of experience (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-3.htm">1 Peter 2:3</a>). There is no other way of really knowing how good God is. Blessed is the man that trusteth in him (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7</a>). Trust in God is a feeling which is blessed in itself. God also showers blessings on such as trust in him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/34-9.htm">Psalm 34:9</a></div><div class="verse">O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for <i>there is</i> no want to them that fear him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O fear the Lord, ye his saints</span>. Fear of God, a reverent and godly fear, will always accompany trust in God, such as God approves. The saints of God both love and fear him (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>). There is no want to them that fear 'him since God supplies all their wants.

Some suppose the "young lions" here to represent the proud and violent, as in <a href="../../par/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>. But it is simpler to take the present passage literally. In God's animal creation even the strongest suffer want for a time, and have no remedy; his human creatures need never be in want, <span class="cmt_word">since they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing</span>. It is open to them to "seek the Lord" at any time.

The writer assumes the <span class="accented">role</span> of the teacher, and, addressing his readers as "sons," undertakes to "teach them the fear of the Lord" (ver, 11), or, in other words, to point out to them in what true religion consists. This he does in two remarkable verses (vers. 13, 14); after which he proceeds, in the  remainder of the psalm, to give reasons which may incline them to the practice of it (vers. 15-22). The reasons resolve themselves into two main grounds - the tender love and care of God for the righteous (vers. 15, 17-20, 22), and his hostility to and punishment of the wicked (vers. 16, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come, ye children, hearken unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-32.htm">Proverbs 8:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach you the fear of the Lord;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will teach you the nature of true religion.

If the end be happiness, the means will be right moral conduct; and, first of all, right government of the tongue. Sins of the tongue are numerous, and abundantly noted in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-7.htm">Psalm 10:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/15-3.htm">Psalm 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-19.htm">Psalm 50:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-8.htm">Psalm 73:8, 9</a>, etc.). They are more difficult to avoid than any others; they cling closer to us; they are scarcely ever wholly laid aside. "If any man offend not in word, the same is a <span class="accented">perfect</span> man, and able also to bridle the whole body" (<a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). The meek Moses "spake unadvisedly with his lips" (<a href="../../par/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a>). Job "darkened counsel by words without knowledge "(<a href="../../par/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2</a>). St. Peter's words on one occasion drew upon him the rebuke, "Get thee behind me, Satan" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-23.htm">Matthew 16:23</a>).

First, he enjoins negative goodness - "depart from evil," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do nothing that is wrong; break no laws of God, no command of conscience; have a conscience void of offence, both towards God and towards man. Secondly, he requires positive goodness - "Do good;" i.e. actively perform the will of God from the heart; discharge every duty; practise every virtue; carry out the precepts of the moral law in every particular. <span class="cmt_word">Seek peace, and pursue it.</span> It is not clear why this virtue - one of many - is specially enjoined; but probably some circumstances of the time made the recommendation advisable.

The specific statement of ver. 6 is now generalized. What God had done in the case of the psalmist, he will do in all other similar cases. His eyes will be open to his people's needs, and his ears attent unto their prayers (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-40.htm">2 Chronicles 6:40</a>).

"We must through mush tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" (<a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>).

And the <span class="accented">verb</span> used means primarily, as Dr. Kay says, "to sever," then "to set free, release, emancipate; especially to set free by paying a price; to redeem, or ransom." <span class="cmt_word">And none of them that trust in him shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be desolate;</span> rather, <span class="accented">shall be held guilty</span>, or <span class="accented">shall be condemned</span> - <span class="accented">the</span> same word as in the preceding verse (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33, 34</a>). Those whom God has redeemed he justifies, and saves from all condemnation. They are "passed from death unto life" (<a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/33.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 33"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 33" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/35.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 35"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 35" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
