The first danger is from secret plots, which David knows to be going on against his authority (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-12</a>). The second, and greater danger, will be from open insurrection (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-14</a>).

Calumny was what David especially feared, and what actually brought about his downfall (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2-6</a>). The "bitterness" of his enemies is further emphasized by the speeches and curses of Shimei (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/64-4.htm">Psalm 64:4</a></div><div class="verse">That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may shoot in secret at the perfect;</span> or, <span class="accented">in their hiding places</span>. David does not scruple to call himself "perfect," using the word in the sense in which it is used of Job (<a href="../../par/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>), meaning a sincere and upright man. <span class="cmt_word">Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</span> They are not afraid, though it is "the anointed of the Lord," whom to attack is not only rebellion, but sacrilege (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>).

We do not know the exact proceedings of his enemies against David at the time, the narrative of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a> being so brief; but it was probably by some trickery that David was induced to quit the stronghold of Jerusalem, and so yield the seat of government, and many other advantages, to his rival. <span class="cmt_word">They say, Who shall see them?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>). It is an inveterate folly for men to imagine, either that God will not see their actions, or that he will pay no heed to them. A spurious humility is brought into play in the latter case - How can it be supposed that God will note the doings of such worms as men?

So modern critics generally (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, Canon Cook, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.</span> Therefore the righteous man is in great danger from them, unless God interpose.

Men shall perceive God's hand in it, and shall be led, in consequence, to declare "God's work." The tragic ends of Ahithophel and Absalom were certainly well calculated to impress the minds of men generally, and to strike awe into the hearts of those who had looked with indifference, or even, perhaps, with satisfaction, on the political troubles. <span class="cmt_word">For they shall wisely consider of his doing;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for they shall understand his operation</span>.
