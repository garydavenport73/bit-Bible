Some imagine a pit with rushing water at the bottom of it, but such pits are scarcely known in Palestine. Others a pit which is filled with noise as a warrior, with crash of arms and amid the shouts of enemies, falls into it. But pits, though used in hunting, were not employed in warfare. The explanation that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> here is to be taken in the secondary sense of "destruction" or "misery," seems to me preferable (see the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of the miry</span> <span class="cmt_word">clay</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2, 14</a>).

Mercy and praise are cause and effect. The deliverance recorded in ver. 2 produces the praise of vers. 3-5. The phrase, "our God," shows us how David instinctively identifies himself with his people. A mercy shown to him is one shown to them. <span class="cmt_word">Many shall see it, and fear</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-13.htm">Deuteronomy 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-20.htm">Deuteronomy 19:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-21.htm">Deuteronomy 21:21</a>, where the phrase, "all Israel shall hear and fear," is used of the effect produced by the capital punishment of a high-handed transgressor of the Law). There may be an allusion here to Absalom's end, which was probably followed by a certain number of executions<span class="cmt_word">. And shall trust in the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall have their faith in God strengthened.

God's mercies in the past have been countless, and have laid him under unspeakable obligations. <span class="cmt_word">And thy thoughts which are to us-ward</span>. God's thoughtfulness for man, his consideration and providential care, deserve praise and thanks equally with his wondrous acts. <span class="cmt_word">They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee</span>. They are so numerous that it is impossible to reckon them up. Many of them, moreover, are secret, and escape our notice. <span class="cmt_word">If I would declare and speak of them. they are more than can be numbered</span>. Words, therefore, are insufficient; and some better return than mere words must be found. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a></div><div class="verse">Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire</span>. Will the right return be by sacrifices and burnt offerings? No, the psalmist answers to himself; it is not these which God really "desires." Samuel had already preached the doctrine, "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). David goes further. Apart from a spirit of obedience, sacrifice and offering are not desired or required at all; rather, as Isaiah says, they are a weariness and an abomination (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11, 12</a>). The one thing needed is obedience - a cheerful, willing obedience to all that God reveals as his will. <span class="cmt_word">Mine ears hast thou opened</span>. Either, "Thou hast taken away my deafness, and given me ears open to receive and embrace thy Law;" or, perhaps, with special reference to <a href="../../par/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-17.htm">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>, "Thou hast accepted me as thy voluntary servant, and bored through mine ear, to mark that I am thy servant for ever." <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required</span>. Of the four kinds of offering mentioned in this verse, the first (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d1;&#x5d7;</span>) is the ordinary offering of a victim at the altar in sacrifice; the second (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>), the meat offering of flour, with oil and frankincense accompanying it; the third (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>) is the "whole burnt offering," representative of complete self-sacrifice; and the fourth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>), the "sin offering," or "trespass offering," of which the special intention was expiation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book <i>it is</i> written of me,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">then said I</span>, <span class="accented">Lo</span>, <span class="accented">I come with the roll of the book written concerning me.</span> "Then" means "as soon as my ears were opened." "Lo, I come," marks ready and prompt obedience (see <a href="../../par/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-20.htm">2 Samuel 19:20</a>). The psalmist represents himself as brining with him "the roll of the book," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the book of the Law in its ordinary form of a parchment roll, to show what it is that he is prepared to obey. This book, he says, is written "concerning him," since it contains precepts concerning a king's duties (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>).  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a></div><div class="verse">I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law <i>is</i> within my heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy Law is within my heart.</span> The obedience to be rendered will be a true and acceptable obedience, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> cheerful, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Consciously or unconsciously, David speaks as the type of Christ (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-9.htm">Psalm 40:9</a></div><div class="verse">I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have preached righteousness in the great congregation</span>: rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have proclaimed righteousness.</span> David has sung the praises of God in the "great congregation," and extolled his righteousness and truth (<a href="../../par/psalms/35-18.htm">Psalm 35:18</a>). He has not "preached," in the modern sense of the word, since the preaching office was reserved for the priests and Levites. Lo, I have not refrained my lips; or, <span class="accented">I will not refrain my lips.</span> I will continue to glorify thee openly, and praise thy Name while I have my being (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-33.htm">Psalm 104:33</a>). O Lord, thou knowest; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou knowest the truth of my statement as to the past, and the sincerity of my promise as to the future. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a></div><div class="verse">I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation</span>. David's psalms furnish a running commentary on these statements. Composed, as appears from the titles, mainly for use in the "great congregation," they set forth the righteousness, faithfulness, salvation, loving-kindness, and truth of God in the strongest possible way. Contemporary Israel, and later Israel, and the Church which has succeeded to the place of the original Israelites, and become "the Israel of God," are alike indebted to him for the wonderful strains in which he has shown forth and magnified these qualities of the Almighty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a></div><div class="verse">Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord</span>. The supplicatory portion of the psalm here commences. David beseeches God, whose loving-kindness is so great (ver. 10), not to withhold <span class="accented">from him</span> those "tender mercies" which he lavishes so freely. As he is bent on "not withholding," or "refraining," his lips (ver. 9), so it is fitting that God should not "withhold," or "refrain" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>) his kindness. <span class="cmt_word">Let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me</span> (compare the last clause of ver. 10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-12.htm">Psalm 40:12</a></div><div class="verse">For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For innumerable evils have compassed me about</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for evils have gathered upon me until there is no</span> number (comp. vers. 1, 2). The exact nature of the "evils" is not mentioned; but the worst of them appears to be "the deep and bitter consciousness of sin" revealed in the next clause. Another was, beyond all doubt, the continued animosity of enemies (ver. 14). Mental and bodily weakness may have been added, and have completed the crushing load whereof complaint is made. It is noted that the exceedingly deep consciousness of sin here displayed "belongs altogether to a late part of David's life" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not</span> <span class="cmt_word">able to look up;</span> rather, <span class="accented">so that</span> 1 <span class="accented">am not able to see.</span> An actual failure of sight seems to be intended (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>; 28:10). <span class="cmt_word">They are more than the hairs</span> <span class="cmt_word">of my head;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are more in number. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore my heart faileth me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my courage" and "my strength of mind" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-10.htm">Psalm 38:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a></div><div class="verse">Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver us</span>. Though one deliverance is just effected (ver. 2), it is not enough; something more is required. The psalmist's life is still threatened by enemies (ver. 14); he is still scoffed at and flouted (ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, make haste to help me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Lord</span>, <span class="accented">make haste to my help</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-19.htm">Psalm 22:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>). The Church follows the example set, when she says in her versicles, "O God, make speed to save us. O Lord, make haste to help us."

Whether the detachment was the work of David or another, is uncertain. The differences between the two versions are slight (see the comment on Psalm 70.). The present verse repeats almost exactly <a href="../../par/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a> and 26. It is again repeated, with slight variations, in <a href="../../par/psalms/71-13.htm">Psalm 71:13</a>.
