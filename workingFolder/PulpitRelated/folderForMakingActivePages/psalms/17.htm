Here and elsewhere the psalmist assumes that right is on his side, and that he is persecuted unjustly. Unless he had been convinced of this, he could not have called on God to vindicate him. The narrative in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18</a>. - 27, fully justifies his conviction. Attend unto my cry (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>). <span class="accented">Rinnah</span>, the word translated "cry" here (and in <a href="../../par/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>) is a strong term: it means "shout," "outcry"  - most often, though not here, "a shout of joy." <span class="cmt_word">Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips;</span> rather, <span class="accented">feigning lips</span>, or <span class="accented">guileful lips</span> - <span class="accented">lips</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that speak falsehood knowingly</span>.

David does not doubt, any more than Job (<a href="../../par/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>), what the sentence will be. As right is on his side (ver. 1), it must be in his favour. <span class="cmt_word">Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Let thine eyes behold equities.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited <i>me</i> in the night; thou hast tried me, <i>and</i> shalt find nothing; I am purposed <i>that</i> my mouth shall not transgress.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast proved mine heart</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23</a>). "Proved" means "tried," "tested," examined strictly, so as to know whether there was any wickedness in it or not. Thou hast visited me in the night. The night is the time when men can least escape those searching, testing thoughts which God's providence then especially sends, to "try the very heart and reins" (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast tried me., and shalt find nothing;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and findest nothing.</span> The process was one begun in the past, and continuing on in the present. God was ever searching David and trying him; but "found nothing," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no alloy, no base rectal, no serious flaw in his character; not that he was sinless, but that he 'was sincere and earnest - a true worshipper of God, not a hypocrite. <span class="cmt_word">I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</span> "If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man" (<a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). David's resolution to "keep the door of his lips" would have a chastening influence over both his thoughts and acts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/17-4.htm">Psalm 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept <i>me from</i> the paths of the destroyer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the works of man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "with respect to the actions of ordinary life " - here called "the works of Adam" ? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the natural man<span class="cmt_word">.

So De Wette and Rosenmuller; but most recent critics prefer to consider the words as an assertion rather than a prayer, and translate, "My steps have held fast to thy paths: [therefore] my feet have not been moved" (Kay, Hengstenberg, Alexander, Cheyne, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/17-6.htm">Psalm 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, <i>and hear</i> my speech.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God</span> (comp. vers. 1, 2). Having established, as the ground of his claim to be heard of God, his own sincerity, steadfastness, and virtuous course in life (vers. 3-5), David now recurs to his original intent, and resumes his "prayer." He is sure that God will hear him, since his prayer is grounded on "right." <span class="cmt_word">Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/71-2.htm">Psalm 71:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-2.htm">Psalm 88:2</a>, etc.).

It is uncertain to which clause of the sentence the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span> belongs. Its position seems to attach it rather to those who resist God than to those who trust in him. See the marginal version, which has, O <span class="accented">thou that savest them which trust in thee from those that rise up against thy right hand.</span> But the rendering in the text of the Authorized Version is preferred by most writers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a></div><div class="verse">Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep me as the apple of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the eye</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>. ]0, where the same simile is used). Here, however, the expression employed is still more tender and more practical: "Keep me," says David," as the apple, <span class="accented">daughter of the eye."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hide me under the shadow of thy wings</span>. This seems also to be a reminiscence of Deuteronomy, where, after the mention of the "apple of the eye," the water continues, As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11, 12</a>; comp. further <a href="../../par/psalms/36-7.htm">Psalm 36:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>).

When hunted by Saul upon the mountains,  David was often "compassed about" with foes (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14, 15, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>).

Self-indulgence has hardened their feelings and dulled their souls. An organ enclosed in fat cannot work freely. So their feelings cannot work as nature intended through the coarseness and hardness in which they are, as it were, embedded. <span class="cmt_word">With their mouth they speak proudly</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a>).

As the lion, before making his spring, fixes his eyes intently upon the prey  - not to fascinate it, but to make sure of his distance - with intent, when he springs, to cast the prey down to the earth; so it is now with my enemies, who have set their eyes on me.

Having described the character of the wicked man, and pointed out his ill desert (vers. 9-12), the psalmist now invokes God's vengeance upon him.
