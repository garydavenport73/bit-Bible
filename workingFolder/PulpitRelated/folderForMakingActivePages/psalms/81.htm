As, however, the chief blowing of trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>), most commentators regard the psalm as composed for this occasion. There are some, however, as Hengstenberg, Professor Cheyne, and Professor Alexander, who consider it to be a Passover psalm. <span class="cmt_word">In the time appointed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">at the full moon; i.e.</span> on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the Feast of Tabernacles was opened (see <a href="../../par/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a>).

Professor Cheyne explains, "God appointed the Law to be valid in northern as well as southern Israel." Hengstenberg and Professor Alexander account for the expression by the pre-eminence of Joseph during the sojourn in Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">When he went out through the land of Egypt</span>. When he (Joseph) went out over (or, across) the land," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the time of the Exodus. <span class="cmt_word">Where I heard a language that I understood not.</span> It can scarcely be supposed that this clause belongs properly  to ver. 5. It is rather an introduction to the monody wherewith the psalm (as it has come down to us) concludes - the mournful complaint of God against his people. So Professor Cheyne, who translates, "The discourse of no whom I had not known (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of God) did I hear." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a></div><div class="verse">I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-16.</span> - The "discourse" is now given. It commences somewhat abruptly, and is, perhaps, itself a fragment, the beginning of which is lost. God reminds Israel of his past favours (vers. 6, 7), exhorts them to faithfulness (vers. 8, 9), promises them blessings (ver. 10), complains of their waywardness (vers. 11, 12), and finally makes a last appeal to them to turn to him, and recover his protection, before it is too late (vers. 13-16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I removed his shoulder from the burden.</span> In Egypt, burdens were borne upon the shoulder, either simply held upon it with both hands, or distributed between the two shoulders by means of a yoke (see Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 214). <span class="cmt_word">His hands were delivered from the pots;</span> rather, <span class="accented">from the basket; i.e.</span> the basket in which the clay was carried before it was made into bricks.

In this, and from this, God answered the cry of his people (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I proved thee at the waters of Meribah</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>). The "selah" after these words marks a pause, during which the people addressed might reflect on the manifold mercies which God had vouchsafed to them in Egypt, in the wilderness, and elsewhere.

Israel is still "God's people," however rebellious (vers. 11, 12).

God's gifts, both temporal and spiritual, are proportioned to our eager longing for them. As Christ could not do his miracles in one place because of their unbelief (<a href="../../par/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5, 6</a>), so God cannot give lavishly unless we desire largely. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a></div><div class="verse">But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But my people would not hearken to my voice</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10, 41, 56</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-14.htm">2 Kings 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Israel would none of me;</span> literally, <span class="accented">would not obey me</span> (see the Prayer book Version).

After a time, if they persist in evil courses and disobedience to his commands, he "gives them up," withdraws from them, leaves them to themselves, to the "lust," or rather "stubbornness" of their own hearts - to their own perverse wills and imaginations. <span class="cmt_word">And they walked in their own counsels</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>). This result is inevitable. If God no longer guides their thoughts and enlightens their understandings, they can but follow their own foolish counsels, and the result cannot but be disastrous.
