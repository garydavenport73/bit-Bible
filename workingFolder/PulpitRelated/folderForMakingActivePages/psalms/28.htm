Originally, the idea probably was that the hands should be ready to receive the blessings which God would bestow. But, later on, the lifting up of the hands seems to have been regarded as symbolizing the lifting up of the heart (<a href="../../par/lamentations/3-41.htm">Lamentations 3:41</a>). Towards thy holy oracle (see the comment on Psalm 5:7).

The metaphor implied  in "draw me not away "is that of a hunter, drawing prey of all kinds to him enclosed within a net. The psalmist prays that he may not share the fate of the workers of iniquity, over whom he seems to see some terrible judgment impending. <span class="cmt_word">Which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.</span> (For extreme instances of this kind of wickedness, see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9, 10</a>; and for the wide prevalence of such treacherous dealing, comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a>.)

The feeling of righteous indignation, naturally implanted in us, causes us to desire the punishment of the wicked, quite apart from any wrong that they may have done to ourselves (Aristotle, 'Rhet.,' 2:1, &sect; 3). Give them after the work of their hands: <span class="cmt_word">render to them their desert</span>.

David shows in both respects a moral nature uncorrupted by contact with the world of his day.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/28-6.htm">Psalm 28:6</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - As, midway in <a href="../../par/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>, the tone changed from jubilation to humble entreaty, so, midway in the present psalm, there is a change from plaintive and humble entreaty to rejoicing and thanksgiving. The cause of the change would seem to have been a confident assurance, arising out of the very act of prayer, that the prayer is heard and granted, so that the happy results prayed for are certain to follow. Such an assurance is certainly not attained by all those whose supplications are earnest and devout; but David appears to have enjoyed it not infrequently (see above, <a href="../../par/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8-10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications</span> (comp. ver. 2, with which this is, of set purpose, made exactly to correspond). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is my Strength and my Shield</span> (see <a href="../../par/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-114.htm">Psalm 119:114</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My heart trusted in him, and I am helped</span>. As far as feeling goes, David is already "helped." He <span class="accented">feels</span> himself delivered out of his peril. Therefore, he says, my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song - literally, <span class="accented">out of my song</span>, which is explained to mean "out of my store of song" - will I praise him. He is ready to offer thanksgiving for a mercy not yet received.

The deliverance will be as much for their sake as for his. <span class="cmt_word">And he is the saving strength of his anointed</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and a Stronghold of salvation to his anointed is</span> HE. The welfare of David and that of the people are bound up together. God strengthens him for their sakes, that he may guide them aright and fight their battles, and give them dominion over their enemies. It was with this object that he chose him out of all Israel, and took him from the sheepfolds, and had him anointed king - that he might "feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a></div><div class="verse">Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Save thy people, and bless thins inheritance</span>. "In conclusion, the psalmist prays that the Lord would do eternally that which he had done now" (Hengstenberg) - "save" and "bless" his people  - keep them from evil, and give them all that is good. Feed them also. As a shepherd does his flock (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1, 2</a>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>). And lift them up for ever. Some explain the" lifting up" as carrying in his arms over rough places - a prolongation of the shepherd metaphor (Kay; 'Speaker's Commentary'); but, perhaps, the more ordinary meaning of the Hebrew word - "exalt," "lift up on high," "raise above others" - which is preferred by Bishop Horsley, Rosenmuller, and Hengstenberg, is intended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/27.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 27"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 27" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/29.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 29"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 29" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
