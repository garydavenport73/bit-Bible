God has recently dealt with Israel exceptionally - has seemed to "cast them off," has "put them to shame," allowed them to be defeated and despoiled, slain and carried into captivity, made a scorn and a derision, a reproach and a byword. He no longer "goes forth with their armies," to secure them victory over their foes, but holds aloof, and covers them with confusion. The description implies, not a single defeat, but a somewhat prolonged period of depression, during which several "armies" have been beaten, several battles lost, multitudes slain, and great numbers carried away captive (ver. 11). Still, a general captivity, like the Babylonian, is certainly not spoken cf. The nation is as yet unconquered. It needs but a return of God's favour to turn the vanquished into the victors, and to replace shame by boasting. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">cast off</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and put us to shame</span> (see also ver. 16). It is the <span class="accented">shame</span> of defeat, rather than the physical pains or material losses, that grieve the writer<span class="cmt_word">. And goest not forth with our armies</span>. Israel has still "armies" at her disposal. It is therefore certainly not the early Maccabean period, nor the time of the expiring monarchy. Her armies have free play, are sent forth, only God does not "go forth" with them (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/60-10.htm">Psalm 60:10</a>).

There are not many periods of Israelite history at which such a description could have been given without manifest untruth, and the time of David is certainly more suitable for it than almost any other.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant</span>. Israel had neither put aside the thought of religion, and given herself up to wordliness, nor yet, while still professedly religious, transgressed habitually God's commandments. She maintained "thorough sincerity in religion, and consistent integrity of life." Yet "all this" - all that has been described in vers. 9-16 - had come upon her.

If Israel had either forgotten the true God (see above, ver. 17) or fallen away to the worship of false or strange gods - then her ill success against her foreign enemies would have been fully accounted for, since it would only have been in accordance with the threatenings of the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-23</a>); but as she had done neither of these things, her defeats and depressed condition seemed to the psalmist wholly unaccountable. We trace here the same current belief, which comes out so strongly in the Book of Job - the belief that calamities were, almost of necessity, punishments for sin; and that when they occurred, and there had been no known precedent misconduct, the case was abnormal and extraordinary.

Not only are the Israelites not suffering on account of any previous desertion of God, or other misconduct, but they are suffering for their fidelity to God. The heathen hate them, and make war upon them, as worshippers of one exclusive God, Jehovah, and contemners of their many gods, whom they hold to be "no-gods." They are martyrs, like the Christians of the early Church (see <a href="../../par/romans/8-36.htm">Romans 8:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We</span> <span class="cmt_word">are counted as sheep for the slaughter</span> (comp. ver. 11).

God has always hitherto maintained the cause of his people, and given them victory over their enemies, unless they had fallen away from him (vers. 1-8). Now he has acted otherwise - he has allowed their enemies to triumph (vers. 9-16). And they have given him no reason for his desertion of them (vers. 17-22). Surely, if they call upon him, and plead their cause before him, he will relent, and come to their aid. The appeal, therefore, is made briefly, but in the most moving terms. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?</span> The psalmist does not really believe that Jehovah "sleeps." The heathen might so imagine of their gods (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), but not an Israelite. An Israelite would be sure that "he that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps" (<a href="../../par/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>).
