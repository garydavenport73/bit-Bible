God is really on their side, though he may seem for a time to favour the wicked. (On the need of a pure heart, see <a href="../../par/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>.)

He feels now that his doubt had been a sin, and had almost caused him to give up his confidence and trust in the Almighty. He had well nigh slipped from the rock of faith into the abyss of scepticism.

To envy the wicked because they prosper is to make more account of the good things of this life than of God's favour - to prefer physical good to moral. It is also to doubt that God governs the universe by the strict rule of justice. The word translated "foolish" means rather, "vain arrogant boasters." Such the wicked commonly become when they prosper (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>).

Such deaths often happen, and are a severe trial of faith to those who have no firm conviction of the reality of a hereafter. <span class="cmt_word">But their strength is firm;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their body is plump</span> (Cheyne). But the Authorized Version probably gives the true meaning. They drop into the grave while their strength is still undiminished.

There is, no doubt, something of Oriental hyperbole in this representation, as there is in the account given by Job (<span class="accented">l</span>.<span class="accented">s.c.</span>), which he afterwards qualifies (<a href="../../par/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13-23</a>). But still a certain immunity from suffering does seem often to attach to the wicked man, whom God does not chasten, because chastening would be of no service to him.

Not being afflicted, they regard themselves as favourites of Heaven, and are therefore puffed up with pride, which they show in their gait and bearing. <span class="cmt_word">Violence covereth them as a garment.</span> Pride and self-conceit naturally lead on to violence, which becomes so habitual to them that it seems like their ordinary apparel (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18, 19</a>). The violence of the great ones in Israel is continually denounced, both by psalmists and prophets (see <a href="../../par/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-9.htm">Psalm 55:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-14.htm">Psalm 72:14</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3-7</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>, etc.).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, these <i>are</i> the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase <i>in</i> riches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and they prosper always. <span class="cmt_word"></span>They increase in riches.</span> This is the impression which the psalmist has received from the general course of human affairs in his day. It is closely allied to the view taken by Job (<a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a></div><div class="verse">Verily I have cleansed my heart <i>in</i> vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</span> Such was the psalmist's first instinctive feeling, when he noticed the prosperity of the wicked. The Prayer book Version inserts, between this verse and the last, the words, "and I said;" which is correct, though somewhat free, exegesis. Compare with the expression, "I have washed my hands in innocency," Job's remarkable words, "If I wash myself with snow, and make my hands never so clean" (<a href="../../par/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/73-14.htm">Psalm 73:14</a></div><div class="verse">For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For all the day long have been plagued.</span> While the ungodly have prospered, and net been plagued at all (ver. 5), I, the representative of the righteous, have been "plagued," or afflicted, continually. What, then, does goodness advantage me? <span class="cmt_word">And chastened every morning;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and my chastisement has beem every morning</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a>).

If, when these feelings assailed me, and the lot of the ungodly man seemed to me much better than my own, I had resolved to speak out all my thoughts, and let them be generally known, then should I have <span class="accented">dealt treacherously with</span> (Revised Version) the generation of thy children. I should have deserted their cause; I should have hurt their feelings; I should have put a stumbling block in their way. Therefore, the psalmist implies, he said nothing - a reticence well worthy of imitation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/73-16.htm">Psalm 73:16</a></div><div class="verse">When I thought to know this, it <i>was</i> too painful for me;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I thought to know this;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and I meditated, that I might understand this.</span> A process of careful thought and consideration is implied, during which the psalmist tried hard to understand the method of God's government, and to explain to himself its seeming anomalies. But he says, It was too painful for me. He did not succeed; he was baffled and perplexed, and the whole effort was a pain and a grief to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a></div><div class="verse">Until I went into the sanctuary of God; <i>then</i> understood I their end.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until I went into the sanctuary of God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the sanctuaries</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/84-1.htm">Psalm 84:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>). The three subdivisions of beth the tabernacle and the first temple, viz. the court, the holy place, and the holy of holies, constituted three sanctuaries. The psalmist, in his perplexity, took his doubts into the sanctuary of God, and there, "in the calmness of the sacred court" (Kay), reconsidered the hard problem. Compare Hezekiah's action with the perplexing letter of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>). Then <span class="cmt_word">understood I their end.</span> There came to him in the sanctuary the thought that, to judge aright of the happiness or misery of any man, it is necessary to await the end (comp. Herod., 1:32; Soph., 'OEd. Tyr.,' ad fin.; Eurip., 'Andromach.,' 50:100; Aristot., ' Eth. Nic.,' 1:10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a></div><div class="verse">Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely thou didst set them up</span>  <span class="cmt_word">in slippery places.</span> The wicked have at no time any sure hold on their prosperity. They are a "set in slippery places" - places from which they may easily slip and fall. <span class="cmt_word">Thou castedst them down to destruction.</span> The fall often comes, even in this life. The flourishing cities of the plain are destroyed by fire from heaven; Pharaoh's land is ruined by the plagues, and his host destroyed in the Red Sea; Sennacherib's army perishes in a night; Jezebel is devoured by dogs; Athaliah is slain with the sword; Antiochus Epiphanes perishes in a distant expedition; Herod Agrippa is eaton of worms; persecutors, like Nero, Galerius, Julian, come to untimely ends. A signal retribution visits the wicked in hundreds and thousands of instances. When it does not, the question remains - Is death the end? This point is not formally brought forward, but it underlies the whole argument; and, unless retribution after death be regarded as certain, a single exception to the general rule of retribution in this life would upset the solution which the psalmist finds satisfactory.
