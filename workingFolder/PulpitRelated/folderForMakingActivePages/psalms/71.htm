He will spend the whole day in telling of God's righteousness and salvation (ver. 15). The mighty acts of the Lord shall form his theme, together with the righteousness of God, and of none other (ver. 16). As God has enabled him to declare his praise in the past (ver. 17), so he trusts to be still upheld and enabled to proclaim the same to the new generation (ver. 18). God's righteousness is "very high," and there is none like him (ver. 19). When he. brings men into trouble, it is only to "turn again and comfort them" (vers. 20, 21). In conclusion, the writer promises that his hymns of praise  shall not only be said, but sung, and accompanied with the melody of music (ver. 22). His lips and soul shall both rejoice together (ver. 23); and the praise of God shall employ his tongue without ceasing (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will hope continually</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but as for me, I</span> <span class="accented">will hope</span>, etc. The phrase, "as for me," almost always marks a transition. <span class="cmt_word">And will yet praise thee more and more;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will add to all thy praise; i.e.</span> "I will add to all my past praises of thee further praises in the future."
