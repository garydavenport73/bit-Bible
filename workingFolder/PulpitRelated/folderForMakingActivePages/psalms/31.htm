If prayer to God for aid in a special time of trouble is the main object of the psalm, the expression of full trust in God is a secondary object, and is maintained throughout (see vers. 3-8, 14, 19-21, 24). Notwithstanding the extremity of his danger, his belief is firm in the coming overthrow of his enemies, and in his own deliverance and restoration. <span class="cmt_word">Let me never be ashamed</span> (comp. ver. 17, where the idea is expanded). David's enemies having come to an open rupture with him, and appealed to arms (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24-26</a>), one party or the other must of necessity be put to shame. Here he prays that it may not be himself; in ver. 17 he goes a step further, and asks that the shame may fall upon his enemies. Deliver me in thy righteousness. Seeing that my cause is the righteous one.

Not doubting of deliverance, he makes his request for <span class="accented">speedy</span> deliverance (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-17.htm">Psalm 40:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/70-1.htm">Psalm 70:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Be thou my strong Rock,</span> <span class="cmt_word">for  an</span> <span class="cmt_word">House of defence to save me;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Be thou to</span> me a <span class="accented">strong Rock</span>, <span class="accented">an House of defence</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).

David prays God to be his Rock and Fortress in the future, because he has always looked to him as his Rock and Fortress in the past. Faith establishes a claim to have its anticipations made good. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore for thy Name's sake lead me, and guide me.</span> Metaphor is dropped, and God is simply asked for guidance and direction. In the struggle between Absalom and David more depended upon wise counsel than upon mere force (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31-37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-5.htm">2 Samuel 17:5-23</a>).

It was, perhaps, by a device of AhithopheI's that David was induced to quit Jerusalem and go into exile. For thou art my Strength (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>; 19:15; 28:1, 7, 8, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a></div><div class="verse">Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into thine hand I commit my spirit</span>. Our Lord's adoption of these words, and application of them to himself and his own departure from earth, have given them a special sacredness beyond that which attaches to Scripture generally. At the same time, they have impressed on them a new meaning, since David was not thinking of a final committal of his soul, as distinct from his body, into the hands of the Creator, but only intended solemnly to commit himself, both soul and body, into the Divine keeping, to be preserved from the attacks of his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth</span>; or, thou <span class="accented">hast delivered me</span>, <span class="accented">O Lord God of truth.</span> It is redemption in the general sense of "deliverance from peril," not redemption from sin, of which the psalmist speaks. David, having frequently experienced such deliverance in the past, is emboldened to expect now another deliverance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-6.htm">Psalm 31:6</a></div><div class="verse">I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have hated them that regard lying vanities</span>. By "lying vanities" are meant idolatrous practices, or possibly such superstitious usages as recourse to witch-craft and divination. (For David's <span class="accented">hatred</span> of such persons as are here glanced at, see <a href="../../par/psalms/26-5.htm">Psalm 26:5</a>.) But I trust in the Lord. Who is the direct opposite of all "lying vanities," being at once Almighty, and the "God of truth" (ver. 5). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a></div><div class="verse">I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy</span>. Anticipating the "mercy" which he has craved (vers. 2-4), the psalmist determines to "be glad and rejoice in it." <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast considered my trouble</span>. When God looks upon trouble and considers it, he is sure to compassionate the sufferer, and to grant him some relief<span class="cmt_word">. Thou hast known my soul in adversities</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>, "The Lord <span class="accented">knoweth</span> the way of the righteous" ). God is said to "know" those on whom he looks with approval. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a></div><div class="verse">And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And hast not shut me up into the hand of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">enemy;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. "</span>hast not delivered me up, without chance of escape, into the hands of my enemies" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-12.htm">1 Samuel 23:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast set my feet in a large room</span>. Given me, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, plenty of space and freedom for action; not confined me, nor cramped me, nor hindered me in any way (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-36.htm">Psalm 18:36</a>). Having cheered himself with the enumeration of these grounds of encouragement (vers. 5-8), the psalmist again returns to prayer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a></div><div class="verse">Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, <i>yea</i>, my soul and my belly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble</span>. The psalmist follows up his prayer for mercy by an exposition of his need of mercy. He is in trouble, in sore trouble - "hard pressed," as Hengstenberg translates - distressed both in mind and body. <span class="cmt_word">Mine eye is consumed with grief</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>, where the expression is almost identical). The grief intended is "that produced by provocation or spiteful treatment" (Kay). It causes him to weep so much that his eye is well-nigh "consumed" or "eaten away." Yea, my soul and my belly. Some explain this as meaning simply "my soul and my body" (Hengstenberg, Alexander, Revised Version); but others regard the "belly" as denoting "the very centre of physical life and of the emotions" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/32-19.htm">Job 32:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a></div><div class="verse">For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing</span>. The psalmist's grief is of old standing. It dates from the time of his great sin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4-17</a>), which is thought to have preceded the revolt of Absalom by the space of twelve years. This sin necessitated a lifelong repentance (<a href="../../par/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>, etc.). My strength faileth because of mine iniquity. Other causes had, no doubt, contributed to produce the profound depression of the psalmist at this period, but none was of equal force with this (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3-10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1-14</a>, etc.). It caused his strength to fail utterly, and led to complete prostration both st mind and body. <span class="cmt_word">And my bones are</span> <span class="cmt_word">consumed;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>racked with pain, as though they were being gnawed away. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a></div><div class="verse">I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was a reproach among all mine enemies</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">am become a reproach</span> (Kay, Revised Version). The psalmist complains of the loss of his reputation. Absalom's rebellion was preceded by a long course of calumnious accusation  of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-4</a>), whereby men's hearts were stolen away from him, and his character blackened. His enemies made the most of these ill reports, and turned them to his reproach (camp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-18.htm">Psalm 69:18-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But especially among my neighbours</span>. Not that they reproached him more than others, but that he felt their reproaches more keenly. <span class="cmt_word">And a fear to mine acquaintance</span>. His acquaintances were afraid of being recognized as such, and involved in his ill repute. They that did sea me without; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "out of doors," or "in the street." <span class="cmt_word">Fled from me</span>. Avoided my contact, not wishing to be seen with me (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a></div><div class="verse">For I have heard the slander of many: fear <i>was</i> on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I have heard the slander of many</span> (see the comment on ver. 11). The calumnies circulated against him had reached David's ears, and these had so affected him that he felt as described in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Fear was on every side, while they took counsel together against me.</span> Fear was "on every side" - in his own heart, and in the hearts of all his friends - when it came to the point of his enemies holding a formal council, in which the matter discussed was the best mode of proceeding against him to take away his life. The particulars of such a council are given in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They devised to take away my life.</span> That David's life was sought is apparent from the last clause of ver. 2, "I will smite the king only." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a></div><div class="verse">But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <i>art</i> my God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I trusted in thee, O Lord</span>. Having fully represented the miserable condition to which he is reduced (vers. 9-13), David now returns to expressions of trust in God, and to earnest prayer to him (comp. ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">I said, Thou art my</span> <span class="cmt_word">God;</span> rather, I <span class="accented">have said.</span> In all my sufferings, dangers, and difficulties, I have always clung to thee, and said, "Thou, and thou alone, art, and ever shalt be, my God."

"My times," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the varied events, happy or sad, which make up the parti-coloured web of life" (Kay). Not one of them but is shaped by thee and ordered by thee. Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me (camp. vers. 1, 2, 4). The great need under existing circumstances was deliverance. Absalom was looked for daily to "pass over Jordan, and all the men of Israel with him" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). A battle was imminent. If the day went against David, and his army was defeated, he would necessarily fall into the hands of his "enemies" and "persecutors," in which case he could not hope that they would spare his life (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-2.htm">2 Samuel 17:2, 12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a></div><div class="verse">Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make thy face to shine upon thy servant</span>. This expression is first used in the blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>). Its intrinsic beauty and poetry recommended it to the psalmists, with whom it recurs frequently (camp. <a href="../../par/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-5.htm">Psalm 80:5, 7, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-135.htm">Psalm 119:135</a>). It may be regarded as equivalent to "Be thou favourable and gracious unto thy servant." Save me for thy mercies' sake; literally, <span class="accented">save me in thy mercy.</span>

"I have," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "been ever thy true worshipper." Even when I have sinned (ver. 10), my sins have not been "sins of unfaithfulness," but lapses, sins of infirmity, unpremeditated yieldings to temptation. <span class="cmt_word">Let the wicked be ashamed</span>. Bring shame, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, upon those who are at once my enemies and thine - the wicked and impenitent generally - and, among them on my present adversaries, those who are collected together to carry on war against me. <span class="cmt_word">And let them be silent in the grave;</span> or, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">Sheol</span>.

The pride and insolence of David's enemies is strongly noted in the Second Book of Samuel (see 16:7, 8; 17:1-3).

David turns from prayer to praise, and in the four next verses (vers. 19-22) eulogizes the goodness and mercy and marvellous loving-kindness of God, who has wrought gloriously for his people in the past, and has further an ample store of mercies laid up for them in the future. <span class="cmt_word">Which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</span> God had wrought his mercies <span class="accented">for</span> his own people, but <span class="accented">in the sight</span> of men generally, whether good or bad.

David's faith was not so firmly fixed but that he was liable, from time to time, to a sudden access of fear (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>).

God did not forsake his servant on account of this temporary failure of faith.
