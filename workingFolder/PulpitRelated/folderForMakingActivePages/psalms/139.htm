God's presence is not to be escaped; his spirit is everywhere. "In him we live, and move, and have our being" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>).

Reflections upon God's wonderful works must overflow into praise; and the phenomena of man's creation and birth are, at least, as calculated to call forth praise and adoration as any other. <span class="cmt_word">For I am fearfully and wonderfully made</span>. The wonderfulness of the human mechanism is so great that, if realized, it produces a sensation of fear.
