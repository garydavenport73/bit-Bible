The present verse and the next are an echo of the Song of Deborah (<a href="../../par/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4, 5</a>), "Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water; the mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel." <span class="cmt_word">When thou didst march through the wilderness.</span> The entire march from Etham to Pisgah is in the poet's mind; but he can  touch only certain features of it. And first, the scene at Sinai. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a></div><div class="verse">The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: <i>even</i> Sinai itself <i>was moved</i> at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth shook, the heavens also dropped, at the presence of God</span> (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22, 23</a>). The "dropping" of the heavens was the descent of a thick thundercloud upon the mount, which rested upon it, and spread around a dense and weird darkness. <span class="cmt_word">Even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">yonder Sinai</span>, as if it were in sight, and could be pointed at. <span class="cmt_word">The God of Israel</span>. <span class="accented">Our God</span>, who did all these great things <span class="accented">for us</span>.

The "establishment" in Palestine under Joshua was a blessing that could not but be highly valued after well nigh a century of cruel bondage in Egypt, and forty years of aimless wandering in the Sinaitic peninsula.

The word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) is an unusual one. <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor;</span> or, <span class="accented">thou, O God, didst in thy goodness make preparation for the poor</span>. "The poor" are the Israelites, brought low by their sufferings in Egypt and the wilderness; the preparations those by which their conquest of Palestine was facilitated (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-28.htm">Exodus 25:28</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>).

The passage is difficult and obscure, perhaps from its embodying fragments of the earlier Hebrew poetry. It is also full of curious transitions, and of ellipses which make the meaning doubtful. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord gave the word.</span> The reader naturally asks - What word? Commentators answer variously: "the watchword" (Cheyne); "promise of victory" (Kay); "the word of command" (Dean Johnson); "announcement of an actual victory gained" (Hengstenberg).

A sudden transition, and perhaps a quotation from an ancient poem. The special object of the psalmist's  thought is not Bashan, but Mount Zion; and what he is about to celebrate is Jehovah's choice of Mount Zion for his dwelling place, and his establishment on it. But he prefers to introduce the subject by a contrast with the <span class="accented">great</span> range of Canaan. Bashan, he says, is truly "a mountain of God" - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a very great mountain (see the comment on Psalm 36:6) - "one which seemed in an especial degree to show forth creative power." It is also an high hill; or rather, <span class="accented">a mountain of peaks</span>, containing numerous pointed summits. Yet God did not choose one of these for his habitation.

The psalmist sees God move from Sinai, where he had represented him as present in ver. 8, into the sanctuary of Mount Zion. He is, of course, accompanied by his angelic host. This is described as a host of chariots (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>) -twenty thousand in number, and "thousands of repetition" - or thousands multiplied by thousands, as Hengstenberg understands the phrase (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">is among them;</span> or, "in their midst." <span class="cmt_word">As in Sinai, in the holy place;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Sinai is in the sanctuary</span>.

Our translators' interpolation of the words, "my people," is unhappy. The psalmist means to represent God as threatening his enemies, not as encouraging his faithful ones. Though his enemies (ver. 21) fly to Bashan and bury themselves in its woods, or though they even hide themselves in the depths of the sea, he will search them out, and "bring them back," that vengeance may be taken on them (see ver. 23).

The conquest of Canaan is complete - God is gone up into his sanctuary. The nations are led captive or put to tribute Rebels are crushed; the last remnants of them sought out, brought back, and delivered into the hands of Israel. Now we have a description of God's "goings in the sanctuary" (ver. 24). Some critics suppose a particular occasion to be pointed at; but the expression "goings" rather indicates something habitual, or, at any rate, recurring. God is from time to time glorified in his sanctuary by ceremonies which the poet describes.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have seen thy goings, O God;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">men</span> have seen - friends and foes alike - even <span class="cmt_word">the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary</span>.

"Little Benjamin" the "smallest of the tribes of Israel" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>) - is called "their ruler," as having furnished the first king, and the one who began the conquests celebrated in vers. 11-23. If the psalm is to be accounted as David's, we may note it as a graceful act on his part that he places Saul's tribe first. The princes of Judah and their council. Again "and" is wrongly supplied. "The princes of Judah" are called "their council," or "their bulwark" (Kay), as holding the most important position in Israel at the time. The reading, however, is doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">The princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.</span> Four tribes only are mentioned, not because no more than four took part in the processions, but as representatives of the whole number. The tribes selected for mention are from the two ends of the land - the extreme south and the extreme north. Zebulun and Naphtali were the most important of the northern tribes (see <a href="../../par/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>), as Judah and Benjamin were of the southern ones.

First, he prays that God will complete the work which he has begun by continually strengthening Israel (ver. 28). Then he rises to prophecy.
