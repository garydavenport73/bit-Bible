Otherwise there is no difference. The God who has given salvation in the past is the Being from whom it is expected in the future.

Identical with ver. 2, except in the omission of the single word "greatly." The psalmist's confidence has increased. He feels now that, whatever his enemies may attempt, he will not be shaken at all.

Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Trust in him at all times, ye people.</span> It is characteristic of David to join the "people" with himself in all his fears and in all his hopes. Even at the worst times, God had always some faithful ones in Israel - a "remnant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>); and men of this sort clung to David through all his perils, and were sufficiently numerous to constitute a "people" (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-1.htm">2 Samuel 18:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Pour out your heart before him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>, etc.): <span class="cmt_word">God is a Refuge for us</span> (comp. ver. 7).

He encourages the faithful, and warns the wicked, by the declaration that men of every sort "are but vanity" - have no strength, no permanence - while power belongs only to God. Those who "oppress" and "rob" are, consequently, not to be feared - there is no strength in riches - God alone determines the issues of things. Unto him belongs mercy, or loving kindness - a quality which leads him not only to forgive men their transgressions, but to "reward" them, when, by his assisting grace, they have done good works. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie;</span> rather, <span class="accented">only vanity</span> - or, <span class="accented">nought but vanity</span> - <span class="accented">are men of low degree</span>; common men, as we call them - mere sons of Adam. This is too evident for dispute; but, in the view of the psalmist, this is not the worst. "Men of high degree" (<span class="accented">beney ish</span>) are no better - they are "a lie" - an unreality - a fading, false illusion. <span class="cmt_word">To be laid in the balance</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the balance, they go up</span> (Hupfeld, Ewald Hitzig, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">They are altogether lighter than vanity;</span> or, <span class="accented">altogether made out of vanity</span> (Kay); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. there is no substance, no solidity, in them.

The class that supported Absalom was the class of oppressors in Israel, whom David kept under and restrained as far as possible. The writer warns them against trusting in their power to oppress, since such strength as they have is not their own, but lent them by God. <span class="cmt_word">And become not vain in robbery;</span> or, <span class="accented">rely not vainly on robbery</span> (Kay). Do not suppose that God will allow you to continue oppressing and robbing. Such a belief is a vain illusion. <span class="cmt_word">If riches increase, set not your heart</span> upon them. Even when wealth accumulates naturally, and not as the result of ill-doing, it is not a thing to be trusted or set store by.
