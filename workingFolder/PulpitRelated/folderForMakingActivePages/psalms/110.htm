To place the foot upon the neck or body of defeated enemies was a common practice of Oriental conquerors.

"The rod of thy strength," or "thy strong scepter," is the same thing as "thy ruling power" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>). The ruling power of Messiah was to go forth from Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4-8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</span> Ac cording to Professor Cheyne, these are the words of Jehovah - a continuation of the address in ver. 1; but they are more gene rally regarded as the words of the writer of the psalm, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, according to our exegesis, of David. He calls on the Messiah to take his power and reign. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thy people <i>shall be</i> willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.</span> In the full sense of the word, Messiah can only <span class="accented">rule</span> over "willing" hearts. In the day of his power, his people will offer themselves gladly to be his soldiers and servants, and flock to his banner, as the Israelites to that of Deborah and Barak, when "the people willingly offered themselves" (<a href="../../par/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2, 9</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18-23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the beauties of holiness</span>. At once warriors and saints, meet for the service of one who was at once Priest (ver. 4) and King. <span class="cmt_word">From the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth</span>. This is the division of the clauses now generally adopted; but the intention of this last clause is very doubtful. Some understand it of Messiah himself, and explain, "As the dew of the morning, abundant, refreshing, spreading far and wide, miraculous, so is the might of thy perpetual youth" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 428); others, and the larger number, interpret it of Messiah's army, "As dew out el the early morning dawn, descending by a silent, mysterious birth from the star-lit heaven, so comes to Messiah his mighty host of followers" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent</span>. "A fresh revelation" (Cheyne). David, admitted into the councils of the Most High, has been made aware that the Messiah is, by God's decree, to be both King and Priest. God has "sworn" this, and will certainly not draw back from his oath. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek</span>. Not, like ordinary priests, a priest for a few years, or for a lifetime, but a priest forever and ever (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span>) - seeing "he ever liveth to make intercession for us" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). And a priest "after the order of Melchizedek." Not, that is, after the order of Aaron, who was a priest and nothing more, but after that of Melchizedek, the elder priesthood, which combined the offices of priest and king (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6-10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-10, 20-28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a></div><div class="verse">The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</span> "Adonai" here is certainly Jehovah (Cheyne). He stands at Messiah's right hand (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>) to protect and defend him, and give him victory in the battle. Ver. 5 carries on the description of Messiah's triumph begun in ver. 3. The kings to be "struck through" are those that resist the progress of the gospel - Herod Agrippa, Galerius, Julian, and the like. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a></div><div class="verse">He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill <i>the places</i> with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall judge among the heathen</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. execute the royal office not only over Israel, but over the nations of the earth generally (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He shall fill the places with the dead bodies</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he shall fill the earth with dead bodies</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with the corpses of those whom he has slain while executing judgment. <span class="cmt_word">He shall wound the heads over many countries</span>. Thus translated, the clause merely repeats ver. 5. Perhaps a better rendering is that of Dr. Kay, "He shall smite him that is head over the wide earth" - either Satan or "the central power of the whole confederacy of evil."
