But the Authorized Version exactly gives the sense (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly</span>. The margin gives, "or wicked," and this is probably the best rendering of the word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The righteous man is first described negatively, under three heads. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> He "does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly:" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he does not throw in his lot with the wicked does not participate in their projects or designs; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he <span class="cmt_word">standeth not in the way of sinners</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he does not take part in their actions, does not follow the same moral paths; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he <span class="cmt_word">sitteth not in the seat of the scornful</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has no fellowship with them in the "scorn" which they cast upon religion. The word used for scornful (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span>) is Solomonian (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>), but in the Psalter occurs only in this place. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">But his delight <i>is</i> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But his delight is in the Law of the Lord</span>. The righteous man is not described positively, under two heads. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> He <span class="accented">delights</span> in the Law (camp. <a href="../../par/psalms/109-16.htm">Psalm 109:16</a>, 47, 77; <a href="../../par/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> He constantly <span class="accented">mediates</span> in it. The "Law" intended - <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>  - is probably not the mere Law of Moses, but God's law, as made known to man in any way. Still, the resemblance  of the passage to <a href="../../par/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> shows the Law of Moses to have been very specially in the writer's thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">In his Law doth he meditate day and night;</span> compare, besides <a href="../../par/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>, the following: <a href="../../par/psalms/63-6.htm">Psalm 63:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-15.htm">Psalm 119:15, 48, 78, 97</a>. Constant meditation in God's Law has characterized all saint. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water</span>. The comparison of a man to a. tree is frequent in the Book of Job (Job 8:16, 17; 14:7-10; 15:32, 33, etc.), and occurs once in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>). We find it again in <a href="../../par/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-14</a>, and frequently in the prophets. The "rivers of water" spoken of (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) are undoubtedly the "streams" (Revised Version) or "canals of irrigation" so common both in Egypt and in Babylonia, by which fruit trees were planted, as especially date-palms, which need the vicinity of water. That such planting of trees by the waterside was known to the Israelites is evident, both from this passage and from several others, as <a href="../../par/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5, 8</a>, etc. It is misplaced ingenuity to attempt to decide what particular tree the writer had in his mind, whether the palm, or the oleander, or any other, since he may not have been thinking of any particular tree. <span class="cmt_word">That bringeth forth his fruit in his season</span>. Therefore not the oleander, which has no fruit, and is never <span class="accented">planted</span> in the East, but grows naturally along the courses of streams. <span class="cmt_word">His leaf also shall not wither</span>. Compare the contrary threat of Isaiah against the wicked of his time, "Ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper</span>; rather, perhaps, in <span class="accented">whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">The ungodly <i>are</i> not so: but <i>are</i> like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ungodly are not so</span>; or, the <span class="accented">wicked</span> (see the comment on ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away</span>. "Chaff" is used throughout Scripture as an emblem of what is weak and worthless (see <a href="../../par/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-3.htm">Hosea 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-17.htm">Luke 3:17</a>). In ancient times it was considered of no value at all, and when corn was winnowed, it was thrown up in the air until the wind had blown all the chaff away (see the representation in the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 163). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the ungodly</span> (or, the <span class="accented">wicked</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall not stand in the judgment</span>. "Therefore," as being chaff, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "destitute of spiritual vitality" (Kay), "the wicked shall not stand," or shall not <span class="accented">rise up</span>, "<span class="accented">in</span> the judgment," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the judgment of the last day. So the Targum, Rashi, Dr. Kay, Canon Cook, and others. It is certainly not conceivable that any human judgment is intended by "the judgment" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span>), and though possibly "all manifestations of God's punitive righteousness are comprehended" (Hengstenberg), yet the main idea must be that the wicked shall not be able to "stand," or" rise up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "hold up their heads" (Aglen), in the last day. <span class="cmt_word">Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous</span>. Here the human judgment comes in. Sinners will be cast out, not only from heaven, but also from the Church, or "congregation of the righteous," if not before, at any rate when the "congregation" is finally made up. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous</span>. God is said to "know" those of whom he approves, and. on whom he "lifts up the light of his countenance." The wicked he does not "know;" he "casts them out of the sight of his eyes" - "casts them behind his back;" refuses to acknowledge them. God "knows the way of the <span class="accented">righteous</span>," and therefore they live and prosper; he does not know the way of the wicked, and therefore the way of the (wicked, or) ungodly shall perish (compare the beginning and end of <a href="../../par/psalms/112.htm">Psalm 112</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/42.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 42"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 42" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
