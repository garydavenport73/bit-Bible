The prayer is for the cessation of God's <span class="accented">wrath</span>, rather than of the "rebuke" which has resulted from it. Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure (see the comment on Psalm 6:1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a></div><div class="verse">For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thine arrows stick fast in me</span>.

Hengstenberg is right, "The arrows of the Almighty denote all the chastisements of sin depending on God." And thy hand presseth me sore. The verb used is the same in both clauses; but it is difficult to express both ideas by one term in English. Dr. Kay makes the attempt by translating, "For thine arrows have sunk deep in me; yea, thine hand sank heavily on me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There is</i> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither <i>is there any</i> rest in my bones because of my sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is no soundness in</span> <span class="cmt_word">my flesh because of thine anger.</span> The psalmist begins with a description of his bodily troubles; and, first of all, declares that there is "no soundness in his flesh," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no healthiness, no feeling of vigour, no vital strength. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there any rest in my bones, he says, because of my sin.</span> His bones ache continually, and give him no rest (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>; and <a href="../../par/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17, 30</a>).

Together with my bodily pain is mingled mental anguish - a sense of regret and remorse on account of my ill-doing, and a conviction that by my sins I have brought upon me my sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me</span>. They press me down, crush me to the earth, are more than I can bear. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a></div><div class="verse">My wounds stink <i>and</i> are corrupt because of my foolishness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My wounds stink and are corrupt</span>. The writer reverts to his bodily pains. He has "wounds," which "stink" and "are corrupt;" or "fester and become noisome," which may be boils, or bed-sores, and which make him a loathsome object to others (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of my foolishness</span>. Because I was so foolish as to forsake the way of righteousness, and allow sin to get the dominion over me. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a></div><div class="verse">I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am troubled</span>; literally, <span class="accented">bent</span>; which some take physically, and explain as "twisted by violent spasms," others, psychically, as "warped in mind," "driven crazy." I am bowed down greatly; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bowed to earth, crooked, as men are in extreme old age, or by such maladies as lumbago and rheumatism. <span class="cmt_word">I go mourning all the day long</span>. My gait is that of a mourner - I stoop and move slowly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a></div><div class="verse">For my loins are filled with a loathsome <i>disease</i>: and <i>there is</i> no soundness in my flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease</span>; <span class="accented">my loins are full of burning</span> (Kay, Revised Version). A burning pain in the lumbar region is apparently intended. And there is no soundness in my flesh. Repeated from ver. 3. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-8.htm">Psalm 38:8</a></div><div class="verse">I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart</span>. In concluding his accounts of his physical condition, the writer passes from details to more vague and general statements. He is "feeble," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> generally weak and wanting in vigour - he is "sore broken," or "sore bruised" (Revised Version), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> full of aches and pains, as though he had been bruised all over - and the "disquietness of his heart" causes him to vent his anguish in "roarings," or groanings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-9.htm">Psalm 38:9</a></div><div class="verse">Lord, all my desire <i>is</i> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - In this second strophe the physical are subordinated to the moral sufferings; the former being touched on in one verse only (ver. 10), the latter occupying the rest of the section. Of these the  most tangible are the pain caused by the desertion of his "lovers," "friends," and "kinsmen" (ver. 11), and the alarm arising from the action taken, simultaneously, by his ill wishers and adversaries (ver. 12). These afflictions have reduced him to a condition of silence - almost of apathy, such as is described in vers. 13, 14. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span> This has been called "the first indication of hope in this psalm;" but there is a gleam of hope in the prayer of ver. 1. Hope, however, does here show itself more plainly than before. The psalmist has laid "all his desire" before God, and feels that God is weighing and considering it. He has also opened to him "all his groanings" - uttered freely all his complaint. This he could have been led to do only from a conviction that God was not irrevocably offended with him, but might, by repentance, confession, and earnest striving after amendment (ver. 20), be reconciled, and induced to become his Defence (ver. 15) and his Salvation (ver. 22). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-10.htm">Psalm 38:10</a></div><div class="verse">My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My heart panteth</span>. This verse, which reverts to the bodily sufferings, seems a little out of place. But Hebrew poetry is not logical, and cares little for exact arrangement. Three more bodily troubles are noticed, of which this is the first - the heart "pants," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> throbs, or palpitates violently. My strength faileth me. The strength suddenly fails. As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. The sight swims, and is swallowed up in darkness (comp. <a href="../../par/job/17-7.htm">Job 17:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a></div><div class="verse">My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore</span>; or, <span class="accented">from my stroke</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/39-10.htm">Psalm 39:10</a>, where the same word is used). The psalmist feels himself to be "stricken, smitten of God" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>). He looks for comfort and sympathy to his friends, but they, with a selfishness that is only too common, hold aloof, draw away item him, and desert him (comp. <a href="../../par/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And my kinsmen stand afar off</span>; or, my <span class="accented">neighbours.</span> The stricken deer is forsaken by the rest of the herd (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56, 58</a>).

To the desertion of friends is added the persecution of enemies, who take advantage of the debility and prostration caused by sickness to plot against the writer's life, to "lay snares for him," and devise evil against him. Those who assign the psalm to David suppose the devices described in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a> to he referred to. <span class="cmt_word">And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long</span>; literally, <span class="accented">speak malignity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> calumniate me - bring false accusations against me (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-7.htm">2 Samuel 16:7, 8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-13.htm">Psalm 38:13</a></div><div class="verse">But I, as a deaf <i>man</i>, heard not; and <i>I was</i> as a dumb man <i>that</i> openeth not his mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I, as a deaf man, heard not</span>. I took no notice, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I made as if I was deaf. <span class="cmt_word">And I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth</span>. So far this psalmist, whether David or another, was a type of Christ (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-14.htm">Matthew 27:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).

So great was my self-restraint. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-15.htm">Psalm 38:15</a></div><div class="verse">For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee, O Lord, do I hope.</span> Thus I acted, because my hope was in thee. I looked for thy interposition. I knew that thou wouldst "maintain my right, and my cause" (<a href="../../par/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a>) in thine own good time and in thine own good way. I said to myself in my heart, <span class="cmt_word">Thou wilt hear</span> - or rather, <span class="accented">thou wilt answer</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord my</span> <span class="cmt_word">God;</span> and I was content to leave my defence to thee. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-16.htm">Psalm 38:16</a></div><div class="verse">For I said, <i>Hear me</i>, lest <i>otherwise</i> they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for I said</span>, <span class="accented">I will be silent</span>, <span class="accented">lest otherwise they should rejoice over me.</span> I feared lest by answering rashly or intemperately I might give my enemies occasion against me. I knew by experience that<span class="cmt_word">, when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</span> They are always on the watch to catch at any slip on my part, and make it a ground for magnifying themselves and denying me. Hence my silence.

I am weak and helpless, liable at any moment to stumble and fall. <span class="cmt_word">And my sorrow is continually before me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my sin, which I sorrow over, which lies at the root of all my distress (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a></div><div class="verse">For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</span> The four "fors," beginning four consecutive verses, are somewhat puzzling. Canon Cook suggests that they introduce four reasons for the psalmist's silence (vers. 13, 14) and abstinence front self-justification: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because God hears him, and will make answer for him (ver. 15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because, if he spoke, he might give further occasion to his enemies (ver. 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because he feels in danger, and is conscious of sin (ver. 17); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> because he has no course open to him but confession and contrition. If we are justified in attributing the psalm to David, and in assigning its composition to the period immediately preceding Absalom's rebellion, we must look upon it as opening to us  a view of David's condition of mind at that time which is of great interest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a></div><div class="verse">But mine enemies <i>are</i> lively, <i>and</i> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong</span>. The psalmist goes back to the thought of his enemies, to whom he has made no answer, and whom he has not ventured to rebuke (vers. 13, 14). He remembers that they are full of life and strength; he calls to mind the fact that they are many in number; he puts on record the cause of their enmity, which is not his sin, but his earnest endeavour to forsake his sin and follow after righteousness (ver. 20); and then, in conclusion, he makes a direct appeal to God for aid against them - first negatively (ver. 21), and then positively in the final outburst, "Make haste to help me, O Lord my Salvation" (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span> This suits well the time of Absalom's conspiracy, when day by day more and more of the people forsook David and joined the party of his son. (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12, 13</a>).

God never really forsakes his saints (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>).
