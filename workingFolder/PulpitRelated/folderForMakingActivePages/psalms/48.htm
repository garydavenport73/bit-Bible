Jehoshaphat had solemnly praised God for the deliverance from the Moabites and Ammonites, both in the valley of Berachah, when he came upon the bodies of the slain (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-26.htm">2 Chronicles 20:26</a>), and in the temple after his return to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-28.htm">2 Chronicles 20:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the city of our God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/101-8.htm">Psalm 101:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the mountain of his holiness.</span> The "holy hill of Zion" (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>), on which the temple and a great part of the city stood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a></div><div class="verse">Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, <i>is</i> mount Zion, <i>on</i> the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beautiful for situation</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for elevation</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of its lofty position. "Jerusalem, above all other great capitals," says Professor Cheyne, "is a mountain city." "It is a glorious burst," says Canon Tristram, "as the traveller rounds the shoulder of Mount Olivet, and the Haram wall starts up before him from the deep gorge of the Kedron, with its domes and crescents sparkling in the sunlight - a royal city" ('Land of Israel,' pp. 111, 112). <span class="cmt_word">The joy of the whole earth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">is</span> <span class="cmt_word">Mount Zion</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>). The psalmist writes as a devout Israelite. To him there is nothing in the world so lovely, nothing so gladdening, as Mount Zion and the holy city seated on it. He does not mean to say that all the earth felt as he did; though he may have thought that, if men were wise, they would so feel. <span class="cmt_word">On the sides of the north</span>. Professor Cheyne regards this clause as a gloss which has crept into the text. Others give a mystical interpretation founded on <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>. But the simplest explanation seems to be the best. Zion, the city of David, lay to the north of the temple, and abutted on the city's northern wall. <span class="cmt_word">The city of the great King</span> (comp. ver. 1, "the city of our God").

Some see in these "kings" Sennacherib's princes, who, according to him (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>), were "altogether kings." But actual monarchs, each leading his own army, seem rather to be intended. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/48-5.htm">Psalm 48:5</a></div><div class="verse">They saw <i>it, and</i> so they marvelled; they were troubled, <i>and</i> hasted away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They saw it,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.</span> The sight of the city, with its walls and towers (vers. 12, 13), was enough for them  - they recognized that the place was too strong to be attacked with any prospect of success; "marvelled," or "were amazed" (Cheyne), at its strength, and, being troubled in mind, hasted away. The unconnected verbs remind the commentators of Caesar's famous despatch, "Vent, vidi, vici."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind</span>. The literal exposition is wholly out of place, since history does not speak of any co-operation of a fleet with a land army in any attack upon Pales. fine. The expression must be used metaphorically of a great and violent destruction wrought by the arm of God upon Israel's foes. Still, the imagery would scarcely have been used, unless there had been something in the circumstances of the time to suggest it, as there certainly was in Jehoshaphat's time, whose fleet of "ships of Tamhish" was "broken" at Ezion-geber (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). The poet may have witnessed the catastrophe.

Having seen with our own eyes Jerusalem thus delivered, we come to the conclusion that God will establish it for ever.

The "Name of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the character that he has established for himself by former mighty deeds, and the praise which he has now won by the recent deliverance, are coextensive. Both of them reach <span class="cmt_word">unto the ends of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> over all the regions known to the writer. <span class="cmt_word">Thy right hand is full</span> <span class="cmt_word">of righteousness.</span> Thou hast dealt out a righteous judgment by thy right hand and thy stretched-out arm, thereby showing how full thy right hand is of justice and judgment.

Walk around it, view it on every side; observe its strength and beauty. Nay, count its towers, and see how many they are, that ye may form a true estimate of its defences, which render it well-nigh impregnable. Such a survey would "tend to the glorifying of the God of Israel, and to the strengthening of their faith" (Hengstenberg). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/48-13.htm">Psalm 48:13</a></div><div class="verse">Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell <i>it</i> to the generation following.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mark ye well her bulwarks</span> (or, <span class="accented">her ramparts</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>consider her palaces</span>. Note the height and fine masonry of her outer wall, which no people could destroy except the Romans (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13-17</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a>).

Dr. Kay translates "even <span class="accented">over</span> death," and understands that God's loving protection is promised to the faithful even in the land beyond the grave. But he stands alone in this interpretation. Host moderns question whether the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> are any part of the psalm, and, comparing them with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> of the title to <a href="../../par/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9</a>, suggest that they are a mere musical notation. But the psalm would end abruptly without the words, and the meaning, "he will be our Guide unto death," is quite satisfactory (so Hengstenberg and the Revised Version). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/47.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 47"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 47" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/49.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 49"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 49" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
