I will praise the LORD with <i>my</i> whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and <i>in</i> the congregation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Praise ye the Lord.</span> Scarcely a part of the psalm - rather a heading or introduction. <span class="cmt_word">I will praise the Lord with my whole heart</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/9-1.htm">Psalm 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-34.htm">Psalm 119:34, 58, 69</a>). "With my whole heart" replaces the "greatly" of <a href="../../par/psalms/109-30.htm">Psalm 109:30</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.</span> Professor Cheyne translates, "in the council and assembly of the upright;" and it seems to be generally allowed that two distinct assemblies are not spoken of, but that the one congregation of the faithful is designated by two names. Thus the Prayer-book translation is wrong. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a></div><div class="verse">The works of the LORD <i>are</i> great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The works of the Lord are great</span>. Not his material works, but the doings of his providence (see vers. 3-9). <span class="cmt_word">Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein</span>. Searched into and carefully studied by all who take an interest in such things. Deru-<span class="accented">shim</span>, "objects of study," is etymologically connected with <span class="accented">madrasa</span>, a college, a "place of study and research." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a></div><div class="verse">His work <i>is</i> honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His work is honorable and glorious</span>; literally, <span class="accented">honor and glory</span>; but our translators have rightly paraphrased. <span class="cmt_word">And his righteousness endureth forever</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his just and righteous dealing with all his creatures. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a></div><div class="verse">He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD <i>is</i> gracious and full of compassion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">memorial hath he made for his wonders</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he has so done them that they cannot cease to be had in remembrance. Memorial institutions, like the Passover, are scarcely glanced at. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is gracious and full of compassion</span>; or, "compassionate" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a></div><div class="verse">He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath given meat unto them that fear him</span>. The manna may be primarily in the writer's mind, but he is also thinking of the "food given to all flesh" (<a href="../../par/psalms/136-25.htm">Psalm 136:25</a>) continually. <span class="cmt_word">He will ever be mindful of his covenant</span>. The covenant with Abraham, made "to a thousand generations" (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-6.htm">Psalm 111:6</a></div><div class="verse">He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath showed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in giving them</span>. God manifested his power to Israel very specially by causing them to overcome the many strong Canaanitish nations, and to take their lands and labors in possession (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-44.htm">Psalm 105:44</a>). This was one of the greatest of his "works," or "doings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-7.htm">Psalm 111:7</a></div><div class="verse">The works of his hands <i>are</i> verity and judgment; all his commandments <i>are</i> sure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The works of his hands are verity and judgment.</span> All that God does is right and just - "done in truth and uprightness" (ver. 8). All his commandments are sure; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. firm, unchangeable - being based on truth and right. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-8.htm">Psalm 111:8</a></div><div class="verse">They stand fast for ever and ever, <i>and are</i> done in truth and uprightness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They stand fast forever and ever</span>. This is exegetical of the "sure" in ver. 7. In the sense in which they were given - the spiritual sense underlying them - not one jot or tittle of God's commandments ever passes away (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And are done in truth and uprightness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">being</span> done. It is the intrinsic truth and equity of the commandments that render them ever lasting and unchangeable (see Cudworth on 'Immutable Morality'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a></div><div class="verse">He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend <i>is</i> his name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sent redemption unto his people</span>. The "redemption" from Egypt (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>) is perhaps especially in the writer's mind, but he may be thinking also of other deliverances. <span class="cmt_word">He hath commanded his covenant forever</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Holy and reverend is his Name</span>. Intrinsically "holy," and therefore "reverend," or to be reverenced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a></div><div class="verse">The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do <i>his commandments</i>: his praise endureth for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; Ecclus. 1:16; and also <a href="../../par/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>). The meaning seems to be that "the beginning of wisdom is not found in keen insight, nor wide experience, nor the learn-hag of the schools, but in the temper of reverence and awe. The fear of the finite in the presence of the Infinite, of the sinful in the presence of the Holy, self-abhorring, adoring, as in Job's confession - this for the Israelite was the starting-point of all true wisdom" (Dean Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">A good under standing have all they that do his commandments</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that do them</span>; but the "commandments" of ver. 7 are, no doubt, intended. <span class="cmt_word">His praise endureth forever</span>. The praise "of <span class="accented">him</span>," not "of <span class="accented">it</span>," <span class="accented">as</span> in the Prayer-book Version. As he had begun (ver. 1), so the psalmist ends, with Jehovah's praise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/110.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 110"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 110" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/112.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 112"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 112" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
