Most commentators suggest the holy angels (Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary,' ' Four Friends,' Professor Alexander, Cheyne, etc.); but some think the heathen (Michaelis, Kay); and others, the mighty ones of the earth generally (Koster), to be meant. <span class="cmt_word">Give</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord glory and strength;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>praise his Name, <span class="accented">ascribe</span> to him glory and strength and every other excellency.

This is generally explained as an exhortation to worship God in beautiful vestments, or with all the accessories of a beautiful ceremonial; but Dr. Alexander rightly questions whether the Beauty inherent in holiness itself is not meant. The apostle speaks of "the <span class="accented">ornament</span> of a meek and quiet spirit" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). And in goodness and holiness of every kind there is a sweetness and grace which may well be called "beauty," seeing that it has a close analogy with the beautiful in external nature and in art. The Greeks expressed physical beauty and moral perfection by one and the same term - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>.

The description of God's might in the thunderstorm now begins with one of the sudden transitions which David loves. "The voice of the Lord" - already identified with the thunder in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a> - is suddenly heard muttering in the height of heaven, "upon the waters;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the waters stored in the clouds that float on high in the air. <span class="cmt_word">The God of glory</span> - the God set forth in vers. 1, 2 - <span class="cmt_word">thundereth</span>. It is he himself, according to the psalmist, no minor agent. The Lord (Jehovah) is upon the many (or, <span class="accented">great</span>) waters (comp. <a href="../../par/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2-5</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7-14</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a></div><div class="verse">The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars</span>. At length down swoops the hurricane - wind and rain and forked flashes of lightning all blended together, and violently tearing through the forest. The tall cedars - the pride and glory of Syria and Palestine - are snapped like reeds, and fall in a tangled mass. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span>, who erstwhile "planted them" (Psalm cir. 16), <span class="cmt_word">now breaketh the cedars of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lebanon -</span> breaketh and destroyeth them in his fury. Such storms, though rare in Palestine and Syria, are sometimes witnessed; and descriptions have been given by travellers which bear out this one of David (comp. Wilson, 'Travels,' p. 146; Cunningham Geikie, vol. 2. pp. 57, 335; Tristram, 'Land. of Israel,' pp. 40, 194, 227, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a></div><div class="verse">He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He maketh them also to skip like</span> <span class="cmt_word">a calf</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>). As the thunder crashes and rolls and reverberates among the mountains, it seems as though the mountains themselves shook, and were moved from their places. This is expressed with extreme vividness, though no doubt with truly Oriental hyperbole, in the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">like a young wild ox.</span> Lebanon and Sirion, or Hermon (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>), are the two principal mountains of Palestine, Hermon being visible throughout almost the whole extent of the Holy Land, and Lebanon enjoying a commanding position beyond Galilee to the north. The storm which shook these lofty mountain-tracts would indeed be a manifestation of power,

To him it seems as if the thunder, rolling along the sky, hewed out  a chasm in the clouds, from which the forked lightning issued. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/29-8.htm">Psalm 29:8</a></div><div class="verse">The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Kadesh.</span> Kadesh seems to be mentioned as lying at the opposite extremity of Palestine from Lebanon and Hermon, so that the storm is made, by a magnificent hyperbole, to extend over the entire Holy Land, from the far north to the extreme south, and to embrace at once the lofty mountain-chains which are rather Syrian than Palestinian, the hills and valleys of Palestine proper, and the arid region of the south where Judaea merges into Arabia. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/29-9.htm">Psalm 29:9</a></div><div class="verse">The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of <i>his</i> glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve.</span> Plutarch says, "Shepherds accustom their flocks in a thunderstorm to keep together, and put their heads in the same direction; for such as are left alone and separated from the rest through terror cast their young" ('Sympos.,' Quest. 2.). And Pliny, "Solitary sheep cast their lambs in thunderstorms; the remedy is to keep the flock together, since it helps them to have company." A traveller in South Africa observes, "In Bechuanaland, when there are heavy thunderstorms, the antelopes flee in consternation; and the poor Bechuanas start off on the morning following such a storm in quest of the young which have been cast through horror" (see Moffat's 'South Africa,' quoted by Dr. Kay, in his 'Commentary on the Psalms,' p. 93). <span class="cmt_word">And discovereth the forests</span>; or, <span class="accented">strippeth the forests.</span> Denudes them of their leaves and branches. <span class="cmt_word">And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his grand temple, or palace (<span class="accented">heykal</span>), of heaven and earth. In this temple "every one," or rather <span class="accented">everything</span>, all that is in it. is continually speaking of his glory (literally, "says, Glory!"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord sitteth upon the flood</span>. Most moderns translate, "The <span class="accented">Lord sat</span> (as King) <span class="accented">at the Flood</span>," and understand by "the Flood" the great Noachian Deluge (Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Revised Version). Some, however, regard this as a forced and unnatural interpretation (Bishop Horsley, ' Four Friends,' 'Speaker's Commentary'), and think the flood accompanying the storm just described (vers. S  - 9), or floods and inundations generally, to be meant. It is difficult to decide between the two interpretations. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever</span>. As God has sat as King in the past, whether at the great Deluge or at any other flood or floods, so will he ever "sit as King" in the future.

The Lord, who shows his strength in the thunderstorm, will be able, and assuredly will be willing, to "give strength to his people" - to impart to them some of that power and might which he so abundantly possesses. Then they, partaking in his strength, need not fear the attacks of any adversaries. Struggle and contention will, by his good providence, be one day brought to an end; and ultimately <span class="cmt_word">the Lord will bless his</span> <span class="cmt_word">people with peace -</span> will give them the "rest which remaineth to the people of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-9.htm">Hebrews 3:9</a>), the perfect peace which "passeth all understanding" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/28.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 28"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 28" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/30.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 30"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 30" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
