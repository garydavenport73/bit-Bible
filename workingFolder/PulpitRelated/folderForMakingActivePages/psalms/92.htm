By "a good thing" is meant that which is at ones right and pleasant. <span class="cmt_word">And to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most High.</span> Israel's Lord, Jehovah, is also "the Most High over all the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/83-18.htm">Psalm 83:18</a>), and should at all times be thought of as both. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/92-2.htm">Psalm 92:2</a></div><div class="verse">To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night.</span> The suitableness of worship every morning and evening has been almost universally felt. The Mosaic Law provided for it by the establishment of the morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38, 39</a>), with the accompanying ritual. Jewish piety added a noonday prayer (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), and Christian zeal established the "seven hours of prayer." Morning and evening still, however, remain, by common acknowledgment, the most appropriate times for worship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a></div><div class="verse">Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery.</span> Some think that only one instrument is intended here, and translate, "Upon an instrument of ten strings, <span class="accented">even</span> upon the psaltery" (or, "the lute"). (On the character of the psaltery, see the comment on Psalm 33:2.) <span class="cmt_word">Upon the harp with a solemn sound.</span> The reference is clearly to the public service of the temple, since in the private devotions of the faithful instruments were not likely to be used. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/92-4.htm">Psalm 92:4</a></div><div class="verse">For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work.</span> It is difficult to say what "work" is intended. Some have supposed "the work of creation," as the psalm is one "for the sabbath" (see title); but perhaps the general "working" of God's providence in the world is more probable. (So Hengstenberg, Kay, and Cheyne.) <span class="cmt_word">I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</span> A repetition for the sake of emphasis. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, how great are thy works! <i>and</i> thy thoughts are very deep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, how great are thy works!</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>). Mighty and wonderful, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, are the ways of Providence. <span class="cmt_word">And thy thoughts are very deep</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a></div><div class="verse">When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; <i>it is</i> that they shall be destroyed for ever:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the wicked spring as the grass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "spring up" - "flourish" (see ver. 12). The difficulty is that which disturbed Job (Job 21:7-21) and Asaph (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2-15</a>), viz. the prosperity of the wicked. The present writer, however, is not disturbed - he sees in their prosperous condition nothing but a prelude to their overthrow. <span class="cmt_word">And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;</span> or, "do blossom." <span class="cmt_word">It is that they shall be destroyed forever;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is for their destruction forever</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-20</a>).

Whatever else is uncertain, this at least is sure, that ultimately God's enemies will perish. The repetition adds the greatest force to the passage. <span class="cmt_word">All the workers of iniquity</span> (comp. ver. 7) <span class="cmt_word">shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be scattered.</span> <span class="accented">All</span> of them - <span class="accented">every one</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>, "Depart from me, ye that work iniquity").

The psalmist speaks in the name of Israel, or of God's faithful ones generally, and confidently predicts their exaltation to glory and honour simultaneously with the destruction of God's enemies. <span class="cmt_word">I shall be anointed with fresh oil</span>. Oil was supposed to give vigour to the frame; and "fresh oil," or "green oil," would be the most efficient and the best. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/92-11.htm">Psalm 92:11</a></div><div class="verse">Mine eye also shall see <i>my desire</i> on mine enemies, <i>and</i> mine ears shall hear <i>my desire</i> of the wicked that rise up against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine</span> enemies (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>). The "desire" is probably that expressed in <a href="../../par/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.</span> This is an unusual phrase, but sufficiently intelligible.

"Of all vegetable forms," says Humboldt, "the palm is that to which the prize of beauty has been assigned by the concurrent voice of nations in all ages" ('Aspects of Nature,' vol. 2. p. 20, Engl. trans.). Its stately growth, and graceful form, its perpetual verdure, its lovely and luxuriant fruit, together with its manifold uses (Strabo, 16:1, &sect; 14), give it precedence over all other vegetable growths in the eyes that are accustomed to rest upon it. It is rather remarkable that, in the Old Testament, it is used as a figure for beauty only here and in <a href="../../par/songs/7-7.htm">Song of Solomon 7:7</a>. Man, in his most flourishing growth, is ordinarily compared either to the cedar (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/5-15.htm">Song of Solomon 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>, etc.)or the olive tree (<a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon</span> (see, besides the passages already quoted, <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/11-1.htm">Zechariah 11:1</a>).
