Moses, though not called a priest in the Pentateuch, performed many priestly acts, such as sprinkling the blood of the covenant at Mount Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6-8</a>), setting in order the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-18.htm">Exodus 40:18-33</a>), consecrating Aaron and his sons (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6-30</a>), interceding for the people (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30-32</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-19</a>),  etc. He is therefore, not improperly, here included among God's priests. <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel among them that call upon his Name.</span> Samuel was not a priest, but a simple Levite (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-16.htm">1 Chronicles 6:16-28</a>). He was, however, a powerful intercessor with God, a righteous man whose effectual fervent prayer availed much. He is united with Moses by Jeremiah, as having weight with God through his prayers (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>; see also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-19.htm">1 Samuel 12:19-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They called upon the Lord, and he answered them</span> (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-19.htm">Deuteronomy 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-10.htm">Deuteronomy 10:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>, etc.).

He was "faithful in all his house, as a servant" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>). Aaron was "the saint of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/psalms/106-16.htm">Psalm 106:16</a>). This general obedience was, however, departed from in some few instances (see the comment on ver. 8).

Aaron angered him still more by sanctioning the idolatry of the golden calf (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1-24</a>). God pardoned both of them these and other sins, but not without inflicting punishment for the sins. <span class="cmt_word">Though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.</span> God's "severity" extended even to these blessed saints, Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. The former two were expressly excluded from the land of promise for their conduct at Meribah (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>); and Samuel's judgeship seems to have been brought to an end through his undue leniency towards his sons Joel and Abiah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-1.htm">1 Samuel 8:1-5</a>).
