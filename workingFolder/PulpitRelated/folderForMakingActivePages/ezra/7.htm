The actual interval seems to have been one of between fifty-seven and fifty-eight years, the sixth year of Darius being  <span class="date">B.C. 516</span>, and the seventh of Artaxerxes Longimanus  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Artaxerxes</span> is in the original "<span class="accented">Artakhshatra</span>," which reproduces the Persian <span class="accented">Artakhshatra</span> with the change of only one letter. That Longimanus, the grandson of Darius, is meant seems to follow from the fact that Eliashib, the grandson of Jeshua is high priest under him (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Darius, correspond to Jeshua, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Xerxes correspond to Joiakim <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Artaxerxes correspond to Eliashib <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But for this it would be possible to regard the Artaxerxes of Ezra (ch. 7.) and Nehemiah as Mnemon. <span class="cmt_word">Ezra the son of Seraiah</span>. Probably the great-great-grandson. In the language of the sacred writers, every descendant is a "son," and every ancestor a "father." Christ is "the son of David," and David "the son of Abraham" (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). Joram "begat" Uzziah (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8), his great-great-grandson. Jochebed was "the daughter of Levi (<a href="../../par/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>). Ezra omits the names of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, who were undistinguished, and claims descent from Seraiah, the last high priest who had ministered in Solomon's temple (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Azariah</span>, the father of Seraiah, does not occur in either Kings or Chronicles; but <span class="cmt_word">Hilkiah</span>, Azariah's father, is no doubt the high priest of Josiah's time (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4-14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14-22</a>, etc.).

We may gather from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> that a Meraioth is also omitted between the Zadok and Ahitub of ver. 2. EZRA'S JOURNEY FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM, WITH DATES (Xerxes 7:6-10). In introducing himself, Ezra seems to regard it 25 of primary importance to state two things  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> who he was, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> what place he had in a history of which the main object is to give an account of the return of Israel from captivity. In connection with the former point, he gives, first of all, his genealogy; and, secondly, the account of himself contained in vers. 6 and 10. He describes himself as "a ready scribe" - one who "had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it," and also "to teach in Israel statutes and judgments." In connection with the latter, he is careful to put before us at once the fact that he too, like Zerubbabel, "went up from Babylon" to Jerusalem by the permission of the Persian king, and, like Zerubbabel, was accompanied by priests, Levites, both singers and porters, Nethinim, and a number of the people (ver. 7). He adds an exact statement as to the date of both his departure and arrival, very natural in one who is his own biographer, and very interesting to the general historian. He also, without any parade of religious sentiment, acknowledges the baud of God as directing, helping, and sustaining him in all his proceedings, ascribing to the Divine favour, especially, Artaxerxes allowance of his journey, and his safe accomplishment of it within a moderate space of time (vers. 6, 9).

It is characteristic of Ezra's piety never to forget that the law was not a mere human code given by an earthly lawgiver, not even a national treasure, the accumulation of centuries, but a direct Divine gift "the law of the Lord" (ver. 10), "the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel" (ver. 11), "the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "by reason of God's favour to him."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-7.htm">Ezra 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">And there went up <i>some</i> of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The same six classes are here mentioned as furnishing colonists under Ezra which, according to the earlier narrative (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>), had accompanied Zerubbabel.

As Artaxerxes began to reign in  <span class="date">B.C. 464</span> (Clinton, F. H., vol. 2. p. 380, note b), his seventh year would be  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>.

This was no doubt viewed as an auspicious day for beginning an important undertaking. The time occupied on the way was exactly four months, which is longer than might  have been supposed to be necessary. Herodotus reckoned it a three months journey  from Sardis to Susa (ver. 53), and the  younger Cyrus conducted an army from  Ephesus to Cunaxa, near Babylon, in ninety-  three marching days (Xen, 'Anab' 2 1, &sect; 6) - the distance in either case being considerably more than that from Babylon to Jerusalem, even supposing the route followed to  have been by Balis and Aleppo. But a  caravan, like an army, requires rests; and we  hear of one such rest at Ahava (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15</a>).  Cyrus gave his troops more days of rest than of movement, and took half the year to reach Cunaxa from Ephesus. We need not be surprised, therefore, that Ezra's journey occupied four months. Some delay must almost certainly have been caused by the perils of the route (see <a href="../../par/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">For upon the first <i>day</i> of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first <i>day</i> of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the good hand of his God.</span> For the meaning of this phrase, see comment on ver. 6. The special favour of God here intended would seem to be deliverance from certain enemies who designed to attack the caravan on the way (see the next chapter, vers. 21-23, 31).

Of this character were - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> the permission accorded to all Persian subjects of Israelite descent to accompany Ezra to Jerusalem (ver. 13); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> the commission to Ezra to convey to Jerusalem certain offerings made by the king and his chief courtiers to the God of Israel (vers. 15, 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> the permission given him to convey to Jerusalem the free-will offerings of Jews and others resident in Babylonia (ver. 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> permission to Ezra to draw on the royal treasury to the amount of a hundred talents of silver, a hundred measures of wheat, a hundred "baths" of wine, a hundred "baths" of oil, and salt to any amount (ver. 22); and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> an indefinite commission to "inquire" (ver. 14). Besides these temporary enactments, the decree contained certain provisions of a more permanent nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Ezra was invested with the chief authority over the whole district "beyond the river," and was commissioned to appoint all the subordinate "magistrates and judges" (ver. 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He was authorised to enforce his decisions by the penalties of imprisonment, confiscation of goods, banishment, and even death itself (ver. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An exemption from taxation of every kind was granted to all grades of the sacerdotal order - to the priests, the Levites, the singers, the porters, the Nethinim, and the lowest grade of "ministers" - to all, in fact, who were engaged in the performance of any sacred function connected with the temple (ver. 24). This last provision was absolutely permanent, and probably continued in force down to the close of the empire.

"King of kings, <span class="accented">kkshayathiya khshaya-thiyanam</span>," an equivalent of the modern <span class="accented">shahinshah</span>, was a recognised title of the Persian monarchs, and is found in every Persian inscription of any considerable length (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persis,' vol. 1 pp. 195, 271, 279, 287, 292, etc.). It was a title that had been used occasionally, though not at all frequently, by the Assyrian monarchs ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 8), and naturally expressed the fact that those monarchs for the most part maintained the native princes on the thrones of the countries which they conquered (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>). It was less appropriate to the Persians, whose empire was in the main satrapial, but still had a basis of truth to rest upon, since the Persian monarch had always a certain number of tributary kings under him ( cf. 'Herod.,' 5:104, 118; 8:142; Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:2, &sect;12; 'Hellen.,' 4:1,&sect;&sect; 3,4,etc.). The Parthian kings took the title from the time of Mithridates I.; and from them it passed to the Sassanians, who style themselves <span class="accented">malkan malka</span>, from first to last, upon their coins. <span class="cmt_word">The God</span> <span class="cmt_word">of heaven.</span> On this favourite Persian expression see comment on Ezra 1:2. <span class="cmt_word">Perfect peace.</span> There is nothing in the Chaldee original in any way corresponding to "peace;" and the participle passage being translated as in the margin of the A.

That Israelites of all the tribes actually went up to Jerusalem on the occasion seems indicated by the "twelve bullocks for <span class="accented">all</span> Israel," which those who returned with Ezra offered on their arrival to the "God of Israel" (see <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>).

They are commonly identified with the "seven princes of Persia and Media," mentioned in Esther (<a href="../../par/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>), "which saw the king's face," and "sate first in the kingdom." A conjecture, which, though not unreasonable, cannot be said to be substantiated, connects the "seven counsellors" with the seven great Persian septs, or families, which had privileges beyond the rest, and among them the right of unrestricted access to the royal presence ('Herod.,' 3:84). The commission which Ezra received is described in this verse as one <span class="cmt_word">to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem;</span> but the subject-matter of the inquiry is not mentioned. He can scarcely have been sent to make inquiry whether the law of Moses was observed or no, since that was certainly not a matter with which the Persian government would concern itself. Probably he was to inquire generally into the material prosperity of the province, and to report thereon.

The residue was, however, to be employed in any way that Ezra, acting under Divine guidance, might direct (see below, ver. 18). Apparently, this residue was actually employed on beautifying the temple (see ver. 27).

Rather, it would seem, they were a part of the voluntary "offering" mentioned in ver. 15, in which they are distinctly included (Ezra 8:25-28). We may perhaps conclude that the vessels sent with Zerubbabel had proved insufficient in number for the great festivals.

Peele ('Dict. of the Bible, Articles, MONEY and WEIGHTS AND MEASURES), it would authorise drawing to the amount of &pound;40,000. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">hundred measures of wheat.</span> Literally, "a hundred <span class="accented">cors</span> of wheat," as given in the margin. The <span class="accented">cor</span> is variously estimated, at 44.25 gallons and at 86.67 gallons. It contained ten <span class="accented">baths.</span> Orders on the treasury for so much wheat, wine, oil, and salt sound strangely in modern ears; but were natural enough in the Persian system, where taxation was partly in kind, and every province had to remit to the court the choicest portion of its produce. Wine, corn, oil, and salt were all of them produced abundantly in Palestine, which was "a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of off olive, and of honey" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-32.htm">2 Kings 18:32</a>), and which, in the region about the Dead Sea, abounded with salt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-23.htm">Ezra 7:23</a></div><div class="verse">Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why</span> <span class="cmt_word">should there be wrath against the realm?</span> In the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanns there was "wrath against the realm" of Persia in a very dangerous quarter, viz., Egypt. Egypt had revolted from the Persians in  <span class="date">B.C. 460</span>, and in the following year, with the assistance of the Athenians, had driven the last Persian out of the country. A vain attempt was made by an embassy to Sparta, towards the close of  <span class="date">B.C. 459</span>, to force Athens to recall her troops. In  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>, Artaxerxes' seventh year, it was resolved that a Persian force should attempt the recovery of the revolted country. Artaxerxes gives his <span class="accented">firman</span> to Ezra when this expedition is preparing to start, and partly alludes to the past "wrath," shown in the success of the rebels, partly deprecates any further visitation. Without pretending to penetrate the Divine counsels, it may be noticed that from the year  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span> things went well for the Persians in Egypt. Memphis was recovered in that year or the next; and in  <span class="date">B.C. 455</span> the Athenians were finally defeated, and the province recovered. <span class="cmt_word">The king and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> This mention of the "sons" of Artaxerxes has been regarded as a proof that the Artaxerxes of Esther was Mnemon, and not Longimanus (Patrick). But it is quite a gratuitous supposition that Longimanus, who had attained to manhood before he ascended the throne, had no sons in the seventh year of his reign. Ultimately he left behind him eighteen sons (Ctesias, 'Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 44). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-24.htm">Ezra 7:24</a></div><div class="verse">Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span> <span class="cmt_word">certify you.</span> The use of the plural is curious. Hitherto the king has made every permission and command to rest on his own sole authority (see vers. 12, 13, 21). Now that he reaches the most important point in the whole of his decree - the permanent exemption of a large part of the people from liability to taxation of any kind, his style changes, and he says, "<span class="accented">We</span> certify you." Perhaps he speaks in the name of himself <span class="accented">and his successors</span>; or possibly he means to say that in this matter he has asked and obtained the assent and consent of his council (compare ver. 28). Or ministers. Rather, "and ministers." It is generally allowed that the word here translated "ministers" is not applied to the Nethinim, but to that still lower grade of attendants in the sanctuary called "Solomon's servants" in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-55.htm">Ezra 2:55-58</a>, and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-57.htm">Nehemiah 7:57-60</a>. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be lawful</span> <span class="cmt_word">to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them</span> It may be suspected from this proviso that the Persians exempted from taxation their own (Magian) priests, though of this there is no other evidence. But they would scarcely have placed a foreign priesthood on a higher level of favour than their own. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-25.htm">Ezra 7:25</a></div><div class="verse">And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that <i>is</i> in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that <i>are</i> beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know <i>them</i> not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, Ezra</span>. This conclusion would be by itself sufficient to remove the document out of the ordinary category of "decrees" or "edicts," and to render it, what it is called in ver. 11, <span class="accented">nish-tevan</span>, "a letter." <span class="cmt_word">After the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand.</span> i.e. "that is in thy possession." <span class="cmt_word">Set magistrates and judges.</span> Both the words used are derived from roots signifying "to judge," and it is difficult to draw any distinction between them. The one translated "magistrates" is that which gives its title to the Book of "Judges." <span class="cmt_word">Which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy</span> God. The latter clause is probably intended to be limitative of the former, and to consign to Ezra's government only the Jewish portion of the population, in which, however, are to be reckoned the proselytes (see comment on Ezra 6:21). <span class="cmt_word">And teach ye them that know them not.</span> As the other inhabitants of Syria were not Zoroastrians, but idolaters, Ezra was given free permission to spread his religion among them.

These powers were always intrusted by the Persians to the civil administrators of provinces, who were autocrats within their respective territories, and responsible to the king alone for the exercise of their authority. EZRA'S THANKSGIVING ON RECEIPT OF ARTAXERXES' LETTER (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27, 28</a>). With an abruptness that may appear strange, but which has many parallels in the works of Oriental writers, Ezra passes without a word of explanation from Artaxerxes' letter to his own thanksgiving upon the receipt of it. Compare the interjectional prayers of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put <i>such a thing</i> as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - Having concluded the important document, which he has transcribed, and not translated, and which is consequently in the Chaldee dialect, Ezra now resumes the use of the more sacred Hebrew, and henceforth employs it uninterruptedly to the close of his narrative. The form of his thanksgiving a little resembles that of David in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-10.htm">1 Chronicles 29:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of</span> <span class="cmt_word">our fathers</span> is an unusual phrase, only elsewhere employed by David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-18.htm">1 Chronicles 29:18</a>) and Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>). "<span class="accented">God</span> of our fathers" is more common, being found in Deuteronomy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-7.htm">Deuteronomy 26:7</a>) and Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-30.htm">Acts 5:30</a>), as well as in Chronicles frequently. <span class="cmt_word">Which hath put such a thought as this in the king's heart.</span> Compare Ezra 1:1. and Ezra 6:22. All thoughts favorable to the Jews are regarded by Ezra as impressed upon the hearts of heathen kings by the direct action of God. To beautify. Or "adorn." Ezra gathers from the general tenor of the king's letter that the adornment of the temple is his main object (see comment on ver. 17).
