DETAILS OF EZRA'S JOURNEY FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15-31</a>). We gather from scattered statements in this passage - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Ezra, with his companions, after a journey of nine days' duration, reached Ahava from Babylon on the ninth day of the first month; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he rested three days at Ahava, and proclaimed a fast; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he was there joined by a small number of Levites and a considerable body of Nethinims from the immediate neighbourhood; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That, on the twelfth day of the first month, he resumed his journey, and, though threatened by some opposition upon the way, arrived safely at his destination fourteen weeks after he quitted Ahava, and exactly four months after he had started from Babylon. The only other important fact mentioned is, that at Ahava twelve of the principal priests were selected by Ezra, and the royal offering of silver, gold, and vessels handed over to them for safe custody, after having been carefully weighed. The weights are recorded with Ezra's usual exactness in vers. 26, 27.

The "river that runneth to Ahava" is now generally identified with the Is of Herodotus (1:179), a small stream flowing into the Euphrates from the east, at a point where stood a city of the same name, distant (according to Herodotus) <span class="accented">eight</span> days' journey from Babylon. The city appears to be mentioned under the slightly variant forms of Ava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 17:24; 19:13). It is called Aia, or Aba, by the LXX.; Ihi in the Talmud; Aei by Isidore of Charax. The modern name is Hit. The town has always been one of some importance in connection with the bitumen springs of the neighbourhood. Ezra s reason for selecting the place as a halting-point seems to have been the fact that many Jews were settled in the district (see ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">We abode in tents</span>. A large caravan, like Ezra's, even when it reached a town, would pitch its tents outside, and remain in them rather than scatter itself among the khans and caravanserais. The phrase is therefore to be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">I viewed</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> Rather, "I looked among the people" - I looked to see whether there were any Levites or no.

It is difficult to account for the fact; but there seems certainly to have been a special disinclination to return to Jerusalem on the part of the Levites. Only seventy-four went up with Zerubbabel, when the priests who returned were 4289 (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-40</a>); and now there was not a single one in the whole of Ezra's band. Did the jealous spirit of Korah (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-8.htm">Numbers 16:8-10</a>) still animate the great body of the tribe?

Jezebel proclaimed one in Ahab's name when she wished to impress the Jezreelites with the notion that a great crime had been committed. Jehoshaphat did the same when he was invaded by the Ammonites, Moabites, and Mehunim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>). A fast was proclaimed in the fifth year of Jehoiakim when the kingdom of Judah was menaced by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a>). Ezra therefore assumes that he may command one now, in connection with the perils of the coming journey. <span class="cmt_word">That we might afflict ourselves.</span> The Jews were commanded to "afflict themselves" on the great day of atonement (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>), and understood that the affliction was to be mainly by fasting and abstaining from the bath. <span class="cmt_word">To ask of him a right</span> <span class="cmt_word">way.</span> Or "a direct road," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a prosperous and unimpeded journey to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">For us</span> <span class="cmt_word">and our little ones.</span> The colonists went up attended by their families.

Before he apprehended danger Ezra had boasted to Artaxerxes of the power and goodness of God, and had spoken of himself and his brethren as assured of the Divine protection. Now that peril threatened he found himself afraid, and would have been glad of such an escort as Nehemiah obtained at a later date (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-9.htm">Nehemiah 2:9</a>). But after his boasts he was ashamed to confess his fear. Who the <span class="cmt_word">enemy in the way</span> was it is impossible to decide; but we may gather from ver. 31 that it was no imaginary foe. Probably some of the Arab tribes, who owed no allegiance to Persia, had formed a design to intercept the caravan and plunder it.

The true sense is given by the LXX. - "Then I assigned twelve of the chief priests to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "then I appointed twelve chief priests to act with twelve chief Levites, of whom Sherebiah and Hashabiah were two, in the matter of the royal offering." Ezra seems to have considered, that as the gift of Artaxerxes was an offering to the house of God, it ought to be handed over at once to the custody of the ministers of religion, and not remain in secular hands (compare ver. 28).

The hand of God led him safely through all the perils of the way, and brought him and his companions without loss or damage to the "city of their rest." EZRA'S THREE DAYS' REST AT JERUSALEM, AND SUBSEQUENT EXECUTION OF THE MORE PRESSING OF THE COMMISSIONS INTRUSTED TO HIM (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32-36</a>). After the fatigues of a four months' journey, a brief period of complete rest was well-nigh necessary. Like Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Nehemiah 2:11</a>), Ezra was content with a rest of three days. On the fourth he discharged himself of his commission to present to the temple treasury the offerings of the Persian king, his counsellors and lords (ver. 25), together with that spontaneously contributed by the Israelites who had accompanied him (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-16.htm">Ezra 7:16</a>). This he did by appearing in person before the priests and Levites who were in charge of the temple, and making over to them the entire offering of gold, silver, and vessels which had been brought to Jerusalem from Babylon. At the same time the exiles whom he had induced to return, and whom he had conducted in safety through so long a journey, sacrificed on the altar of burnt offerings a number of bullocks, rams, lambs, and he-goats, as a token of their thankfulness to God for delivering them from the perils of the way. After this Ezra proceeded to make known to the satraps and other governors of the provinces lying west of the Euphrates the terms of the permanent commission which he had received from the king. The result was that these officials thenceforth helped the Jews instead of hindering them, and furnished the necessary supplies for the temple service.

Like Meremoth, he was a priest. <span class="cmt_word">Jozabad and Noadiah</span>, chief Levites, occur again in ch. 10:23, and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-9.htm">Nehemiah 10:9</a>; and Nehemiah 12:3.

Not only were the vessels counted and weighed, but an inventory of them was made by the priests in charge of the temple, and the weight of every vessel noted. Such was the care taken to prevent any embezzlement of the temple property by its custodians.

The classes of animals offered are the same on the two occasions, and the number of the he-goats is identical; but in every other case the victims are far less numerous now than on the former occasion. This is fully accounted for by the comparatively small number of those who returned under Ezra.

Parts of Ezra's <span class="accented">firman</span> concerned vitally the other provincial governors, and had of necessity to be communicated to them. Such were the provisoes concerning Ezra's power of drawing upon the provincial treasuries for corn, wine, oil, salt, and money (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-22.htm">Ezra 7:22, 23</a>), and concerning the exemption of all ranks of the Jewish sacred order from taxation of any kind whatsoever (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors</span>. The word translated "lieutenants" is that which corresponds to the Persian term "satrap," and designates the highest class of the Persian provincial governors. That translated "governor" is the term which has been already applied by Ezra to Tatnai (<a href="../../par/ezra/5-3.htm">Ezra 5:3, 4</a>) and Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7</a>).
