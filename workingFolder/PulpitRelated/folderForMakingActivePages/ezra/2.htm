The twelve are reasonably regarded as either the actual heads of the twelve tribes, or at any rate as representing them. Notwithstanding the small number among the returned exiles who belonged to other tribes than those of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, there was a manifest wish on the part of the chiefs to regard the return as in some sort that of all the tribes (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-17.htm">Ezra 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The number of the men</span>. The lists in Nehemiah and the apocryphal Esdras differ in many details, and furnish strong evidence of the corruption to which numbers are liable from the mistakes of copyists, and the facility of error when there is no check from the context. Of the forty-two numbers here given by Ezra (vers. 3-60), as many as eighteen differ from the corresponding numbers in Nehemiah. The difference, however, is mostly small; and even the sum of the differences is trivial (see comment on ver. 64).

It would seem that the descendants of the captives carried off from these places retained a traditional knowledge of the locality to which they belonged.

The doubt whether the families of Habaiah and Coz (or Haccoz) belonged to the priestly class or no might then be resolved. But Zerubbabel's expectation was disappointed.

The three authorities agree, however, in their summation, all alike declaring that the actual number of those who returned with Zerubbabel was 42,360. Esdras adds that children under twelve years of age are not included. If this were so, the entire number must have exceeded 50,000 - an enormous body of persons to transport a distance of above a thousand miles, according to Western experience, but one which will not surprise those acquainted with the East. In the East caravans of from ten to twenty thousand souls often traverse huge distances without serious mishap, and migrations frequently take place on a much grander scale. In the year 1771, 50,000 families of Torgouths, reckoned to number 300,000 souls, arrived on the frontiers of China, after a journey of 10,000 leagues through a most difficult country, and were given lands in the Chinese empire. They were followed in the next year by 180,000 Eleuths and others, who had accomplished a similar distance (see De Hell, 'Travels,' pp. 228, 229). Jenghis Khan is said to have forced 100,000 artisans and craftsmen to emigrate in a body from Khiva into Mongolia (Howarth's 'History of the Mongols,' p. 85). The transplantation of entire nations was an established practice among the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. THE NUMBER OF THE SLAVES, HORSES, MULES, CAMELS, AND ASSES OF THOSE WHO RETURNED (vers, 65-67). It may seem strange that matters of this trivial character should be recorded with such exactness in Holy Writ; but enumerations similar in character are not unfrequent (see <a href="../../par/genesis/23-14.htm">Genesis 23:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>). They may perhaps be viewed as teaching the lesson that with God nothing is too trivial for exact knowledge, even "all the hairs of our head" being "numbered" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>). In the present passage the enumeration is not altogether without a further historical value, since it is indicative of the general poverty and low estate of the returning exiles, who had but one slave and one ass to every six of their number, one horse to every sixty, one camel to every hundred, and one mule to every one hundred and seventy-five.

Nehemiah says two hundred <span class="accented">and forty-five</span>, and so the apocryphal Esdras. Perhaps, in the great default of Levites, the services of these persons may have been used to swell the sacred choruses of the time (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>). Hence, it may be, the mention of this otherwise unimportant fact.

The ass (we see) is still, as in the earlier times, the chief beast of burden employed by the Israelites. Horses are rare, camels and mules still rarer; but most emigrant families had, it would seem, one ass (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-16.htm">1 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-30.htm">1 Chronicles 27:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:68-70 THE OFFERINGS MADE BY THE RETURNED EXILES ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT JERUSALEM (vers. 68-70). It has been customary among the pious of all ages and countries to make thank-offerings to the Almighty on the accomplishment of any important or dangerous work. The long journey of the exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem involved considerable risk (see <a href="../../par/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>), and its successful termination naturally called forth their gratitude. The character of the offerings made is indicative of the fact, otherwise probable, that the exiles had turned all that they possessed into money, and had brought to Jerusalem a considerable amount of coin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/2-68.htm">Ezra 2:68</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>some</i> of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 68.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Some of the chief of the fathers.</span> That is, "Some of the heads of families." Each family went up under a recognized head or chief, the number of such heads being, as it would seem, nearly a hundred (vers. 3-61). <span class="cmt_word">When they came to the house of the Lord.</span> No doubt considerable ruins of Solomon's temple existed when the exiles returned, and were easily to be recognized, both by their situation and by the size of the stones employed (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>). The place occupied by these rums was that whereto the emigrants flocked, and about which they, in the first instance, located themselves. <span class="cmt_word">Offered freely for the house of God, to set it up in its place.</span> The first object of the returned exiles was the rebuilding of the temple, and their offerings were consequently given expressly towards the expenses of this costly work. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a></div><div class="verse">They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 69.</span> - After their ability. As each was able; the richer more, the poorer less. <span class="cmt_word">Threescore and one thousand drams of gold.</span> The word translated "dram" is <span class="accented">darkemon</span>, which appears to be the Hebrew representative of the Persian word which the Greeks rendered by <span class="accented">dareikos</span>, or "daric." This was a gold coin, stamped with the figure of a Persian king, wearing his crown, and armed with a bow and arrow. According to the most exact computation, each such coin contained somewhat more pure gold than an English guinea, and was worth &pound;1 1s. 10.5d. of our money. The 61,000 darics would therefore have been equal to &pound;66,718 15s. <span class="cmt_word">Five</span> <span class="cmt_word">thousand pounds of silver.</span> The word translated "pound" is <span class="accented">maneh</span>, an equivalent of the Greek tuna and the Latin mind. In Greece the silver mind was worth a little more than &pound;4 of our money. The value of the Hebrew silver <span class="accented">munch</span> is uncertain, but probably was not very different from the Greek. Thus the sum contributed in silver may be estimated at above &pound;20,000, and the entire contribution at nearly &pound;90,000. It must be noted, however, that Nehemiah's estimate (Nehemiah 7:71, 72) is less. <span class="cmt_word">One hundred priests' garments.</span> Nehemiah says ninety-seven (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 70, 72), whence we may conclude that Ezra uses a round number.

He does not, however, exclude the other aspect, that it was especially a return of Judah, or "Judah and Benjamin" (see <a href="../../par/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezra/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezra 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezra 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezra/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezra 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezra 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
