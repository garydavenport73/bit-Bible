Having described the origin and progress of evil in the world, the final overthrow of Satan and his adherents, and the judgment when every man is rewarded according to his works, the seer now completes the whole by portraying the eternal bliss of the redeemed in heaven (cf. on Revelation 20:10). The description is based upon <a href="../../par/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>. and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; especially the latter, which follows the account of God and Magog, as does this. <span class="cmt_word">A new heaven and a new earth.</span> The dispute as to whether a new creation is intended, or a revivified earth, seems to be founded on the false assumption that the dwellers in heaven must be localized in space (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>, "I create new heavens and a new earth;" also <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.</span> The Revisers follow B and others in reading <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and render it by the English perfect tense. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, is read <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, while other manuscripts give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>. <span class="accented">The first heaven and earth</span>; that is, those now existing pass away as described in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And there was no more sea;</span> <span class="accented">and the sea no longer exists.</span> The threefold division of heaven, earth, and sea represents the whole of this world (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>). Some interpret the <span class="accented">sea</span> symbolically of the restless, unstable, wicked nations of the earth, which now exist no longer; others understand the absence of <span class="accented">sea</span> to typify the absence of instability and wickedness in the New Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem.</span> "John" must be omitted, according to all the best manuscripts. "The holy city" is the Church of God (see on Revelation 11:2), now glorified and prepared for perfect communion with her Redeemer (cf. the promise in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, which is now fulfilled; cf. also <a href="../../par/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10, 16</a>). Contrast this figure of the <span class="accented">holy city</span> with that of Babylon (see on Revelation 18.). <span class="cmt_word">Coming down from God out of heaven.</span> Connect "out of heaven" with "coming down." The same words occur in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> (which see). <span class="cmt_word">Prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span> Here is the contrast to the "harlot" (see on Revelation 17:1). Though many of those forming the <span class="accented">bride</span> are rewarded according to their works (see <a href="../../par/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>), yet their own works are insufficient to fit them for their future life; they are <span class="accented">prepared</span> by God. This appearance is anticipated in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a> (which see). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God <i>is</i> with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, <i>and be</i> their God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying.</span> <span class="accented">Out of the throne</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, and others; <span class="accented">out of heaven</span> is the reading of B, P, etc. As usual, the <span class="accented">voice</span> is described as a <span class="accented">great</span> voice (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>, etc.). It is not stated from whom the voice proceeds, but comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he shall tabernacle with them.</span> Still the seer is influenced by the language of Ezekiel: "And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>). Thus God makes his abode in his glorified Church - the New Jerusalem, among his spiritual Israel (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>, where this vision has been already anticipated). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God;</span> <span class="accented">and they shall be his peoples, and himself shall be God with them, their God.</span> The balance of authority is in favour of retaining the two last words, though they are omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, and others. Evidently the same words as <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a> (see above), "My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people." Cf. "God with them" with "Emmanuel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Now, the promise is redeemed in all its fulness. The plural "peoples" seems to point to the catholic nature of the New Jerusalem, which embraces many nations (cf. ver. 24; also <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a></div><div class="verse">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain;</span> <span class="accented">and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more</span> (Revised Version). <span class="accented">All tears</span>; just as in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces;" cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-19.htm">Isaiah 65:19</a>). There is "no more death" because sin is no mere (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>, "Sorrow and mourning shall flee away"), For the former things are passed away. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "for," should probably be omitted, as in A and P, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> as first written. <span class="accented">The former</span> state of things is the state now existing, which will then have passed away as described in ver. 1.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me, It is done;</span> <span class="accented">and he said unto me, They are come to pass</span> (Revised Version). It is uncertain what is the nominative intended. It may be the "words" just mentioned; or the incidents described in vers. 1-5; or the Divine promises and judgments in general. The analogy of <a href="../../par/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a> supports the last, but it is not conclusive. <span class="cmt_word">I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End;</span> <span class="accented">the Alpha and the Omega.</span> As the book opens, so it closes, with the solemn assurance of the certainty and unchangeableness of God's eternal promises (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>). The second clause interprets the first; a third form of expressing the same idea occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the First and the Last." I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. The same ideas are repeated in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13-17</a>. Again the symbolism of the prophet (cf. ver. 3). There is also another reminiscence of <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> (cf. also ver. 4 of this chapter). In exactly the same sense the words, "living water," are used in <a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "thirst after righteousness"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a></div><div class="verse">He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that overcometh shall inherit all things.</span> The correct reading makes the sense plain: <span class="accented">He that overcometh shall inherit these things, i.e.</span> the promises just enumerated. These words show the reason for the words of ver. 6; and may be called the text on which the Apocalypse is based (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>.); for, though the words themselves do not often recur, yet the spirit of them is constantly appearing (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>; see also <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I will be his God, and he shall be my son</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>, "And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people"). Some have thought that these words prove the Speaker to be God the Father; but it is impossible to separate the Persons of the Blessed Trinity in these chapters. This promise, first made to David concerning Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>), received its mystical fulfilment in Christ (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>), and is now fulfilled in the members of Christ (Alford). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a></div><div class="verse">But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death;</span> <span class="accented">but for the fearful</span>, etc. The construction is changed in the middle of the verse. The <span class="accented">fearful</span> are those who, through cowardice, have not overcome (cf. ver. 7). <span class="accented">Abominable</span>; those defiled with abominations (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>). <span class="accented">And murderers, and fornicators</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 2</a>). <span class="accented">And sorcerers</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>); those who deceived the heathen. <span class="accented">And idolaters</span>; the heathen who were deceived by them. <span class="accented">All liars</span>; all who are false in any way. <span class="accented">Their part</span> is <span class="accented">in the lake</span>, etc. (see on Revelation 20:10). These took no part in the first, spiritual, resurrection (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>); they now, therefore, inherit "the second death." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues.</span> Omit "unto me." "Full of" must be connected with "angels." Just as these angels had carried out God's judgments upon the ungodly, and one of them had exhibited the judgment of the harlot (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>), so now one of them shows the picture of the bliss of the faithful - the bride of the Lamb. <span class="cmt_word">And talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife;</span> <span class="accented">hither</span> (omitting "come"). The wording of this verse (except the last phrase) is almost identical with <a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>. The last phrase is the great contrast to the former chapter. In <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. I was seen a picture of a harlot, the unfaithful part of Christ's Church; here we have a description of those who have been "faithful unto death" (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>), and whose purity and faithfulness are symbolized under the figure of the "wife of the Lamb" (see on Revelation 17:1).

Just as the harlot, signifying faithless Christians, was identified with Babylon, the world city (see on Revelation 18.), so the bride, the faithful portion of Christ's flock, is merged in Jerusalem, the heavenly city. <span class="accented">Coming down</span>, etc. (cf. ver. 2).

The imagery is, of course, symbolical, and there can, therefore, be no question as to individual names of apostles, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> whether St. Matthias or St. Paul is the twelfth. Some writers have, without sufficient reason, brought forward this verse as indicating that the writer of the Apocalypse was not an apostle.

Here the measuring is evidently to indicate the large extent of the city (see on Revelation 11:1).

"Babylon"). The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. The plain meaning seems to be that the city forms a vast cube, and this is typical of its perfect nature. The account given is that of a vision, and not of a reality, and therefore there is no need to attempt to reduce the enormous dimensions given here, as is done by some writers. The holy of holies was thus cubical in shape (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>).

The parallel between the shape of the city as just related and the holy of holies (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) almost seems to have insensibly suggested the transition from <span class="accented">stadia</span> to <span class="accented">cubits.</span> The discrepancy between the height of the city, which is twelve thousand furlongs (ver. 16), and the height of the <span class="accented">wall</span>, which is a hundred and forty-four cubits, has led to the suggestion that in the height of the city is included the hill on which it stands (Alford). Others understand that the wall is purposely described as of small height, because the writer wishes to indicate that "the most inconsiderable wall is sufficient to exclude all that is impure" (Dusterdieck). <span class="cmt_word">According to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel;</span> <span class="accented">of an angel.</span> That is, the measure here used by the angel is that used by men (cf.

There is, therefore, no <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, or "temple," within the city, for the whole city itself is the temple.

The description, following that of Isaiah, makes use of earthly symbolism; but it is not, therefore, to be supposed (as Afford) that there will be hereafter a real earth with inhabitants. "The nations" are the redeemed, described in this way on account of their selection from every "kindred, and nation, and tribe, and tongue" (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>): not the wicked nations of <a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. Though the Authorized Version is probably incorrect in inserting "of them which are saved," yet these words appear to give the correct sense of the passage. The description is evidently still founded on the prophetical writings, "And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</span> Omit "and honour," according to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, and others. Not that there are literal kings and earth. The language is intended to convey an idea of God's supreme glory and unquestioned authority. There are now no kings to dispute his sway. Instead, all join in promoting his glory.

The meaning is: The gates shall never be shut, either by day or night; but it is superfluous to say, "by night," for there is no night there. Some commentators think the open gates are a sign of perfect security; others, that they are open to admit the nations, as described in the following verse. Both ideas may well be understood.
