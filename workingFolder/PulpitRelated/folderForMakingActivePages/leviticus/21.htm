The priest may not take part in any funeral rites, the effect of which was legal defilement, except in the case of the death of his father, mother, son, daughter, brother, and unmarried sister. These are all that appear to be mentioned. But what, then, are we to understand regarding his wife? Was the priest allowed to lake part in mourning ceremonies for her or not? It is thought by some that her case is met by verse 4, <span class="cmt_word">But he shall not defile himself,</span> being <span class="cmt_word">a chief man among his people, to profane himself.</span> The literal translation of this verse is. <span class="accented">He shall not be defiled, a lord</span> (<span class="accented">haul</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> The word <span class="accented">baal</span>, or <span class="accented">lord</span>, is commonly used in the sense of <span class="accented">husband.</span> The clause, therefore, may be understood to forbid the priest to mourn for his wife, being rendered, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as an husband</span> (i.e., <span class="accented">for his wife</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> This, however, is something of a forced rendering. The words arc better understood to mean, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as a master of a house among his people</span>; that is, he may not lake part in the funeral rites of slaves or other members of the household, which ordinarily brought defilement on the master of a house. Then is the priest forbidden to mourn for his wife? This we can hardly believe, when he might mourn for father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. Nor is it necessary to take this view. For the case of the wife is covered by the words. <span class="cmt_word">For his kin, that is near unto him....  he may be defiled.</span> The wife, being so closely attached to the husband, is not specifically named, because that was not necessary, but is included under the expression, <span class="accented">his kin, that is near unto him</span>, just as daughter, grandmother, niece, and wife's sister, are covered by the phrase, "near of kin," without being specifically named in chapter Leviticus 18 (see note on chapter Leviticus 16:18). Even when mourning is permitted, the priest is to use no excessive forms of it, still less any that have been used by idolaters. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard</span> (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">nor make any cuttings in their flesh</span> (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). And the reason why they are to avoid ceremonial uncleanness in some cases, and to act with sobriety and gravity in all, is that they are dedicated to God, <span class="cmt_word">to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the bread of their God;</span> that is, the sacrifices which are consumed by the fire of the altar symbolizing the action of God (see note on Leviticus 3:11).

In a similar spirit, St. Paul gives directions as to the families of those to whom the ministry of the Spirit is assigned (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-11.htm">1 Timothy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>). Keil would unite verse 4 in sense with verses 7-9, and argues that <span class="accented">he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself</span>, refers to the kind of marriage which the priest is to make, but the interposition of verses 5 and 6 forbid this explanation of verse 4.

He may not, therefore. incur legal uncleanness by taking part in the funeral rites, even of his father or mother, not being permitted to absent himself from the sanctuary, which he would have to do if he had thus ceremonially defiled himself. Nor is it enough that he should abstain from taking an immoral or a divorced wife; he may only wed <span class="cmt_word">a virgin and of his own people,</span> whereas the other priests might marry widows and the daughters of strangers dwelling among the Israelites. In the ordinances for priests given in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44.htm">Ezekiel 44</a>, the ordinary priests, as well as the high priest, are forbidden to marry widows, unless they be the widows of priests (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a>).

The translation <span class="cmt_word">dwarf</span>, in verse 20, is better than the marginal rendering "too slender," or withered. Being the descendants of Aaron, these priests, blemished as they were, were to be supported as the other priests were supported. <span class="cmt_word">He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy;</span> that is, the priests' portions of the meat offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17</a>), of the sin offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-29.htm">Leviticus 6:29</a>), of the trespass offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1</a>), of the shewbread (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), which were most holy, and of the heave offerings, wave offerings, firstfruit offerings, firstlings, and things devoted (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-11.htm">Numbers 11:11-19</a>), which were holy. They were also apparently employed in the less formal and conspicuous duties of the priests, such as examining lepers, and any other functions which did not bring them <span class="cmt_word">nigh unto the altar</span>. But they were not to <span class="cmt_word">profane God's sanctuaries</span>, by which is meant the holy of holies, the holy place, and the court in which the altar stood. To none of these is the blemished priest to be admitted for the purpose of officiating, though he might enter the court and probably the holy place for other purposes, and might eat the offerings of the priests in the accustomed place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
