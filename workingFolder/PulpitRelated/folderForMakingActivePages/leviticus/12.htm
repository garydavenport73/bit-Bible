In accordance with these instincts, purifying rites are commanded for the restoration of those affected to ceremonial cleanness. These instincts and consequent regulations respecting women in childbirth are found in very many different nations. "The Hindoo law pronounced the mother of a newborn child to be impure for forty days, required the father to bathe as soon as the birth had taken place, and debarred the whole family for a period from religious rites, while they were 'to confine themselves to an inward remembrance of the Deity;' in a Brahmin family this rule extended to all relations within the fourth degree, for ten days, at the end of which they had to bathe. According to the Parsee law, the mother and child were bathed, and the mother had to live in seclusion for forty days, after which she had to undergo other purifying rites. The Arabs are said by Burekhardt to regard the mother as unclean for forty days. The ancient Greeks suffered neither childbirth nor death to take place within consecrated places; both mother and child were bathed, and the mother was not allowed to approach an altar for forty days. The term of forty days, it is evident, was generally regarded as a critical one for both the mother and the child. The day on which the Romans gave the name to the child - the eighth day for a girl, and the ninth for a boy - was called <span class="accented">lustrieus dies</span>, 'the day of purification,' because certain lustral rites in behalf of the child were performed on the occasion, and some sort of offering was made. The <span class="accented">amphidromia</span> of the Greeks was a similar lustration for the child, when the name was given, probably between the seventh and tenth days" (Clark). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She shall be unclean seven days.</span> The mother is to be <span class="accented">unclean seven days</span>, and after that to be <span class="cmt_word">in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days</span> (verse 4). The difference between these two states maybe seen by looking on to <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-28</a>, and comparing that passage with verse 4 of this chapter. In the first stage, during the seven days, she made all that she touched unclean; in the second stage, during the thirty-three days, she was only required to <span class="cmt_word">touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary</span>, as she was progressing towards cleanness. The number of days during which she is to be altogether unclean is to be <span class="cmt_word">according to the days of the separation for her infirmity</span>, that is, seven days, as in the case of her monthly courses (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</span> The Levitical legislation recognizes the regulation as to the day of the circumcision made at the time of the covenant with Abraham.

See <a href="../../par/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a>, where the right reading is, "When the days of <span class="accented">their</span> purification, according to the Law of Moses, were accomplished." For eight days the infant Saviour submitted to legal uncleanness in "fulfilling all righteousness" (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>), and therefore the whole forty days were spoken of as "the days of their purification." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/12-6.htm">Leviticus 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - The previous verses having stated the conditions and the term of continuance of the uncleanness arising from childbirth, the three final verses describe the offerings to be made by the woman for her purification. <span class="cmt_word">She shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering.</span> Two things are noticeable here: first, that the burnt offering, symbolizing self-devotion, is far more costly and important than the sin offering, which had not to be offered for any individual personal sin, but only for human sin, "which had been indirectly manifested in her bodily condition" (Keil); and secondly, that in this one case the sin offering appears to succeed the burnt offering instead of preceding it. No doubt the changed order is owing to the cause just mentioned; the idea of sin, though it may not be altogether put aside (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>), is not to be prominent, as though it were peculiar to the special woman who was purified.
