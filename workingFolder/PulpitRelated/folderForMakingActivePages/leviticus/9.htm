He is still instructed by Moses as to what he is to do, but it is through him that the command is given to the people to present their offerings, and it is he that slays the victims and offers their blood. His own sin offering is a <span class="cmt_word">young calf</span>, or young bull calf, whereas the sin offering commanded for the high priest on ordinary occasions was a young bull, further advanced in age (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>); and in presenting the blood he does not take it into the sanctuary according to the regulations in chapter Leviticus 4:6, but uses it as Moses had done in the sin offerings of the previous week, the purpose of the difference being to show that Aaron's full dignity had not yet devolved upon him. This did not take place until he had gone into the tabernacle with Moses (verse 23). <span class="cmt_word">A ram</span> is again taken for the burnt offering, as had been the case in Moses' sacrifice of the previous week. The children of Israel now present a kid, the offering generally made by a prince, that for the congregation being a young bull. In the words <span class="cmt_word">for today the Lord will appear unto you</span>, Moses promises the Divine appearance afterwards vouchsafed (verse 23).

It is probable that, on this occasion, the people's burnt offering, which consisted of a calf and a lamb, took the place of the ordinary morning sacrifice of a lamb (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>). Aaron is said to have <span class="cmt_word">offered the burnt offering according to the manner</span>, or, as it is given in the margin, <span class="accented">ordinance</span>, that is, he burnt the flesh on the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7-9</a>); he also <span class="cmt_word">burnt</span> the <span class="cmt_word">handful</span> of the meat offering, and he <span class="cmt_word">burnt the fat</span> of the peace offering, <span class="cmt_word">upon the altar</span>.

During this visit Moses committed to Aaron the care of the things within the tabernacle, as he had already given him the charge of all connected with the sacrifices of the court. Not till after this is Aaron fully initiated into his office. "No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>). On coming out from the tabernacle, Moses and Aaron, standing near the door, unite in blessing the congregation, in order to show the harmony between them and the capacity of blessing in the Name of the Lord enjoyed by Aaron as by Moses. The latter has now divested himself of that part of his office which made him the one mediator between God and his people, Aaron is henceforth a type of Christ as well as Moses. While giving the joint blessing, the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people, proceeding from the ark, and enveloping the lawgiver and the priest as they stood together. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a></div><div class="verse">And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <i>which</i> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a fire out from before the Lord.</span> The sacrifices were already smouldering on the altar, a ram, a calf, and a lamb, besides the internal fat of a young bull, a kid, a bullock, and a ram, and a handful of flour. They would have continued smouldering all the day and the night, but a miraculous fire issued from the tabernacle, and consumed the whole in the sight of the people. So fire fell and consumed Solomon's sacrifice at the dedication of the temple. Jewish tradition reports that the fire was always kept alive until the reign of Manasseh, when it became extinguished. <span class="cmt_word">When the people saw</span> this sight, <span class="cmt_word">they shouted</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">fell on their faces</span>. They had been standing in a state of intense expectation, awaiting the fulfillment of the promise that the Lord would appear unto them today, and watching the acts of the two brothers; and their feelings are now raised to the utmost enthusiasm and awe by the appearance of the glory of the Lord and the notion of the Divine fire.
