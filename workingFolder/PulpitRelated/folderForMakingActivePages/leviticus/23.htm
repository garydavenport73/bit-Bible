THIS Part consists of chapters 23, and 25, with chapter 24 parenthetically introduced. Every religion must have its round of holy days and seasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To give occasion for manifesting joyous thankfulness to the Giver of all good things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To keep alive the memory of past events around which religious associations cling. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To impress upon the hearts of the worshippers those sacred mysteries which are regarded as essential characteristics of the system. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The duty and happiness of rejoicing before the Lord find a prominent place under the Mosaic dispensation, as they must in any religion where man feels himself in a covenant relation with God, brought nigh to him by himself, and no longer estranged from him who is his only true life and happiness. Accordingly, the first thought of the annual Jewish festivals is that of joyous thankfulness, such as is becoming to reconciled children grateful to their Father for the many bounties that they receive at his hands. The first gift of God of which man becomes conscious is that of the daily sustenance provided for him, and therefore we should expect holy days to be appointed to commemorate the goodness of God in bestowing the gifts of the earth. The first aspect, therefore, in which to regard the three great annual festivals - the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles - is that they were days of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth dispensed by God to man. First, with regard to the Passover. We read at verses 10, 11, <span class="accented">"When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf</span> [or <span class="accented">an omer</span>] <span class="accented">of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it."</span> The words, "the morrow after the sabbath," mean, as we shall see, the day after the first day of Unleavened Bread, that is, the second day of the feast, Nisan 16, which fell early in April, when the first barley was ripening in Palestine. On the 14th day of Nisan (the day of the Paschal sacrifice) a certain quantity of standing barley was marked off, by men specially appointed for the purpose, in a field ploughed the previous autumn and sown at least ten weeks before the Passover, but not prepared artificially in such a way as to hasten the crop. On the following day, Nisan 15, at sunset, three men were sent to the selected field, and, in the presence of witnesses, cut the ears of corn before marked, and brought them into the temple. On the next day, Nisan 16, this corn, whether in the form of a sheaf or of flour, was offered to the Lord by being waved before him, and then consigned to the priest. Here, by the presentation of the firstfruits of the year, an acknowledgment is made that the products of the earth are by right God's. This is one of the objects of the Feast of the Passover. Secondly, as to Pentecost. After the sheaf, or omer, had been offered on Nisan 16, it was allowable to make the new year's barley into bread, but the dedication of the grain crops was not complete until a portion of the wheat crop had also been offered. This was done a week of weeks later, at the Feast of Pentecost, forty-nine days after the presentation of the barley, and fifty days after the first day of Unleavened Bread. On this day, two leavened loaves, of the same size as the shewbread loaves, were waved before the Lord, and then delivered to the priest. These loaves were made out of ears of corn selected and reaped as the barley had been seven weeks before, and then threshed and ground in the temple. They were regarded as the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, though they were not made of the first cut wheat; and from their presentation the festival has the name of the Feast of Harvest (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>); the Feast of the Firstfruits of the Wheat Harvest (Exodus 24:22); the Day of the Firstfruits (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>); while, from its date relatively to the Passover, it is called the Feast of Weeks (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>). The name, Feast of Pentecost, is found only in the Apocrypha (Tobit 2:1; 2 Macc. 12:32), and in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-16.htm">Acts 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>). The meat offerings might not be made of the new year's flour until these two loaves had been offered. Thirdly, with regard to the Feast of Tabernacles. The festivals connected with the seasons of the year and the products of the soil were not ended until the Feast of Ingathering (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>), or Tabernacles (verse 34; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>), had been celebrated. This festival occurred about the beginning of October, and commemorated the final gathering in of all the fruits of the year, specially of the olives and the grapes. It was observed by a general dwelling in booths made of the branches of palms, willows, olives, pines, myrtles, and other close-growing trees (verse 40; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>), in which all the Israelite males, with the exception of the sick, lived for seven days, and kept harvest home. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The second aspect in which to regard the annum festivals is the historical one. The <span class="accented">Passover</span> is characterized by its historical associations to a greater degree than either of the other festivals. The whole national life of the Israelites received its character from the Egyptian Exodus, and accordingly the anniversaries of their religious year began with its commemoration. It was the events which had taken place in Egypt which gave to the Paschal sacrifice and the Paschal feast their primary signification; and while to us the Passover festival serves as a proof of the truth of those events, to the Jew it served as a memorial of them, preventing them from ever being forgotten or disregarded (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3-16</a>). The ancient Christian Fathers suggested that the <span class="accented">Feast of Pentecost</span> commemorated the institution of the old dispensation at Sinai, as, to Christians, it recalled the institution of the new Law by the gift of the fiery tongues at Jerusalem. This suggestion was adopted by Maimonides and the later school of Hebrew commentators, and it is a very probable conjecture; but as no appearance of it is found in the Old or New <span class="accented">Testaments</span>, nor even in early Hebrew writers, it cannot be regarded as a certainty. Historically, the <span class="accented">Feast of Tabernacles</span> is generally considered to commemorate the dwelling in tents throughout the forty years' wandering in the wilderness; but if this were so, it would have been called the Feast of Tents, for the words "tent" and "tabernacle" differ, and the Israelites did not dwell in tabernacles in the wilderness. Rather, it commemorates the first encampment of the Israelites after setting forth from Egypt, which took place at "Succoth," the meaning of which word is "tabernacle" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). Thus, as the event historically associated with the first harvest festival, the Passover, was the setting forth from Egypt, that associated with the last, the Feast of Tabernacles, was the resting at the end of the first day's journey at Succoth, where the people now felt that they were free, and began to rejoice in their freedom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The typical character of the feasts, as well as their historical character, is more apparent in the <span class="accented">Passover</span> than in the other two feasts. St. Paul's testimony on this point is sufficient: "For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Here we have the typical character of the Paschal lamb, and of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, authoritatively declared to us. The blood of the lamb slain on the night before the Exodus, being the means whereby the Israelites were delivered from the destruction which fell on all the rest of the inhabitants of the land, typified the still more efficacious bloodshedding by which the redemption of Christ's people was wrought. The <span class="accented">Feast of Pentecost</span>, if it commemorated the gift of the Law at Mount Sinai, pointed thereby to the giving of the better Law on the day when the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles in Jerusalem; and in any case, as a Feast of Firstfruits, it was emblematic of those firstfruits of the Christian Church presented to God on that day (<a href="../../par/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>). The <span class="accented">Feast of Tabernacles</span>, in which God's people commemorated their rejoicing in their newly found liberty after the slavery of Egypt, awaits its full typical fulfillment in the spiritual joy of the redeemed after they have been delivered from the burden of the flesh and the sufferings of the world; but its typical meaning is partially fulfilled in the blessed peace and joy spread abroad in the hearts of the children of God by reason of their adoption in Christ, whereby we have obtained an inheritance with the saints (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11, 18</a>). In the annual fast held on the 10th of Tisri, the great Day of Atonement, the typical element outweighs any other. The present and the past sink away in comparison with the future. The day suggests no thought of the seasons or of the products of the earth, and it recalls no event of past history. It teaches a lesson - the need of reconciliation; and by the entrance of the high priest into the holy of holies with sacrificial blood, and by the ceremony of the scapegoat, it typically foreshadows how that reconciliation is to he effected. The monthly festivals had a purpose different from the annual. They occurred on the new moon, or the first day of each month, and their intention was to dedicate each month to God. Only one of these monthly festivals is mentioned in this chapter the Feast of Trumpets. It is the feast of the new moon of the sacred seventh month, with which the civil year began. Because it was New Year's Day, it had more ceremonies attached to it than the first days of the other months. Whereas the feasts of the new moons in other months only sanctified the special month which they began, the Feast of Trumpets sanctified also the whole year, and was therefore an annual as well as a monthly feast. The weekly festival was the sabbath (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>). This feast sanctified each week, as the monthly feasts sanctified each month; and like the annual festivals, it looked both backwards and forwards: backwards, to the sanctification bestowed upon it "Because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>); forwards, to the great sabbath in which Christ rested in the grave, and yet further onwards to another sabbath still to be enjoyed by the people of God. The sabbatical year and the jubilee were extensions of the sabbatical principle - certain civil and religious institutions and regulations being attached to each of them.

There were in all seven <span class="accented">holy convocations</span> in the year, besides the sabbath, namely, the first and last days of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Pentecost, the Day of Atonement, the Feast of Trumpets, the first and last days of the Feast of Tabernacles.

In the sanctuary itself the peculiar characteristics of the sabbath were a holy convocation, the renewal of the shewbread, and the burnt offering of two lambs with their meat and drink offerings (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9, 10</a>); elsewhere it was observed only by the holy convocation and rest from all labour. It commenced at sunset on Friday evening, and continued till sunset on Saturday evening. In later days the hour at which it began was announced by three blasts of the priests' trumpets, immediately after which a new course of priests entered on their ministry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">These <i>are</i> the feasts of the LORD, <i>even</i> holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - This verse repeats the statement or heading contained in verse 2, with reference to the annual holy day, the sabbath having been disposed of in verse 3. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">In the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the first month at even <i>is</i> the LORD'S passover.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord's passover.</span> The month of Nisan was made the first month of the religious year in consequence of the original Passover having taken place in it (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>). On the occasion of the first, or Egyptian, Passover, all heads of a family, either singly or two or three heads of families in conjunction, provided themselves with a lamb or a kid on the 10th day of Nisan, killed it in the evening of the 14th, and, taking a bunch of hyssop, dipped it in the blood and struck the lintel and two side posts of the doors of their houses with the blood. They then roasted the animal whole for eating, added to it unleavened bread, and garnished it with bitter herbs. They made themselves ready to eat it by dressing themselves for a journey, "with their loins girded, their shoes on their feet, and their staff in their hands" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>), and thus they ate it in haste, in a standing position. The meaning of the ceremony is explained by what was taking place at the same time. On the same night, after the blood had been sprinkled upon the lintel and side posts, God slew the firstborn of all who had not exhibited this symbol of their having been brought into covenant with himself, and the Israelites set off hurriedly on their departure from Egypt. It was commanded that the day should be kept hereafter in like manner as a memorial, and that the following seven days should be kept as a Feast of Unleavened Bread (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14, 15</a>). This command is here concisely repeated, as it is again repeated in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>. One very considerable change was, however, necessarily made in the method of its observance. Originally, each head of a household or combination of households sacrificed the lamb himself, and sprinkled the blood upon the doorposts and lintel. But after the establishment of the Aaronic priesthood and the withdrawal of the priestly authority previously vested in each head of a house (chapters 8, 9), and after the stringent prohibition of sacrificing elsewhere than in the court of the tabernacle had been issued (chapter 17), this could not continue. Accordingly, we find in the Book of Deuteronomy the direct injunction, "Thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee: but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his Name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5, 6</a>). A result from this rule was that every male Israelite had to present himself at Jerusalem, and there slay his lamb on the day of the Passover, which in the time of Nero, brought between two and three million pilgrims to Jerusalem each year. The crowd of pilgrims took their way to the temple, and were admitted into the court in three divisions. There they slew each man his lamb, while the priests offered the blood on the altar, and the Levites sang the Hallel (<a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>). Then they bore away the lambs, roasted them whole on a spit of pomegranate wood, taking care that no bone should be broken, and prepared the Paschal supper. At the supper, as well as at the sacrifice, a change of manner was introduced. "As the guests gathered round the Paschal table, they came no longer, as at the first celebration, with their loins girded, with shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hands; that is, as travelers waiting to take their departure. On the contrary, they were arrayed in their best festive garments, joyous and at rest, as became the children of a king. To express this idea, the rabbis also insisted that the Paschal supper, or at least part of it, must be eaten in that recumbent position with which we are familiar from the New Testament. 'For,' say they, 'they use this leaning posture, as free men do, in memorial of their freedom.' And again, 'Because it is the manner of slaves to eat standing, therefore now they eat sitting and leaning, in order to show that they have been delivered from bondage into freedom.' And finally, 'No, not the poorest in Israel may eat till he has sat down, leaning.' But though it was deemed desirable to sit leaning during the whole Paschal supper, it was only absolutely enjoined while partaking of the bread and the wine" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The essentials of the Paschal feast were the Paschal lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>). To these were afterwards added a dish formed from an animal sacrificed on the Passover day, a composition of dates and other dried fruits, and four cups of red wine mixed with water, the last of which came to be regarded as essential as that which had been commanded in the Law. The Rabbi Gamaliel is reported by the Mishna to have said, "Whoever fails to explain three things in the Passover fails to fulfill his duty. These are the Paschal lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. The Paschal lamb means that God passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt, which were sprinkled with blood; the unleavened bread, that our fathers were hurried out of Egypt; the bitter herbs, that the Egyptians made the lives of our fathers in Egypt bitter" (Pes. 10:15). The wine was regarded so necessary an adjunct, that it is ordered that every householder must provide himself with four cups, even if he had to sell or pawn his coat, or hire himself out for a servant, or receive money from the poor's box, in order to do so (Pes. 1). The supper began with drinking the first cup of wine, before which a grace, or thanksgiving, of the following character was said: - "Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, who hast created the fruit of the vine! Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from among all people, and exalted us from among all languages, and sanctified us with thy commandments! And thou hast given us, in love, the solemn days for joy, and the festivals and appointed seasons for gladness, and this, the day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the season of our freedom, a holy convocation, the memorial of our departure from Egypt. For us hast thou chosen; and us hast thou sanctified from among all nations, and thy holy festivals with joy and with gladness hast thou caused us to inherit. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the appointed seasons! Blessed art thou, Lord, King of the universe, who hast preserved us alive, and sustained us, and brought us to this season" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). After drinking the first cup, there followed a general washing of hands, after which the company ate some of the bitter herbs. Then the second cup was filled, and in order to carry out the injunction of <a href="../../par/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26, 27</a>, the youngest member of the company inquired, "What mean ye by this service?" And the president of the feast replied, "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses." At the same time, he explained the purport of the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs, and called upon the company to give thanks for what God had wrought for them and for their fathers, ending with <a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113, 114</a>, sung by all present. The second cup was then drunk, and after second washing of hands, the unleavened bread was broken, and thanks again given, after which the pieces of bread, the bitter herbs, the other sacrificial dish (if any), and the Paschal lamb were partaken of in turn. The third cup was then filled, thanks were again given, and the cup was drunk. This cup had the name of the "cup of blessing," owing to the blessing said over it, and it was succeeded after an interval by the fourth cup, when <a href="../../par/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115-118</a> (which, with <a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113, 114</a>, made up the Hallel) were sung, followed by a prayer of thanksgiving. <p> CHAPTER 23:6-44 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">And on the fifteenth day of the same month <i>is</i> the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The Feast of Unleavened Bread was instituted at the same time with the Feast of the Passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15-17</a>), and from the beginning the two festivals were practically but one festival, never separated, though separable in idea. The Passover, strictly so called, lasted but one day, Nisan 14; the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted seven days, Nisan 15-21. The whole made a festival of eight days, called indifferently the Feast of the Passover, or the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The bread to be eaten throughout the festival was unleavened, in order to remind the Israelites of the historical fact that on account of the urgency of the Egyptians, "the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>), and quitted the land of their affliction in haste. Accordingly, in the Book of Deuteronomy it is appointed, "Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou earnest forth out of the laud of Egypt all the days of thy life" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>).

It was on the first day, Nisan 15, that our Lord was crucified. The Pharisees found nothing in the holiness of the day to prevent their taking virtual part in his seizure and condemnation and death; but we are told by St. John that "they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover" (<a href="../../par/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>). What is meant in this passage by "the Passover" is not the Paschal lamb which had already been consumed, but probably the peace offering, or <span class="accented">chagigah</span>, which had to be offered and eaten on the first day of Unleavened Bread. The public sacrifices on each of the seven days of the week were two young bullocks, one ram, and seven Iambs for a burnt offering, with the accompanying meat offerings, and one goat for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19-24</a>). And these were followed by peace offerings made at the discretion of individuals, "according to the blessing of the Lord which he had given them" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-9.htm">Leviticus 23:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - A second command is given on the subject of the Feast of Unleavened Bread respecting those ceremonies which were only to be made use of when the Israelites had reached Canaan. It has reference to the second day of Unleavened Bread, which is called <span class="cmt_word">the morrow after the sabbath</span>, the first day of the feast being meant by <span class="accented">the sabbath</span>, on whatever day of week it may have occurred. It was on this second day that the presentation of the first or wave sheaf of barley took place, according to the command, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.</span> Which command was fulfilled in the following manner. "Already, on the 14th of Nisan, the spot whence the first sheaf was to be reaped bad been marked out by delegates from the Sanhedrim, by tying together in bundles, while still standing, the barley that was to be cut down. Though for obvious reasons it was customary to choose for the purpose the sheltered Ashes valley across Kedron, there was no restriction on that point, provided the barley had grown in an ordinary field - of course in Palestine itself - and not in garden or orchard land, and that the soil had not been manured nor yet artificially watered. When the time for cutting the sheaf had arrived, that is, on the evening of the 15th of Nisan (even though it was a sabbath)just as the sun went down, three men, each with a sickle and basket, formally set to work. But in order clearly to bring out all that was distinctive in the ceremony, they first asked of the bystanders three times each of these questions: 'Has the sun gone down?' 'With this sickle?' 'Into this basket?' ' On this sabbath?' (or first Passover day); and lastly, 'Shall I reap?' Having been each time answered in the affirmative, they cut down barley to the amount of one ephah, or ten omers, or three seahs, which is equal to about three pecks and three pints of our English measure. The ears were brought into the court of the temple" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The sheaf composed of these ears (for the Authorized Version is right in considering that it is the sheaf, and not the omer of flour made out of the ears of barley, that is meant by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, though Josephus and the Mishna take it the other way) was on the following day waved by the priests before the Lord, in token of its consecration, and through it, of the consecration of the whole barley crop to the Lord. With it was offered the burnt offering of a lamb, a meat offering double the usual quantity, and a drink offering. This passage and verses 18 and 37, are the only places in the Book of Leviticus where the drink offering is mentioned. Until the waving of the sheaf, <span class="cmt_word">neither bread nor parched corn, nor green ears</span>, that is, no grain in any form, might be eaten. We may imagine how delicacies made of the new flour would at once appear in the streets as soon as the sheaf had been waved.

It would have fallen about the beginning of June - a season of the year which would have made the journey to Jerusalem easy. The characteristic offering of the day was that of <span class="cmt_word">two wave loaves of two tenth deals... of fine flour...  baken with leaven.</span> These loaves were regarded as the firstfruits unto the Lord of the wheat harvest, although the greater part of the crop had now been reaped and housed. They were to be leavened and <span class="cmt_word">brought out of your habitations</span>; that is, they were to consist of such bread as was ordinarily used in daily life. They were made out of ears of wheat selected and cut like the barley in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and then threshed and ground in the temple court. Each loaf contained an omer of flour, amounting to about five pints, and would therefore have weighed about five pounds. With these were offered two lambs, which were waved before the Lord by being led backwards and forwards before the tabernacle or the temple, and then the loaves were waved also, but they were not placed upon the altar, as they were leavened. The twentieth verse, which is somewhat obscure in the Authorized Version, should be punctuated as follows. <span class="cmt_word">And the priest shall wave them</span> (the two lambs) <span class="cmt_word">with the bread of the firstfruits</span> (the two loaves) for <span class="cmt_word">a wave offering before the Lord; with the two lambs they</span> (the loaves) <span class="cmt_word">shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.</span> The other sacrifices to be offered on this day are described in the text as <span class="cmt_word">seven lambs,...  one young bullock, and two rams... for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings,... </span> and <span class="cmt_word">one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</span> In the Book of Numbers (Numbers 28:27) they are stated to be "seven lambs," "two young bullocks," "one ram," with meat and drink offerings, and "one kid of the goats." Seeing that in Leviticus <span class="accented">one young bullock and two rams</span> are commanded, and in Numbers "two young bullocks and one ram," it is reasonable to suppose that a copyist's error has found its way into one or the other text. The feast was to be kept as a day of holy convocation, and no servile work was to be done upon it. The number of sacrifices offered by individuals who had come to Jerusalem caused the festivity to be in practice continued for several days subsequent to the festival itself.

The first day of the seventh month we should expect to be holier than the first day of any other month, on account of the peculiar holiness of the seventh month, and because it was the beginning of the civil year. It is to be a sabbath; that is, a festival observed by rest, and <span class="cmt_word">a memorial of blowing of trumpets</span>. The latter words should be rather rendered a <span class="accented">memorial of a joyful noise.</span> That these joyful sounds were made by blowing the cornet, we may well believe from the testimony of tradition, but the text of Holy Scripture does not state the fact, and the use of the word <span class="accented">trumpets</span> in place of "cornets" leads to a confusion. Every new moon, and among them that of the seventh month, was observed by the blowing of trumpets (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>), but the trumpets then blown differed in their use and shape from the cornet. The trumpet was a long-shaped, metal instrument, at first used to give the signal for marching, afterwards to serve as the sign of the arrival of the monthly festival; the cornet was an animal's horn, or, if not a real horn, an instrument formed in the shape of a horn, and it was used to express joyful emotions, answering somewhat to our modern bell-ringing in the West, or firing unloaded guns in the East. Besides the blowing of trumpets, special sacrifices were appointed for the first of each month, "two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs," with their meat and drink offerings, for a burnt offering, and "one kid of the goats" for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). On New Year's Day, which, from its difference from the other new moons, was an annual as well as a monthly feast, the special offerings were "one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs," with their meat and drink offerings for a burnt offering, and "one kid of the goats" for a sin offering; and these were to be in addition to the offerings made on the first day of each month (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). It became a custom for the Levites to chant at the morning sacrifice <a href="../../par/psalms/81.htm">Psalm 81</a>, and at the evening sacrifice <a href="../../par/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>. The great joyfulness of the day is shown by the account given of its observance in the Book of Nehemiah. It was on the first day of the seventh month that Ezra read the Book of the Law publicly to the people, and when "the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law," Nehemiah and Ezra and the Levites said, "This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep....  Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength. So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-9.htm">Nehemiah 8:9-12</a>).

The eighth day is also <span class="cmt_word">a solemn assembly</span>. The meaning of the word <span class="accented">atzereth</span>, translated <span class="accented">a solemn assembly</span>, is doubtful.

The Jews gave the name to the Feast of Pentecost, as being the close of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. On each of the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles was to be offered an offering made by fire unto the Lord. The sacrifices to be offered are enumerated in <a href="../../par/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>. There were to be sacrificed two rams, and fourteen iambs, and bullocks diminishing by one a day from thirteen on the first day to seven on the last. These formed the burnt sacrifices. The sin offering on each day was one kid of the goats. On the eighth day the burnt offering consisted of one bullock, one ram, seven lambs, and the sin offering, as before, of one kid of the goats. Thus there were offered in all, in the eight days, seventy-one bullocks, fifteen rams, one hundred and five lambs, and eight kids, beside meat and drink offerings.
