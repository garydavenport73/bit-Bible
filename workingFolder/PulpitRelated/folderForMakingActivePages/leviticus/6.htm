<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/6-2.htm">Leviticus 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse would be better translated as follows: - <span class="cmt_word">If a soul sin,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and commit a trespass against the Lord, and falsely deny to his neighbour something that was delivered to him to keep, or something that he had received in pawn, or something that he had taken away by violence, or hath got something by oppression from his neighbour.</span> Cf. the injunction in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-11.htm">Leviticus 19:11</a>: "Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another." <a href="../../par/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-13</a> contains earlier legislation on the subject of things taken in trust.

This opened the way to false swearing where men were dishonest. <span class="cmt_word">Sinning therein.</span> Wrong to man is sin against God in every ease, but a special sin against God is committed when an appeal has been made to him by oath, and the oath has been false.

The further ritual of the burnt offering is exhibited in the particular instance of the lamb sacrificed every evening (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33</a>). In other cases the ritual was to be the same. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning,</span> the reading should be, <span class="accented">It, the burnt offering</span> (viz. the evening sacrifice), <span class="accented">shall burn upon the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning.</span> The priest is to wear his priestly dress already appointed (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>) - which was a white linen garment, covering the whole person like a close-fitting English surplice, fastened by a sash - while he is actually officiating at the altar; and thus vested, he is to remove from the altar <span class="cmt_word">the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering,</span> or rather, as it would be better translated, <span class="accented">the ashes to which the fire hath reduced the burnt offering</span>, and put them beside the altar, that is, on the ash-heap to the east of the altar. On leaving the court of the tabernacle, he is to change his dress, and to carry the ashes of the sacrifice <span class="cmt_word">without the camp unto a clean place</span>. The priest is also instructed to lay fresh wood on the altar fire every morning, in preparation for the morning sacrifice of the lamb (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>). The fat of the peace offerings, that is, the parts of the peace offerings that were burnt on the altar, were laid on the burnt offering. The altar fire was never to go out, because the daily sacrifices constantly burning on the altar symbolized the unceasing worship of God by Israel, and the gracious acceptance of Israel by God. The ever-burning sacrifice was the token of the people being in communion with God.

This meat offering, having first been offered at the consecration of Aaron, was afterwards to be offered at the consecration of each succeeding high priest, the expression <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and his sons</span> meaning here the successive high priests. The statement that the offering is to be <span class="cmt_word">perpetual</span>, has led to the belief that it was made every day by the high priest, from the time of his consecration onwards, and there is thought to be an allusion to this sacrifice in Ecclus. 45:14; but the more probable opinion is that it was only made on the day of consecration, that is, on the first day that he was qualified to act as high priest.
