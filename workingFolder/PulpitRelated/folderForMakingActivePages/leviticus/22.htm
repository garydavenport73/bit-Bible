At these times they are here instructed that they must abstain from their priestly functions, and not even eat of the priests' portions until they have been cleansed. The command to <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</span>, in verse 2, must be read in the light of the following verses, and understood to mean that they are <span class="accented">to separate themselves from the holy things</span> when they are unclean. The different forms of uncleanness which are to produce this effect are enumerated in verses 4-6. In most cases the uncleanness would not last beyond sunset on the day on which it was incurred, but occasionally, as when a priest became a leper, a permanent disqualification would be caused, or one that lasted for a considerable length of time. The law with respect to abstaining from holy things while unclean is to be of permanent obligation. Whoever disobeys it is to be <span class="cmt_word">cut off from God's presence</span>; that is, he is to be excluded from the sanctuary by being deprived of his priestly office. Verse 8 repeats the prohibition of eating flesh containing blood.

The answer is, the priest's family. The members of the priest's family here specified are those only about whom any question might have arisen, namely, the slaves, who, as bring incorporated into the priest's household, have a right of eating of the priestly food not enjoyed by lodgers in his house or by servants hired with his money; and married daughters who have returned to their father's roof in consequence of the death of their husband, or of being divorced, without any children of their own. Under these circumstances, it is ruled that they become once more a part of the priest's family, and able to exercise the privileges of that position. The priest's wife and sons and unmarried daughters are not here mentioned, as no question arose about them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/22-11.htm">Leviticus 22:11</a></div><div class="verse">But if the priest buy <i>any</i> soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.</div><div class="comm">

He thus acknowledged that he had "committed a trespass in the holy things of the Lord," the case falling under the rule given in chapter Leviticus 5:15, 16, "And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest." In the fifth chapter a trespass offering of a ram is also ordered, which, though not specified, is probably understood here also. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/22-15.htm">Leviticus 22:15</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - These verses present some difficulties of construction. The rendering of the Authorized Version is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord; or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the Lord do sanctify them.</span> If this rendering is accepted, it would mean that the priests are not to profane the holy things by any irregularity on their part as to the eating of them, nor to suffer laymen to incur the guilt of a trespass by eating them. The marginal rendering, which is to be preferred, gives the passage as follows: <span class="accented">And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">or lade themselves with the iniquity of trespass in their eating.</span> According to this translation, the meaning would be that laymen (who had been spoken of in the previous verse) should not profane the holy things, or become guilty of a trespass (as defined in verse 15) by eating them. Technically and literally, David was guilty of this trespass in an aggravated form, when he and his followers ate the shewbread at Nob (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>), for the shewbread was not only holy, but most holy. But his act is excused by our Lord, on the plea of necessity (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3, 4</a>), even though it was done on the sabbath day (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>, margin).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/22-17.htm">Leviticus 22:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-25.</span> - Just as the priests who offer to the Lord are to be ceremonially and morally holy, so the animals offered to him are to be physically perfect, in order <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to be types of a future perfect Victim, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to symbolize the "perfect heart"which God requires to be given to him, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to teach the duty of offering to him of our best. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever hath a blemish,</span> that <span class="cmt_word">shall ye not offer.</span> The list of blemishes and malformations which exclude from the altar is given; they are such as deform the animal, and make it less valuable: <span class="cmt_word">blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the Lord,</span> nor any animal that is <span class="cmt_word">bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut</span>, that is, castrated in any manner. The clause following the mention of castration - neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land - literally translated, <span class="accented">neither shall ye make in your land</span>, probably forbids castration altogether, not merely the offering of castrated animals in sacrifice. The expression, Ye shall offer at your own will, should be understood, as before, for <span class="accented">your acceptance</span> (see note on Leviticus 2:1). Only one exception is made as to blemished offerings: an animal <span class="cmt_word">that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts</span> may be offered for <span class="cmt_word">a freewill offering</span>, but not <span class="cmt_word">for a vow</span> (for the distinction of these offerings, see note on chapter Leviticus 2:1). These rules as to unblemished victims are to apply to the offerings of strangers as well as of Israelites.

During the young creature's first week of existence it is not considered as having arrived at the perfection of its individual and separate life, and therefore only from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the Lord. Up to what ago an animal might be offered is not stated. Gideon is narrated as offering a bullock of seven years old (<a href="../../par/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>).

A young animal and its mother are not to be killed (though reference is specially made to sacrifice, the general word, not the sacrificial term, for slaying is used) on the same day, just as the kid is not to be seethed in its mother's milk (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>), nor the mother bird be taken from the nest with the young (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>). Thus we see that the feelings of the human heart arc not to be rudely shocked by an act of apparent cruelty, even when no harm is thereby done to the object of that act. Mercy is to be taught by forbidding anything which may blunt the sentiment of mercy in the human heart.
