<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/11-2.htm">Leviticus 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These <i>are</i> the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that <i>are</i> on the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the beasts that ye shall eat.</span> In order that the Israelites might know how to avoid the uncleanness arising from the consumption of unclean flesh, plain rules are given them by which they may distinguish what flesh is clean and what is unclean. The first rule is that anything that dies of itself is unclean, whether it be beast, bird, or fish. The reasons of this are plain: for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the flesh still retains the blood, which no Israelite might eat; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> there is something loathsome in the idea of eating such flesh. Next, as to beasts, a class is marked off as edible by two plainly discernible characteristics, and instances are given to show that where there is any doubt owing to the animals possessing one of the characteristic marks only, the rule is to be construed strictly. As to fish and insects, equally plain rules, one in each case, are laid down; but as birds are not readily distinguished into large classes, the names of those that are unclean are given one by one, the remainder being all of them permissible. Thus the simple Israelite would run no risk of incurring uncleanness by inadvertently eating unclean food, whether of beast, bird, fish, or insect. The object of the regulations being to exclude all meats naturally offensive to the human taste, all carnivorous quadrupeds are shut out by the rule of chewing the cud (verse 3), with the same purpose, birds of prey and birds that eat offal are prohibited (verses 13-19), and scaleless fish on account of their repulsive appearance (verses 9-12), as well as beetles, maggots, and vermin of all sorts. In the case of beasts and fish, the rules laid down to mark off those things that are offensive, being general in their application, are such as to include in the forbidden class some few which do not appear naturally loathsome. This is owing partly to the difficulty of classification, partly to a change of feeling which experience has wrought in the sentiments of mankind with regard to such edibles as swine's flesh and shell-fish.

"They live in the natural caves and clefts of the rocks (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-18.htm">Psalm 104:18</a>), are very gregarious, being often seen seated in troops before the openings of their caves, and extremely timid, as they are quite defenseless (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-26.htm">Proverbs 30:26</a>). They are about the size of rabbits, of a brownish-gray or brownish-yellow color, but white under the belly; they have bright eyes, round ears, and no tail. The Arabs eat them, but do not place them before their guests" (Keil). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/11-6.htm">Leviticus 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof</span>, There is little doubt that the same animal as our hare is meant. Neither the hare, however, nor the hyrax chews the cud in the strict sense of the words. But they have the appearance of doing so. The rule respecting chewing the cud was given to and by Moses as a legislator, not as an anatomist, to serve as a sign by which animals might be known to be clean for food. Phenomenal not scientific language is used here, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>, "as we might speak of whales and their congeners as fish, when there is no need of scientific accuracy" (Clark). "All these marks of distinction in the Levitical law are wisely and even necessarily made on the basis of popular observation and belief, not on that of anatomical exactness. Otherwise the people would have been continually liable to error. Scientifically, the camel would be said to divide the hoof, and the hare does not chew the cud. But laws for popular use must necessarily employ terms as they are popularly understood. These matters are often referred to as scientific errors; whereas they were simply descriptions, necessarily popular, for the understanding and enforcement of the law" (Gardiner). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <i>is</i> unclean to you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted.</span> Here, again, the description is not according to anatomical analysis, but to ordinary appearance. The pig appears to be cloven-footed, and it would be misleading to give any other account of his foot in ordinary speech, but scientifically speaking, he has four toes. The prohibition of the use of swine's flesh does not arise from the fear of trichinosis or other disease, but from the disgust caused by the carnivorous and filthy habits of the Eastern pig. The repulsion originally felt for swine's flesh was natural, and, where the animal is carnivorous, is still natural, but where its habits are changed, and it has become simply graminivorous, the feeling has ceased to exist. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/11-8.htm">Leviticus 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they <i>are</i> unclean to you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of their carcass shall ye not touch.</span> This prohibition is founded upon the same feeling of disgust as the prohibition of eating their flesh. Whatever is foal must be avoided.

Eels and shell-fish are thus forbidden, though a long course of experience has now taken away the feeling of repulsion with which they were once looked upon. The flesh of the beasts for, bidden to be eaten is only described as unclean, but that of the prohibited fish, birds, insects, and vermin, is designated as <span class="cmt_word">an abomination unto you</span>.

It is probable that the words translated owl (verse 16), <span class="cmt_word">night hawk</span> (verse 16), <span class="cmt_word">cuckow</span> (verse 16) should be rendered, <span class="accented">ostrich, owl, gull</span>, and perhaps for <span class="cmt_word">swan</span> (verse 18), <span class="cmt_word">heron</span> (verse 19), <span class="cmt_word">lapwing</span> (verse 19), should be substituted <span class="accented">ibis, great plover, hoopoe.</span> In the case of the bat, we have again phenomenal language used.

None are allowed except the <span class="accented">Saltatoria</span>, or locust family. The word translated beetle signifies a sort of locust, like the other three words. That the locust was a regular article of food in Palestine is amply proved. "It is well known that locusts were eaten by many of the nations of antiquity, both in Asia and Africa, and even the ancient Greek thought the <span class="accented">cicadas</span> very agreeable in flavour (Arist. 'Hist. An.,' 5:30). In Arabia they are sold in the market, sometimes strung upon cords, sometimes by measure, and they are also dried and kept in bags for winter use....  They are generally cooked over hot coals, or on a plate, or in an oven, or stewed in butter, and eaten either with salt or with spice and vinegar, the head, wings, and feet being thrown away. They are also boiled in salt and water, and eaten with salt or butter. Another process is to dry them thoroughly, and then grind them into meal, and make cakes of them" (Keil). (Cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>.) The expression <span class="cmt_word">goeth upon all four</span>, means groveling or going in a horizontal position, in contrast with two-legged birds, just spoken of.
