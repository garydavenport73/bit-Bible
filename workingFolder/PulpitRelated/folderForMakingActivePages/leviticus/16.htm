THE CEREMONIAL PURIFICATION OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION ON THE GREAT DAY OF ATONEMENT. This chapter, containing the account of the institution of the ceremonial to be used on the Day of Atonement, would take its place chronologically immediately after the tenth chapter, for the instructions conveyed in it were delivered to Moses <span class="accented">"after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord and died"</span> (verse 1), when the fate of Nadab and Abihu would naturally have led Aaron to desire a more perfect knowledge than had as yet been imparted to him as to the manner in which he was to present himself before the Lord. Logically it might either occupy its present position, as being the great and culminating atoning and cleansing ceremony, or it might be relegated to a place among the holy days in chapter 23, where it is, in fact, shortly noticed. That it is placed here shows that the most essential characteristic of the Day in the judgment of the legislator is that of its serving as the occasion and the means of "making <span class="accented">an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and making an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and for making an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation"</span> (verse 33). Annually there gathered over the camp, and over the sanctuary as situated in the midst of the camp, a mass of defilement, arising in part from sins whose guilt had not been removed by the punishment of the offenders, and in part from uncleannesses which had not been cleansed by sacrifices and the prescribed ceremonial rites. Annually this defilement had to be atoned for or covered away from the sight of God. This was done by the solemn observance of the great Day of Atonement, and specially by the high priest's carrying the blood of the sacrifices into the holy of holies, into which he might enter on no other day of the year; while the consciousness of deliverance from the guilt of sin was quickened on the part of the people by their seeing the scapegoat <span class="accented">"bear</span> <span class="accented">away upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited"</span> (verse 22). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy <i>place</i> within the vail before the mercy seat, which <i>is</i> upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy</span> place <span class="cmt_word">within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark;</span> that he die not. Nadab and Abihu having died for their rash presumption in venturing unbidden into the tabernacle, it was natural that Aaron, who had as yet but once penetrated into the holy of holies, should be struck with fear, and that he should desire Divine instruction as to the times and manner in which he was to appear before the Lord, lest he should be struck dead like his sons. If the attempt to enter the outer chamber of the tabernacle had been so fatal to them, what might not be the result to him of entering <span class="accented">within the vail</span> which hung <span class="accented">before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark?</span> The mercy-seat  <span class="accented">- capporeth</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">propitiatorium -</span> formed the top of the ark, and was the place where God specially exhibited his Presence, on the occasions of his manifestation, by the bright <span class="accented">cloud</span> which then rested upon it between the cherubim. It was this Presence which made it perilous for Aaron to appear within the vail unbidden or without the becoming ritual; for man might not meet God unless he were sanctified for the purpose (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-14.htm">Exodus 19:14, 21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). The words, for <span class="cmt_word">I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat,</span> refer to the Divine Presence thus visibly manifested (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-12</a>), and not, as they have strangely been misinterpreted, to the cloud of smoke raised by the incense burnt by the high priest on his entrance. They do not, however, prove that the manifestation was constantly there, still less that it was continued, according to Jewish tradition, in later times. "The reason for the prohibition of Aaron's entrance at his own pleasure, or without the expiatory blood of sacrifice, is to be found in the fact that the holiness communicated to the priest did not cancel the sin of his nature, but only covered it over for the performance of his official duties; and so long as the Law, which produced only the knowledge of sin, and not its forgiveness and removal, was not abolished by the complete atonement, the holy God was and remained to mortal and sinful man a consuming fire, before which no one could stand" (Keil). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thus shall Aaron come into the holy <i>place</i>: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus shall Aaron come into the holy</span> place. "Thus" would be translated more literally by <span class="accented">With this.</span> He must come supplied with the specified offerings, dressed in the appointed manner and using the ceremonial here designated. The efficacy of the acts of the high priest on this day and throughout his ministrations depended not upon his individual but on his official character, and on his obedience to the various commandments positively enjoined. Personal worthiness would not qualify him for his service, nor personal unworthiness hinder the effect of his liturgical acts (cf. Art. 26, 'Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament'). Aaron's special offerings for himself on this great day are to be a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these <i>are</i> holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and <i>so</i> put them on.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - His special garments for the occasion are <span class="cmt_word">the holy linen coat</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">the linen breeches</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">a linen girdle</span>,...  <span class="cmt_word">and the linen mitre.</span> In the original the definite article is not expressed. The reading should therefore be, <span class="accented">He shall put on a holy linen coat, and he shall have linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with a linen mitre shall be attired.</span> The clothing was white from head to foot, differing therein from the dress of the ordinary priest, inasmuch as the sash or girdle of the latter was of variegated materials, and differing also in the shape of the mitre. The white clothing was not intended to symbolize humility and penitence, as some have thought, for white is not the colour in which penitents are naturally dressed. Rather it was symbolical of the purity and holiness which the ceremonies of the day symbolically affected, and which was specially needed to be exhibited in the person of the high priest. In the visions of Ezekiel and Daniel, the angel of God is clothed in <span class="accented">linen</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2, 3, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6, 7</a>). And the colour of the angelic raiment is described in the Gospels as <span class="accented">white:</span> "his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow" (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>); "they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment" (<a href="../../par/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>); "two men stood by them in shining garments" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>); she "seeth two angels in white sitting" (<a href="../../par/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>). So, too, the wife of the Lamb, in the Book of the Revelation, has it "granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints" (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). The white linen dress of the high priest, therefore (which must have given the appearance of the English surplice tied in at the waist), was intended to symbolize the purity and brightness which forms the characteristic of angels and saints, and, above all, of the King of saints. "The white material of the dress which Aaron wore when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of his nature, effected by himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by his own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us and obtain everlasting redemption (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12, 24</a>)" (Keil). The symbolism of the <span class="accented">holy garments</span> as indicating holiness and purity, is strengthened by the command that Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.</span> The high priest's acts on this day, so far as they are recounted in this chapter, were the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He bathed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He dressed himself in his white holy garments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He offered or presented at the door of the tabernacle a bullock for a sin offering for himself and his house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> He presented at the same place two goats for a sin offering for the congregation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> He cast lots on the two goats, one of which was to be sacrificed, the other to he let go into the wilderness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> He sacrificed the bullock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> He passed from the court through the holy place into the holy of holies with a censer and incense, and filled the space beyond the vail with a cloud of smoke from the incense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> He returned to the court, and, taking some of the blood of the bullock, passed again within the vail, and there sprinkled the blood once on the front of the mercy-seat and seven times before it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> He came out again into the court, and killed the goat on which the lot for sacrifice had fallen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">10.</span> For the third time he entered the holy of holies, and went through the same process with the goat's blood as with the bullock's blood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">11.</span> He purified the other part of the tabernacle, as he had purified the holy of holies, by sprinkling with the atoning blood, as before, and placing some of it on the horns of the altar of incense (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">12.</span> He returned to the court, and placed the blood of the bullock and goat upon the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice, and sprinkled it seven times. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">13.</span> He offered to God the remaining goat, laying his hands upon it, confessing and laying the sins of the people upon its head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">14.</span> He consigned the goat to a man, whose business it was to conduct it to the border of the wilderness, and there release it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">15.</span> He bathed and changed his linen vestments for his commonly worn high priest's dress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">16.</span> He sacrificed, one after the other, the two rams as burnt offerings for himself and for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">17.</span> He burnt the fat of the sin offerings upon the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">18.</span> He took measures that the remainder of the sin offerings should be burnt without the camp. In <a href="../../par/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7-11</a>, twelve sacrifices are commanded to be offered by the high priest on this day, namely, the morning and evening sacrifice; a burnt offering for the people, consisting of one young bullock, one ram (as already stated), and seven lambs; and cue goat for a sin offering; so that in all there were fifteen sacrifices offered, besides the meat and drink offerings. The punctiliousness of the Jews in later times was not content that the ceremonies should begin on the day itself. Preparations commenced a full week previously. On the third day of the seventh month, the high priest moved from his house in the city into the temple, and he was twice sprinkled with the ashes of the red heifer, by way of precaution against defilement. He spent the week in practicing and rehearsing, under the eye of some of the elders of the Sanhedrim, the various acts that he would have to perform on the great day, and on the night immediately preceding it he was not allowed to sleep. In case of his sudden death or disqualification, a substitute was appointed to fulfill his function. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-5.htm">Leviticus 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats.</span> It was necessary that the sacrifice offered for a person or class of persons should be provided by the offerer or offerers. The <span class="accented">two kids of the goats</span>, or rather the <span class="accented">two he-goats</span>, constituted together but one sin offering. This is important for the understanding of the sequel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which <i>is</i> for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Aaron shall offer his bullock...  and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.</span> The first step is an expiatory offering to reconcile the officiating priest and the remainder of the priestly house to God. This was necessary before his offerings for the people could be accepted. It indicates the defects inherent in a priest whose nature was only that of man, which is compassed about with infirmities. The <span class="accented">offering</span> here commanded is not the slaying, but the solemn presentation, of the bullock to the Lord. In after times the following form of confession was used by the high priest when he laid his hand upon the bullock: - "O Lord, I have committed iniquity; I have transgressed; I have sinned, I and my house. O Lord, I entreat thee, cover over the iniquities, the transgressions, and the sins which I have committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee, I and my house; even as it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, 'For on that day will he cover over for you, to make you clean; from all your transgressions before the Lord ye shall be cleansed" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - It must be carefully noted that. as the two goats made one sin offering (verse 5), so they are both <span class="cmt_word">presented before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> By this solemn presentation they became the Lord's, one as much as the other. After this, Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">cast lots upon the two goats.</span> The two goats, of the same size and appearance as far as possible, stood together near the entrance of the court. And by them was an urn containing two lots. These the high priest drew out at the same moment, placing one on the head of one goat, the other on the head of the other goat. According as the lot fell. one of the goats was taken and at once offered to the Lord, with a view to being shortly sacrificed; the other was appointed for a scapegoat, and reserved till the expiatory sacrifices had been made, when it too was offered to the Lord, and then sent away into the wilderness. After the lot had been chosen, the two goats were distinguished from each other by having a piece of scarlet cloth tied, the first round its neck, the second round its horn. <span class="cmt_word">One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</span> The last word is in the original <span class="accented">la-azazel</span>, and being found only in this chapter, it has caused a great discrepancy of opinion among interpreters as to its meaning. It has been diversely regarded as a place, a person, a thing, and an abstraction. The first class of interpreters explain it as some district of the wilderness; the second understand by it an evil spirit; the third take it as a designation of the goat; the fourth translate it, "for removal." The first interpretation may be summarily rejected. If a localized spot were meant, that spot would have been left behind by a people constantly on the move. The second hypothesis - that <span class="accented">azazel</span> was an evil spirit, or the evil spirit - has been embraced by so considerable a number of modern expositors, that it is necessary to dwell upon it at some length. But, indeed, it has little to recommend it. It has been argued that <span class="accented">azazel</span> must be a proper name, because it has no article prefixed to it, <span class="accented">la-azazel.</span> This is a grammatical error. When a noun expresses an office or a function, and has the preposition <span class="accented">le</span> or <span class="accented">la</span> prefixed to it, it does not take an article in Hebrew any more than in French; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the verse, "Jehu...  shalt thou anoint to be king (or for king) over Israel; and Elisha...  shalt thou appoint to be prophet (or for prophet) in thy room" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>), the Hebrew is <span class="accented">le-melek</span> and <span class="accented">le-navi</span>, without the article. The same idiom will be found in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>. With greater plausibility it is argued that verse 8 contrasts Jehovah and Azazel, and that if <span class="accented">la-Yehovah</span> be translated "for Jehovah," or "for the Lord," <span class="accented">la-azazel</span> must be translated "for Azazel." It may be allowed that there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> likelihood that, where words are thus contrasted, if one designates a person, the other would designate a person. But it is an incredibly rash assertion that this is always the case. All depends upon the idea which the speaker or writer has in his mind and desires to express. As part of the same argument, it is urged that the preposition, being the same in both clauses of the sentence, must be translated by the same word. This is certainly not the case. The natural meaning of <span class="accented">le</span> with a proper name is "for," and with a word expressing the performance of some function (technically called <span class="accented">nomen agentis</span>) it means "to be" (see the passage quoted above from <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). Unless, therefore, <span class="accented">azazel</span> be a proper name (which has to be proved, not assumed)the preposition need not and ought not to be translated by "for" but by "to be." The word <span class="accented">le</span> is used with great latitude, and often in a different sense in the same sentence; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>. The objections to the theory that <span class="accented">azazel</span> means an evil spirit are of overwhelming force. It will be enough to name the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The name <span class="accented">azazel</span> is nowhere else mentioned. This could not be, if he were so important a being as to divide with Jehovah the sin offering of the congregation of Israel on the great Day of Atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> No suitable etymology can be discerned. The nearest approach to it is very forced - "the separated one." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The notion of appeasing, or bribing, or mocking the evil spirit by presenting to him a goat, is altogether alien from the spirit of the rest of the Mosaic institutions. Where else is there anything like it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The goat is presented and offered to Jehovah equally with the goat which is slain. To take that which has been offered (and therefore half sacrificed) to God and give it to Satan, would be a daring impiety, which is inconceivable. That <span class="accented">la-azazel</span> means "for removal" is the opinion of Bahr, Tholuck, Winer, and others. There is nothing objectionable in this interpretation, but the form of the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> points rather to an agent than to an abstract act. <span class="accented">Azazel</span> is a word softened (according to a not unusual custom) from <span class="accented">azalzel</span>, just as <span class="accented">kokav</span> is a softened form of <span class="accented">kay-kay</span>, and as Babel is derived from Balbel (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>). <span class="accented">Azalzel is</span> an active participle or participial noun, derived ultimately from <span class="accented">azal</span> (connected with the Arabic word <span class="accented">azala</span>, and meaning removed), but immediately from the reduplicate form of that verb, <span class="accented">azazal.</span> The reduplication of the consonants of the root in Hebrew and Arabic gives the force of repetition, so that while <span class="accented">azal</span> means removed, <span class="accented">azalzal</span> means removed by a repetition of acts. <span class="accented">Azalzel</span>, or <span class="accented">azazel</span>, therefore, means one who removes by a series of acts. <span class="accented">"In</span> this sense the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> is strictly expressive of the function which is ascribed to the scapegoat in verses 21, 22; namely, that he <span class="accented">be sent away, bearing upon him all the iniquities of the children of Israel into the wilderness.'</span> It properly denotes one that removes or separates; yet a remover in such sort that the removal is not effected by a single act or at one moment, but by a series of minor acts tending to and issuing in a complete removal. No word could better express the movement of the goat before the eyes of the people, as it passed on, removing at each step, in a visible symbol, their sins further and further from them, until, by continued repetition of the movement, they were carried far away and removed utterly" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). That it is the goat that is designated by the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> is the exposition of the LXX., Josephus, Symmachus, Aquila, Theodotion, the Vulgate, the Authorized English Version, and Luther's Version. The interpretation is founded on sound etymological grounds, it suits the context wherever the word occurs, it is consistent with the remaining ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and it accords with the otherwise known religious beliefs and symbolical practices of the Israelites. The two goats were the single sin offering for the people; the one that was offered in sacrifice symbolized atonement or covering made by shedding of blood, the other symbolized the utter removal of the sins of the people, which were conveyed away and lost in the depths of the wilderness, whence there was no return. Cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us;" and <a href="../../par/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>, "He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea." The eighth verse should be translated as it stands in the Authorized Version, or, if we ask for still greater exactness, <span class="accented">And Aaron shall east lots upon the two goats</span>; <span class="accented">one lot for the Lord, and one lot for a remover of sins.</span>

But the goat, upon which fell the lot for a remover of sins, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to send him away for a remover of sins into the wilderness.</span> We are justified in inserting the words, "of sins," after "a remover," because "the use of the word <span class="accented">azal</span>, from which the word rendered by 'remover' is derived, is confined in the Hebrew dialect to the single purpose or institution which is here under consideration; so that this particular word must have conveyed to the mind of a Hebrew hearer or reader this notion of a removal of <span class="accented">sins</span>, and none other" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). The goat is both <span class="cmt_word">presented before the Lord,</span> and subsequently (verse 20) offered to him, the priest laying his hands upon him and making a confession of the sins of the people. After he has thus become the Lord's, how could he be given up to Satan? The purpose of his being set apart <span class="cmt_word">is to make an atonement with him</span> (not <span class="accented">for him</span>, as some commentators explain it wrongly). As atonement was made by the blood of the sacrificed goat ceremonially covering sin, so it was also made by the live goat symbolically removing sin. But the atonement in both cases has reference to God. How could an atonement be made by an offering to Satan, unless Satan, not God, was the being whose wrath was to be propitiated, and with whom reconciliation was sought?

Here we see taught the lesson of the vision of God, as he is, being impossible to the human faculties. He must be vailed in one way or another. After passing through the outer chamber of the tabernacle, the high priest found himself in the smaller chamber where stood the ark. Immediately he threw the incense on the coals of the censer, until the holy of holies was filled with the smoke, after which, according to later practice, he offered a prayer outside the vail. The following form of prayer, breathing, however, the spirit of ages long subsequent to the tabernacle, or even the first temple, is found in the Talmud: -  "May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that neither this day nor this year any captivity come upon us. Yet if captivity befall us this day or this year, let it be to a place where the Law is cultivated. May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that want come not upon us this day or this year. But if want visit us this day or this year, let it be due to the liberality of our charitable deeds. May it please thee, O Lord, the God of our fathers, that this year may be a year of cheapness, of fullness, of intercourse and trade; a year with abundance of rain, of sunshine, and of dew; one in which thy people Israel shall not require assistance one from another. And listen not to the prayers of those who are about to set out on a journey (against rain). And as to thy people Israel, may no enemy exalt himself against them. May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that the houses of the men of Saron (exposed to floods) may not become their graves" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service').

There remained the outer chamber of the tabernacle and the altar of burnt sacrifice to be atoned for. Accordingly, the high priest proceeds to do <span class="cmt_word">so for the tabernacle of the congregation,</span> that is, to make a similar atonement by similar means outside the vail as he had made inside it. He would therefore have made one sprinkling with the blood upon the vail, and seven sprinklings before it, after which he placed the blood upon the horns of the altar of incense, according to the command given in <a href="../../par/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>.

Even on the Day of Atonement the dwelling-place of God, typical of heaven, was closed to the eye and foot of man, "the way into the holiest of all being not yet made manifest" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-8.htm">Hebrews 9:8</a>), until the Divine High Priest opened the way for his people by his own entrance.

It was not enough that the defilement of the sanctuary should be covered, and the sins of the priests and people atoned for by the blood of the sacrifices. There remained a consciousness of sin. How was this to be taken away? To effect this, Aaron proceeds to the unique ceremony of the day by which the utter removal of sin from the reconciled people is typified. <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring the live goat;</span> this should be translated <span class="accented">offer the live goat.</span> It is the word used above for the <span class="accented">offering</span> of the goat that was slain, and it is the word always used for offering sacrifices to the Lord. The first goat had been offered in the usual manner, the offerer laying his hand on his head and perhaps praying over him. Now the second goat is offered, the high priest having to <span class="cmt_word">lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,...  putting them upon the head of the goat.</span> The confession of sins, at first extempore, would naturally, as time progressed, become stereotyped into a liturgical form, as it is found in the Mishna: "O Lord, they have committed iniquity; they have transgressed; they have sinned, - thy people, the house of Israel. O Lord, cover over, I entreat thee, their iniquities, their transgressions, and their sins, which they have wickedly committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee,  - thy people, the house of Israel. As it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, saying, ' For on that day shall it be covered over for you, to make you clean; from all your sins before the Lord ye shall be cleansed'" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service '). During this confession of sins the people remained prostrate in humiliation and prayer in the court of the tabernacle, and it was the custom of the high priest to turn towards them as he pronounced the last words, "Ye shall be cleansed." At the conclusion of the confession, the high priest handed over the goat to a fit man, that is, to a man who was standing ready to take charge of him, and <span class="cmt_word">sent him away by his hand into the wilderness.</span>

The goat is to bear the iniquities of the people <span class="cmt_word">unto a land not inhabited.</span> The latter words - in the original, <span class="accented">eretz gezerah - would</span> be more correctly translated, <span class="accented">a laud cut off</span>, that is, completely isolated from the surrounding country by some barrier of rock or torrent, which would make it impossible for the goat to come back again. Thus the sins were utterly lost, as though they had never been, and they could not return to the sanctified people. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">gazar</span>, to cut (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-25.htm">1 Kings 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-18.htm">Psalm 136:18</a>), is represented in Arabic by <span class="accented">jazara</span>, and the substantive <span class="accented">gezerah</span> by <span class="accented">jaziruh</span>, which means an island, or an area surrounded by rivers. The word is still in use in countries where Arabic is spoken, as the designation of a district divided from the neighbouring territories by rivers cutting it off, and making it a sort of island or peninsula. Into such a district as this, the man who led the goat was <span class="cmt_word">to let him go.</span> In later times, contrary to the spirit of the Mosaic appointment, the goat was pushed over a projecting ledge of rock, and so killed, a device of man clumsily introduced for the purpose of perfecting a symbolism of Divine appointment. It was more in accordance with the original institution that "the arrival of the goat in the wilderness was immediately telegraphed by the waving of flags, from station to station, till a few minutes after its occurrence it was known in the temple, and whispered from ear to ear, that the goat had borne upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). Both the goat that was sacrificed and the goat that served as remover of sins typified Christ. The first presents him to our faith as the Victim on the cross, the other as the Sin-bearer on whom the Lord laid "the iniquity of us all" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). "The reason for making use of two animals is to be found purely in the physical impossibility of combining all features that had to be set forth in the sin offering in one animal" (Keil).

The high priest, having sent away the man with the goat, recited the passages of Scripture which commanded the observance of the Day of Atonement (chapters 16; 23:27-32; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7-11</a>), and offered prayers in which the people might mentally join.

If there are any, therefore, who, in considering the Levitical ritual of the great Day of Atonement, and in looking at the two he-goats - the one sacrificed, the other let go, charged with <span class="accented">sins</span>, into the wilderness - do not recognize the one Christ who died for our <span class="accented">sins</span> and took away our <span class="accented">sins</span>, and do not see there the 'everlasting statute' of which God here speaks by Moses, let him go up thrice a year to Jerusalem, and there search for the altar which has crumbled in the dust, and offer up his victims there without a priest. But no; thanks be to God, the earthly priesthood and temple are abolished, that we may raise our heart to the heavenly, and look up with faith and love and joy to him who offered himself once for all, and who ever liveth to make intercession for us" (Origen, 'Hom.' 10, as quoted by Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And he did as the Lord commanded Moses</span>; that is. Moses announced to Aaron the Law which was to be carried out about five months later. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../leviticus/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Leviticus 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../leviticus/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Leviticus 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
