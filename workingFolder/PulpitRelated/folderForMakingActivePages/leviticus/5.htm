If a man <span class="cmt_word">hear the voice of swearing</span>, that is, if he was one of a number of persons adjured to speak according to the manner in which oaths were administered in Jewish courts of justice (see <a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-15.htm">2 Chronicles 18:15</a>), and he did not give evidence of what he had seen or heard, he had to <span class="cmt_word">bear his iniquity</span>, that is, he was regarded as guilty; and as this was an offense which could be atoned for by a sacrifice, he was to offer as a sin offering a ewe lamb, or a female kid, or two turtle-doves, or two pigeons, or the tenth part of an ephah of flour. This injunction is a direct condemnation of the approved teaching of Italian moral theologians of paramount authority throughout the Roman Church, who maintain that, in case a crime is not known to others, a witness in a court of justice "may, nay, he is bound to, say that the accused has not committed it" (St. Alfonso de' Liguori, 'Theol. Mor.,' 4:154).

If he had touched a dead body or any other substance conveying uncleanness, and it <span class="cmt_word">were hidden from him</span>, that is, if he had done it unwittingly, or from forgetfulness or neglect, had failed to purify himself immediately, he must offer his sin offering, as above.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with <i>his</i> lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever <i>it be</i> that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth <i>of it</i>, then he shall be guilty in one of these.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The ease of a man who had neglected to fulfill a thoughtless oath.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these <i>things</i>, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that <i>thing</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - In the four cases last mentioned there is first to be an acknowledgment of guilt, <span class="cmt_word">he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing</span>, and then the sin offering is to be made. Confession of sin probably preceded or accompanied all sin offerings. The use of the word <span class="accented">asham</span>, translated <span class="cmt_word">trespass offering</span> in verse 6, and the character of the four cases have led many commentators to regard verses 1-13 as dealing with the trespass offering rather than the sin offering. But if this were so, the words <span class="accented">trespass offering</span> and <span class="accented">sin offering</span> would be used synonymously in this verse, which is very unlikely, when they are immediately afterwards carefully distinguished. It is best to render <span class="accented">asham</span> "for his trespass," that is, in expiation of his guilt, as in the next verse, in place of a <span class="accented">trespass offering.</span>

There is thus typically set forth the freedom with which acceptance through the great propitiation is offered to all without respect of persons. The non-bloody substitute, being permitted only as an exception for the benefit of the very poor and only in the four cases above specified, does not invalidate the general rule that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 5:14-19

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a></div><div class="verse">If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16</span> refer to sins of omission, offenses <span class="cmt_word">in the holy things of the Lord</span>; that is, withholding tithes and offerings. The non-payment of tithes and offerings was looked upon as robbing Jehovah (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>), and therefore it is that a trespass offering, involving compensation, and not only a sin offering, is required to atone for the offense. The ram that is to be offered is to be of a value fixed by the priest (<span class="cmt_word">with thy estimation</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the estimation of the priest), and the priest is to estimate it <span class="cmt_word">by shekels of silver</span>; implying that its value must amount at least to <span class="accented">shekels</span> (in the plural), meaning two shekels (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, where "portions" means "more than one portion," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "two portions"). The shekel is considered to be equal to 2s. 7d. The <span class="cmt_word">shekel of the sanctuary</span> means the shekel according to its exact weight and value, while still unworn by traffic and daily use. Beside offering the rain, he is to <span class="cmt_word">make amends for the harm</span> (or rather <span class="accented">sin</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that he hath clone in the holy thing, and.. . add the fifth part.</span> The fifth part is probably appointed as being the same as two-tenths of the principal sum. Full satisfaction is the marked feature of the trespass offering. In <a href="../../par/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>, "Zacchaeus stood, and said,...  Behold, Lord,...  if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold." He went far beyond his legal obligation in respect to compensation. (Cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a>, "He shall restore the lamb fourfold.")
