<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Washing, robing, anointing, sacrificing, are the four means by the joint operation of which the consecration is effected. The washing, or bathing, took place in the sight of the people. The whole of the person, except so much as was covered by the linen drawers (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>), was <span class="cmt_word">washed</span>. The symbolical significance is clear. Cleansing from sin precedes clothing in righteousness and spiritual unction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound <i>it</i> unto him therewith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - The robing. The various articles of the priestly dress had been appointed and described before (<a href="../../par/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 29</a>). In these verses we see the order in which they were <span class="cmt_word">put on</span>. After the priests had, no doubt, changed their linen drawers, there came, first, <span class="cmt_word">the coat</span>, that is, a close-fitting tunic of white linen, made with sleeves and covering the whole body; <span class="cmt_word">next the girdle</span> of the tunic, that is, a linen sash for tying the tunic round the body, with variegated ends hanging on each side to the ankles; thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the robe</span>, that is, a blue vesture, woven of one piece, with holes for the head and arms to pass through, reaching from the neck to below the knee, the bottom being ornamented with blue, purple, and scarlet pomegranates, alternating with golden bells; fourthly, <span class="cmt_word">the ephod</span>, which consisted of two shoulder-pieces, or epaulettes, made of variegated linen and gold thread, fastened together in front and at the back by a narrow strap or band, from which hung, before and behind the wearer, two pieces of cloth confined below by <span class="cmt_word">the curious girdle of the ephod</span>, that is, by a sash made of the same material as the ephod itself. Into the ephod were sewn two onyxes, one on each shoulder, in gold filigree settings, one of them engraven with the names of half of the tribes, and the other with the remaining half; and from two rosettes or buttons by the side of these stones depended twisted gold chains for the support of the breastplate. Fifth came <span class="cmt_word">the breastplate</span>, which was a square pocket, made of embroidered linen, a span long and a span broad, worn upon the breast and hanging from the gold chains above mentioned, the lower ends of the gold chain being tied to two rings at the upper and outer corner of the breastplate, while the upper and inner corner of the same was attached to the ephod by blue thread running through two sets of rings in the breastplate and ephod respectively. The outer side of the breastplate was stiffened and adorned by twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three, each stone having on it the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The breastplate being double and the two sides and the bottom being sewn up, the pocket formed by it had its opening at the top. Into this pocket were placed <span class="cmt_word">the Urim and the Thummim</span>, which were probably two balls of different colours, one of which on being drawn out indicated the approval of God, and the other his disapproval, as to any point on which the high priest consulted him. (The Jewish tradition, that the Divine answer by the Urim and the Thummim came by a supernatural light thrown on certain letters in the names of the tribes, has no foundation.) The last part of the dress to be put on was <span class="cmt_word">the mitre</span>, or head-dress of linen, probably of the nature of a turban; to which, by a blue string, was attached <span class="cmt_word">the golden plate</span>, in such a way that it rested lengthwise on the forehead, and on this plate or <span class="cmt_word">holy crown</span> were inscribed the words," Holiness to the Lord." The investiture took place <span class="cmt_word">as the Lord commanded Moses</span>, that is, in accordance with the instructions given in <a href="../../par/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. Its purpose and its meaning in the eyes of the people would have been twofold: first, after the manner of the king's crown and the judge's robe, it served to manifest the fact that the function of priest was committed to the wearer; and next, it symbolized the necessity of being clothed upon with the righteousness of God, in order to be able to act as interpreter and mediator between God and man, thus foreshadowing the Divine Nature of him who should be the Mediator in antitype. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.</div><div class="comm">

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that <i>was</i> therein, and sanctified them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - The anointing is still more specifically the means of consecration than the investing or the washing. (For <span class="cmt_word">the anointing oil</span>, which is here referred to as a thing well known, see <a href="../../par/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-25</a>, where its component parts are designated.) The consecration of things as well as of persons is sanctioned by the action of Moses, who <span class="cmt_word">anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them</span>. They were thus set apart for holy purposes. By <span class="accented">all that was therein</span> would be meant the ark, the vail, the altar of incense, the candlesticks, the table of show-bread. After the tabernacle and its furniture had been anointed, the altar - that is, the brazen altar - <span class="cmt_word">and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot</span>, were sprinkled; not once only, as the things within the tabernacle, but <span class="cmt_word">seven times</span>, to show that it was specially holy, although situated only in the court. <span class="accented">The laver</span>, for the priests' use, was between the door of the tabernacle and the brazen altar of burnt offering. Its <span class="accented">foot</span>, or base, is described in <a href="../../par/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>, as made, according to the translation of the Authorized Version, "of brass, of the looking-glasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a></div><div class="verse">And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head</span>. The change of the verb <span class="accented">poured</span> for <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>, indicates that the amount of "the precious ointment" poured "upon the head, that ran down unto the beard, and went down to the skirts of his garments" (<a href="../../par/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), was far greater than that with which the furniture of the tabernacle had been anointed. The oil sprinkled on the holy things sanctified them as means of grace. The oil poured upon Aaron represents the grace of the Holy Spirit, coming from without, but diffusing itself over and throughout the whole consecrated man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-13.htm">Leviticus 8:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The investiture of <span class="cmt_word">Aaron's sons</span>  - Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, Ithamar - follows the consecration of their father. They are robed, according as <span class="cmt_word">the Lord commanded Moses</span> in <a href="../../par/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>, in the white tunic, the sash, and the cap. But there is no statement here of their being anointed, although their anointing is ordered in <a href="../../par/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>, and still more imperatively in <a href="../../par/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>. They are spoken of as "anointed" in <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-36.htm">Leviticus 7:36</a>, and as having "the anointing oil of the Lord upon them" in <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>. On the other hand, the high priest is specially designated as "the priest that is anointed" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). It is probable that the personal anointing of the ordinary priests was confined to their being sprinkled with oil, as described below in verse 30; but that they were regarded as virtually anointed in Aaron's anointing. The Levites had no special dress until they obtained permission from Herod Agrippa I[. to wear the priestly robes (Joseph., 'Ant.,' 20:09, 6). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-32.</span> - After the bathing, the robing, and the anointing, follow the sacrifices of consecration - the sin offering (verses 14-17), the burnt offering (verses 18-21), the peace offering (verses 22-32). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sin offering.</span> This was the first sin offering ever offered. There had been burnt offerings and sacrifices akin to peace offerings before, but no sin offerings. At once the sin offering takes its place as the first of the three sacrifices before the burnt offerings and peace offerings. Justification comes first, then sanctification, and, following upon them, communion with God. The victim offered by and for Aaron and his sons is a bullock, the same animal that is appointed for the offering of the high priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a></div><div class="verse">And he slew <i>it</i>; and Moses took the blood, and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses took the blood.</span> Moses continues still to act as priest, and the new sacrifice is once offered by him. He performs the priestly act of presenting the blood; but on this occasion, which is special, the blood is not dealt with in the manner prescribed for the high priest's offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6</a>). The reason of this is that Aaron was not yet high priest, and also that the offering was made not only for Aaron, but also for his sons; and further, the blood as well as the anointing oil was required to <span class="cmt_word">purify the altar, and sanctify it</span> (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>). Although the blood was not "brought into the tabernacle," yet the bullock was <span class="cmt_word">burnt with fire without the camp,</span> not eaten according to the rule of <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26, 30</a>. This was necessary, as there were as yet no priests to eat it.

This portion consisted of the internal fat and tail, which was usually burnt (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>), and the heave offering of <span class="cmt_word">the right shoulder</span>, or hind leg, which generally went to the officiating priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>), and one of each of the unleavened cakes. After this special ceremony of waving, peculiar to the rite of consecration, the usual wave offering (the breast) was waved by Moses and consumed by himself. Ordinarily it was for the priests in general (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>). The blood was poured on the side of the altar, as was done in all peace offerings, but in addition, on the present occasion, it was <span class="cmt_word">put upon the tip of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right ear</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">upon the thumb of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right hand</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">upon the great toe of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right foot</span> of the priests who were being consecrated, symbolizing that their senses and active powers were being devoted to God's service. The same ceremony is to be used in the restoration of the leper (see chapter Leviticus 14:14).
