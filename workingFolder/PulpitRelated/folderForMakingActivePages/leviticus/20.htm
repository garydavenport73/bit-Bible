For example, the sin of "giving of his seed to Molech," or which is the same thing, "letting any of his seed pass through the fire to Molech," had been forbidden as a sin in chapter Leviticus 18:21; now it is condemned as a crime. The various penalties assigned in this chapter are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">burning with fire</span> (verse 14); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">stoning with stones</span> (verses 2, 27); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">being put to death</span> in a manner not specified  (verses 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">being cut off from among his people</span>, either by God himself (verses 4, 5, 6) or by an agency not specified (verses 17, 18); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <span class="accented">bearing his iniquity</span> (verses 17, 19, 20); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">childlessness</span> (verses 20, 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first of these penalties, <span class="accented">burning with fire</span>, does not mean that those on whom it was inflicted were burnt alive, but that their dead bodies were burnt after they had been stoned to death, as in the case of Achan (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>). It is the punishment for taking a mother and daughter together into the same harem (verse 14). <span class="accented">Stoning with stones</span> is appointed for crimes which are at once offenses against religion and morals, viz. giving of his seed to Molech (verse 2), and witchcraft (verse 27). The other form of <span class="accented">putting to death</span>, which no doubt was strangling, is the penalty assigned to cursing parents (verse 9), adultery (verse 10), marriage or intercourse with a stepmother (verse 11) or stepdaughter (verse 12), the sin of Sodom (verse 13), and bestiality (verses 15, 16). <span class="accented">Cutting off from his people</span> may be effected either by death (verses 4, 5, and perhaps 6), which is the penalty for Molech-worship, connivance at Molech-worship, and dealing with witches; or by excommunication (verses 17, 18), which was the punishment for intercourse with a sister, or with one who was unclean by reason of her monthly sickness (see <a href="../../par/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>). The phrase, <span class="accented">bearing his iniquity</span>, means that the man continues in the state of a criminal until he has been cleansed either by suffering the punishment of his offense or making atonement for it, which sometimes he might, sometimes he might not, do. The man who committed incest with a sister would <span class="accented">"bear</span> <span class="accented">his iniquity"</span> (verse 17), because he would be put in a state of excommunication without permission of restoration by means of sacrificial offerings. And so with the man who took his aunt by blood (verse 19) or by marriage (verse 20) as his wife, - he would not be allowed to recover his status by offering sacrifice. <span class="accented">Childlessness</span>, the punishment for marrying an uncle's or brother's wife, probably means that in those cases the offender's children should not be counted as his own, but should be entered in the genealogical register as his uncle's or his brother's children. (Cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-10.htm">Deuteronomy 25:10</a>, where it is noticeable that the penalty is retained, even though the marriage with the brother's wife, which had been prohibited in general, had in the particular case become a duty for family or tribal reasons.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever <i>he be</i> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth <i>any</i> of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - The close connection between <span class="cmt_word">giving of his seed unto Molech</span> and <span class="cmt_word">defiling my sanctuary</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">profaning my holy name</span>, is explained and illustrated by Ezekiel in the judgment on Aholah and Aholibah. "They have caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them. Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37-39</a>). Not only was the juxtaposition and combination of the worship of Molech and Jehovah an offense to him whose name is Jealous, but at the time that Molech-worship was carried on in the valley of Hinnom, idols were set up in the court of the temple itself, as we learn from the Book of Kings and from Jeremiah. "But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my Name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which! commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34, 35</a>). And of Manasseh it is related, "He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put my Name. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. And he made his son pass through the fire" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/20-4.htm">Leviticus 20:4</a></div><div class="verse">And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - There is to be no connivance with Molech-worship. The penalty is death, and is to be carried out by the proper tribunals, whose business it was to see that the stoning took place. So in Deuteronomy the duty of killing those who entice to idolatry is laid down. "Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shall thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-8.htm">Deuteronomy 13:8, 9</a>). In the case of Molech-worship God declares that, if the tribunals of the nation fail to adjudge the penalty of death to the offender, he will himself lake the matter into his hands, and cut him off with his family and all that follow him in his sin of unfaithfulness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/20-5.htm">Leviticus 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.</div><div class="comm">

The only way in which the nation can recover holiness lost by the sins of its members, is by the punishment of the latter, or by their purification by means of sacrifice, according to the nature of the offense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/20-8.htm">Leviticus 20:8</a></div><div class="verse">And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I <i>am</i> the LORD which sanctify you.</div><div class="comm">

God says that a man who <span class="cmt_word">curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.</span> Human authority, incontrovertible throughout a great part of Christendom, declares that in most cases it is no grave sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the man that committeth adultery with <i>another</i> man's wife, <i>even he</i> that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The Hebrew punishment for adultery is more severe than that of most other nations. Death is again pronounced as the penalty of both adulterer and adulteress in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>. The crime is that of a man with a married woman, whether the man be married or not; it is not that of a married man with an unmarried woman, which, in a country where polygamy was allowed, could not be regarded in the same light.
