Timothy was St. Paul's own son, because he had begotten him in the gospel (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>) - his spiritual son. This is best expressed as in the A.V. by "in the faith" (comp. <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>, where the same idea is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace, mercy, and peace.</span> This varies from the blessing at the beginning of the Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians, by the addition of the word "mercy," as in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a> in the T.R., and also in 2 John 3 and <a href="../../par/jude/1-2.htm">Jude 1:2</a>. It seems in St. Paul to connect itself with that deeper sense of the need and of the enjoyment of mercy which went with his deepening sense of sin as he drew towards his end, and harmonizes beautifully with what he says in vers. 12-16. The analogy of the other forms of blessing quoted above strongly favors the sense <span class="cmt_word">our Father</span> rather than <span class="accented">the Father</span>. Whether we read <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> with the T.R. or omit it with the R.T., the idea of <span class="accented">Father</span> is contrasted, not with that of <span class="accented">Son</span>, but with that of <span class="accented">Lord</span>; the two words express the relation of the Persons of the Godhead, not to each other, but to the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Exhorted</span> for <span class="accented">besought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tarry</span> for <span class="accented">abide still</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was going</span> for <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">certain men</span> for <span class="accented">some</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">not to teach a different</span> for <span class="accented">that they teach no other</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Exhorted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). In about sixty places this word has the sense of "beseech," "entreat," "desire," "pray," which is more suitable to this passage than the R.V. <span class="accented">exhort</span>. It is a strong expression, and seems to imply that Timothy had been anxious to go with St. Paul to Macedonia, to share his labors and wait upon him; but that St. Paul, with that noble disinterestedness which characterized his whole life, had, not without difficulty, persuaded him to abide at Ephesus. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry</span>. Here again the R.V. is unfortunate. The exact sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is "to stay on," or, as in the A.V., "to abide still." The word tells us that Timothy was already at Ephesus when he received the request from St. Paul to stay on there instead of going to Macedonia. There is nothing in the phrase that implies that St. Paul was at Ephesus himself when he made the request to Timothy. It may have been made by message or by letter. <span class="cmt_word">When I was going.</span> Some commentators have endeavored to explain <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as applying to Timothy, or as if the order were <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>; but the Greek will not admit of it. <span class="cmt_word">Charge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>); a word implying authority, almost invariably rendered "command" or "charge." It is taken up in ver. 18 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), "This charge," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Teach a different doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is one of the many words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles. It only occurs here and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>. It is formed from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a teacher of other than right doctrine, and means "to play the part of a teacher of other than right doctrine," just as in ecclesiastical language <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "one who holds opinions contrary to that which is orthodox," and such as do so are said <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. The classical sense is a little different, "one who holds a different opinion" - "to be of a different opinion." The introduction of the word into the vocabulary of Scripture is a sign of the somewhat later age to which this Epistle belongs, when heresies were growing and multiplying. Other similar compounds are <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).

If the spirit which gave birth to the fables of the Talmud was already at work among the Jews, we have a ready explanation of the phrase. And that they were Jewish fables (not later Gnostic delusions) is proved by the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>, "Not giving heed to Jewish fables." The prevalence of sorcery among the Jews at this time is a further instance of their inclination to fable (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Endless genealogies.</span> What was the particular abuse of genealogies which St. Paul here condemns we have not sufficient historical knowledge to enable us to decide. But that they were Jewish forms of "vain talking," and not Gnostic, and related to human pedigrees, not to "emanations of eons," may be concluded from the connection in which they are mentioned in <a href="../../par/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>, and from the invariable meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> itself. It is true that Irenaeus ('Contr. Haer.,' lib. 1.) applies this passage to the Valentinians and their succession of eons (Bythus, Nous, Logos, Anthropus, etc. - in all thirty, male and female); and so does Tertullian, who speaks of the seeds of the Gnostic heresies as already budding in St. Paul's days ('Advers Valentin.,' cap 3. and elsewhere), and Grotius supports thin explanation ('Comment.,' <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>). But it was very natural that Irenaeus and Tertullian, living when the heresies of Valentinus, Marcion, and others were at their height, should so accommodate St. Paul's words - which is all that Irenaeus does. On the other band, neither Irenaeus nor Tertullian shows that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was a word applied to the emanations of the eons in the Gnostic vocabulary. The genealogies, then, were Jewish pedigrees, either used <span class="accented">literally</span> to exalt individuals as being of priestly or Davidic origin (as the pedigrees of the Desposyni, or later of the princes of the Captivity), or used <span class="accented">cabbalistically</span>, so as to draw fanciful doctrines from the names composing a genealogy, or in some other way which we do not know of (see the writers 'Genealogies of Christ,' <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a>. &sect; 2:1; and note C at the end of the volume). <span class="accented">Endless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); found only here in the New Testament and so one of the words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles, but used in the LXX. for "infinite," "immeasurable." It means either "endless," "<span class="accented">interminable</span>," or, "having no useful end or purpose;" <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Chrysostom).

Taking the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, the phrase, "a dispensation of God which is in faith," must mean the gospel as delivered by revelation and received by faith. These fables and genealogies address themselves, the apostle says, to the disputatious, itching curiosity of men's minds, not to their faith. The substance of them is matter of doubtful disputation, not revealed truth. "<span class="accented">The</span> dispensation" <span class="accented">is</span> better English than "<span class="accented">a</span> dispensation." <span class="cmt_word">So do I now</span>; or, as the A.V., <span class="accented">so do</span>, is the conjectural filling up of the unfinished sentence which began "<span class="accented">as I</span> exhorted thee." But it is much more natural and simple to take ver. 18 as the apodosis, and the intermediate verses as a digression caused by St. Paul's desire to show how exactly the charge was in agreement with the true spirit of the Law of God.

Putting these together, it appears that sickness and bodily infirmity and death are, within certain limits, in the power of Satan to inflict.

In the case of Hymenaeus and Alexander (as in that of the incestuous person at Corinth), the punishment incident on this delivery to Satan would appear to have been short or' death, but in the case of the two first not to have had the effect of bringing them to a true repentance. <span class="cmt_word">Might be taught</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); viz. by correction and punishment, as children are taught (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-8</a>).
