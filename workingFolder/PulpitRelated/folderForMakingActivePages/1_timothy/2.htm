The question naturally arises whether the first words here used - <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - have any distinctive meaning, or are merely accumulated, like synonyms m legal documents, or various phrases in rhetorical addresses, to ensure completeness and to add force. It is against the notion of any distinctive meaning attaching to them that no such distinction can be supported by actual use. In <a href="../../par/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a> two of the words (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are used in conjunction as here with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, with no apparent difference, both being the way of making known their requests to God (so also <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a>). Again, in the ancient Liturgies, the words <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are constantly used of the same praying. It may, however, perhaps be said that every <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, though every <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is not a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a "petition" - a distinct asking something of God, which a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> need not necessarily be. It may be merely an act of adoration, of confession, of recital of God's mercies, and so on. So as regards <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, here rendered "intercessions." There is nothing in the etymology/ or in the use of this word, which only occurs elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>, to limit the meaning of it to "intercession." Nor has it this meaning in the passage where it occurs in the Liturgy of St. Clement, near the close, where God is addressed as <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "Who understandest the petitions even of those who are silent." In 2 Macc. 4:8 and Diod. Sic., 16:55 it seems to mean "a request preferred in a personal interview," which is an extension of its common meaning in classical Greek of "access," "an interview," "social intercourse," or the like. But when we turn to the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> in the New Testament, we seem to get the idea of "intercession."  <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is to go to someone to ask him to take action <span class="accented">against</span> or <span class="accented">in favor of</span> some third party (see <a href="../../par/acts/25-24.htm">Acts 25:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27, 28, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>); and so Chrysostom (quoted in Steph., 'Thesaur.') explains <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to be the action of one who applies to God to avenge him of those who have done him wrong. So that perhaps "intercessions" is, on the whole, the best rendering here, though an imperfect one; and would comprise the prayers for the emperor, for the Church, for the sick, travelers, slaves, captives, etc., for the bishops, clergy, and laity, etc., and such prayers as "Turn away from us every plot (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) of wicked men" (Liturgy of St. Mark).

"Every day, both in the evening and the morning, we offer prayers for the whole world, for kings, and for all in authority" (Chrysost., <span class="accented">in lee</span>.). So in the Liturgy of St. Mark: "Preserve our king in peace, in virtue, and righteousness.... Subdue his enemies under him... incline him to peace towards us and towards thy Holy Name, that in the serenity of his reign we too may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all piety and honesty [or, 'gravity']." In the Liturgy of St. Clement: "Let us pray for kings and those in authority, that they may be peaceably inclined toward us, and that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all piety and honesty [or, 'gravity']." In the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom: "Let us pray for our most religious and God-protected emperors, and all their palace and court." "We offer this our reasonable service on behalf of our most faithful and Christian (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) emperors, and all their palace and court." And in the Liturgy of St. Basil: "Remember, Lord, our most religious and faithful kings... that in their serenity we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.

The prayer for the rulers is recommended (as was explained in the above extracts from the Liturgies) in order to obtain for Christians a tranquil life, undisturbed by persecution and molestation, in spite of their peculiar way of life. Their wish was to be allowed to live in the faith and obedience of the gospel, "in godliness and gravity," without being interfered with by the heathen magistrates. The clause in the Prayer for the Church Militant which corresponds to this is "that under her we may be godly and quietly governed." <span class="accented">Tranquil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); found only here in the New Testament.

The transition from the personal <span class="accented">Eve</span> to the generic <span class="accented">woman</span> is further marked by the transition from the singular to the plural, "if they continue," etc. The natural and simple explanation of the passage is that the special temporal punishment pronounced against the woman, immediately after her sin, "In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children" (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>) - (to which St. Paul here evidently alludes) - and endured by all women ever since, was a set-off, so to speak, to the special guilt of Eve in yielding to the guile of the serpent; so that now the woman might attain salvation as well as the man (although she was not suffered to teach)if she continued in faith and charity. <span class="cmt_word">The child-bearing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); here only; but the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, which occurs in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>, is found (though very rarely) in classical Greek.
