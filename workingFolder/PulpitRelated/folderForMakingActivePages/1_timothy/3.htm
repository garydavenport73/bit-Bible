Possibly this application of the word arose from the visits of the apostles, and afterwards of men sent by the apostles, as Timothy and Titus, Tychicus and <span class="accented">Artemas</span>, were, to visit the Churches, being occasional and temporary only, as those of Visitors.

The metaphor is said (though denied by others)to be from wrestling or boxing, when a man leaves no part of his body exposed to the attack of his adversary. <span class="cmt_word">The husband of one wife</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>). Three senses are possible. The passage may be understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as <span class="accented">requiring</span> a bishop, (or presbyter) to have a wife, and so some took it even in Chrysostom's time (though he does not so understand it), and so the Russian Church understands it; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as prohibiting his having more than one with at a time; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as prohibiting second marriages for priests and bishops. Bishop Wordsworth, Bishop Ellicott, and Dean Alford, among English commentators, all agree in thinking that (3) is the apostle's meaning. In spite of such <span class="accented">consensus</span>, it appears in the highest degree improbable that St. Paul should have laid down such a condition for the priesthood. There is nothing in his writings when treating expressly of second marriages (<a href="../../par/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-8.htm">1 Corinthians 7:8, 39</a>) to suggest the notion of there being anything disreputable in a second marriage, and it would obviously cast a great slur upon second marriages if it were laid down as a principle that no one who had married twice was fit to be an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. But if we consider the general laxity in regard to marriage, and the facility of divorce, which prevailed among Jews and Romans at this time, it must have been a common thing for a man to have more than one woman living who had been his wife. And this, as a distinct breach of the primeval law (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), would properly be a bar to any one being called to the "office of a bishop." The same case is supposed in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10-13</a>. But it is utterly unsupported by any single passage in Scripture that a second marriage should disqualify a man for the sacred ministry. As regards the opinion of the early Church, it was not at all uniform, and amongst those who held that this passage absolutely prohibits second marriages in the case of an <span class="accented">episcopus</span>, it was merely a part of the asceticism of the day. As a matter of course, such writers as Origen and Tertullian held it. The very early opinion that Joseph, the husband of Mary, had children by a former wife, which finds place in the Protevangelium of James (9.), is hardly consistent with the theory of the disreputableness of second marriages. In like manner, the phrase in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-9.htm">1 Timothy 5:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, is best explained in accordance with the apostle's doctrine about the lawfulness of a woman's second marriage, as meaning that she was the husband of one man only, as long as her husband lived. (For the chief patristic opinions on the subject, see Bishop Wordsworth's note, and Bingham's 'Christian Antiquities,' bk. 4. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5.htm">1 Timothy 5</a>.)

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to be sober" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).

It must he remembered that the office of the early deacon was in a great measure secular, so that there is nothing strange in that of the deaconess being coupled with it. The retrain in ver. 12 to the male deacon is in favor of understanding "the women" of the deaconesses, as showing that the subject of the diaconate was not done with. Chrysostom (who says, "He is speaking of those who hold the rank of deaconesses") and all the ancient commentators, and De Wette, Wiesinger, Wordsworth, Alford, and Ellicott among the moderns, so understand it (see following notes). <span class="cmt_word">Grave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>; see ver. 8, note). <span class="cmt_word">Not slanderers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 8).

It does not follow that St. Paul had in his mind their advancement from the "<span class="accented">inferior</span> office" to "<span class="accented">the</span> higher ministries in the Church" (Ordination Service); he may merely have meant to say that the discharge of the duties of a deacon in an efficient and exemplary manner raised a man to high estimation in the Church, and so gave him confidence in confessing the faith of Jesus Christ both by word and deed. <span class="accented">Gain to themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); acquire by purchase or otherwise.

It is literally "to go up and down" a given place, "backwards and forwards," hence "to dwell in it." The substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, in the thirteen places where it occurs in the New Testament, is always rendered "conversation" in the A.V.; in the R.V., "manner of life," "life," "issue of life," "<span class="accented">manner</span> of living," "<span class="accented">behaviour</span>," "living." It is a favorite word in the two Epistles of St. Peter, where it occurs eight times. <span class="cmt_word">The house of God.</span> This phrase here denotes, as it is explained in the following words, the Church on earth. So <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>, "<span class="accented">Christ</span> as a Son over his house; whose house are we," where the reference is to <a href="../../par/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, "<span class="accented">My</span> servant Moses... is faithful in all mine house." <span class="cmt_word">The Church of the living God.</span> Here is again a somewhat remarkable resemblance to the phraseology of the Epistle to the Hebrews, "Ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God.... to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22, 23</a>). However, the phraseology is not peculiar to the Epistle to the Hebrews. Thus we read in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, "<span class="accented">Ye</span> are the temple of the living God." The phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> living <span class="accented">God</span>," occurs seven times in St. Paul's Epistles, and four times in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It occurs three times in the Gospels, once in the Acts of the Apostles, and once in the Revelation. Here it is used by St. Paul to enhance the obligation to a holy and blameless walk in those who have the oversight of his Church. <span class="cmt_word">The pillar and ground of the truth</span>. Some apply these words to Timothy himself (Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, and others cited by Alford), after the analogy of <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>, where James, Cephas, and John are said to be "pillars" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, where it is said of him that over-cometh, "I will make him a pillar (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the house of my God." And so, in Venantius Fortunatus, St. Paul is called "stilus ille." But the metaphors of "a pillar" and "a foundation" do not all suit the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; and it is well argued that the absence of the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is unfavorable to the application of "the pillar and ground of the truth" to the subject of the first clause. It is therefore better to understand this clause as descriptive of the Church of God. The Church is the pillar of the truth. It supports it; holds it together - binds together its different parts. And it is the ground of the truth. By it the truth is made fast, firm, and fixed. <span class="cmt_word">The ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). This word only occurs here at all; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, common both in the New Testament, the LXX., and in classical Greek, means "fixed," "firm," or" fast." In the A.V. of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a> and 1 Cor 15:58, "steadfast;" <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (where it is coupled with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), "settled."

The Vulgate has <span class="accented">quod</span>, agreeing with <span class="accented">sacramentum</span> and representing the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> Accepting this, then, as the true reading, we proceed to explain it. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;</span>, who, is a relative, and must, therefore, have an antecedent. But there is no expressed antecedent of the masculine gender for it to agree with. The antecedent, therefore, must be understood, and gathered from the preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. It can only be Christ. The mystery of the whole Old Testament, that which was wrapped in types and hidden under veils, was Christ (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). Moses spake of him, the Psalms speak of him, the prophets speak of him; but all of them spake darkly. But in the gospel "the mystery of Christ" (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>)is revealed. Christ is the Mystery of Christianity. It is, therefore, no difficult step to pass from "the mystery" to "Christ," and to supply the word "Christ" as the antecedent to "who." <span class="cmt_word">Was manifested</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); a word frequently applied to Christ (<a href="../../par/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>, etc.). The idea is the same in <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Justified in the spirit.</span> This is rather an obscure expression. But it seems to describe our Lord's spotless righteousness, perhaps with special reference to the declaration of it at his baptism, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." We have the same contrast between the flesh and the Spirit of Christ in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>. And between the flesh and the spirit of a Christian man in <a href="../../par/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, "The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." To this clause apparently the remark of Chrysostom applies, "God became man, and man became God." "The spirit" seems to mean the moral nature - the inner man. <span class="cmt_word">Seen of angels.</span> Perhaps the multitude of the heavenly host who welcomed the birth of Christ were permitted to see the new-born Babe, as he seems to have done who described him to the shepherds as "wrapped in swaddling clothes" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-12.htm">Luke 2:12-14</a>). Angels ministered unto him after the temptation (<a href="../../par/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>), and in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>, where the word <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is used), and at his resurrection (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). The special interest of angels in the "<span class="accented">great mystery"</span> is referred to in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Preached among the nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). It would have been better to keep the rendering "Gentiles" here, to mark the identity of thought with <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6, 8</a>, where, in the apostle's view, the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, that they might be fellow-heirs with the Jews of the promises of God, is one main feature of the mystery (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believed on in the world.</span> The next step in this ascending scale is the acceptance of Christ in the world as the Savior thereof. The language here is not stronger than that of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 6</a>, "The word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world, and beareth fruit." And in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, "The gospel which was preached in all creation under heaven" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). The statement in <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-20</a> might almost have been in St. Paul's mind. Note the use there of the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Received up in glory.</span> The change of "into" (A.V.) into "in" is of very doubtful propriety. In New Testament Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, frequently follows verbs of motion, and means the same as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. Our Lord is net said to have ascended <span class="accented">in glory</span> (as he appeared at the Transfiguration), but, as St. Mark has it, "He was received up into heaven, and [there] sat down at the right hand of God," fulfilling <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. This grand burst of dogmatic teaching is somewhat like that in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-7</a>. There is no adequate evidence of its being, as many commentators have thought, a portion of a hymn or creed used in the Church. It rather implies the same tension in the apostle's mind which is apparent in other parts of the Epistle (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a> and following verses). <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_timothy/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Timothy 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Timothy 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_timothy/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Timothy 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Timothy 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
