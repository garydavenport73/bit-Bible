The idea is "causing to wander," or "go astray." St. John warns his people against such deceiving spirits (<a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-6</a>).

But then the clause, "having their conscience seared with a hot iron," does not suit "devils." It is therefore, perhaps, best to translate the clause as the R.V. does, and to explain, with Bishop Ellicott, that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, which precedes <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, defines the <span class="accented">instrument</span> by which they were led to give heed to seducing spirits, viz. the hypocritical preterites of the men who spake lies, and whose consciences were seared.

The application of the image is somewhat uncertain. If the idea is that of "a brand," a mark burnt in upon the forehead of a slave or criminal, then the meaning is that these men have their own infamy stamped upon their own consciences. It is not patent only to others, but to themselves also. But if the metaphor is from the cauterizing a wound, as the A.V. takes it, then the idea is that these men's consciences are become as insensible to the touch as the skin that has been cauterized is. The metaphor, in this case, is somewhat similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, etc.). The latter interpretation seems to suit the general context best, and the medical use of the term, which St. Paul might have learnt from Luke. The emphasis of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "their own conscience," implies that they were not merely deceivers of others, but were self-deceived.

His meal consisted of a piece of bread, and a single mess of vegetables" ('Introd.,' p. 86). Professor Burton (in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art.

But here, where <span class="accented">the act of teaching</span> (like the <span class="accented">act of reading</span>, the <span class="accented">act of exhorting</span>, in the two preceding clauses) is intended, "teaching" is perhaps the best word according to our modern usage. As regards the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the former would express "<span class="accented">doctrinal</span> teaching," whether of dogma or of precept, the latter entreaties to believe the one and practice the other (see <a href="../../par/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a> and Acts 14:22 for good examples of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gift</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "<span class="accented">to</span> give anything freely," gratuitously, of mere good will, without any payment or return (<a href="../../par/luke/7-42.htm">Luke 7:42</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, etc.). Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> came to be especially applied to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are preeminently "free gifts" (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20</a>). It is so applied in <a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4, 9, 28, 30, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>. Here, then, as in the similar passage, <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, the "<span class="accented">gift"</span> spoken of is the special grace given by the Holy Ghost to those who are separated for "<span class="accented">the</span> office and work of a priest in the Church of God by the imposition of hands" (Ordering of Priests). This gift St. Paul bids him <span class="cmt_word">not neglect</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The word contains the idea of contemptuous neglect - neglect as of an unimportant thing. In <a href="../../par/matthew/22-5.htm">Matthew 22:5</a> the persons invited to the feast made light of it, and went away to other things which they cared mere about. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and Hebrews 8:9, imply a contemptuous disregard. So here Timothy is reminded that in his ordination he received a great <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that he must value it duly, and use it diligently. It must not be let lie slumbering and smoldering, but must be stirred up into a flame. The lesson here and in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a> seems to be that we must look back to our ordination, and to the spiritual grace given in it, as things not exhausted. The grace is there, but it must not be lightly thought cf. <span class="cmt_word">Which was given thee by prophecy.</span> This seems to be explained by <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>, where Barnabas and Saul were separated for their work by the laying on of the hands apparently of the prophets and teachers, at the express command of the Holy Ghost, speaking doubtless by the mouth of one of the prophets. Timothy, it appears, was designated for his work by a like command of the Holy Ghost, speaking by one of the Church prophets, and received his commission by a like "<span class="accented">laying</span> on of hands" by the elders of the Church. If St. Paul refers, as he appears to do, to the same occasion in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, then it appears that he laid his hands on Timothy, together with the presbyters, as is done by the bishop in the ordination of priests. <span class="cmt_word">The presbytery</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The word is borrowed from the Jewish nomenclature (see <a href="../../par/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>; <span class="accented">Acts</span> 22:5). In a slightly different sense for "the office of a presbyter," Sus., 5:50 (Cod. Alex.).

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, besides this passage, occurs in its classical sense of "premeditating" or "getting up a speech," in <a href="../../par/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a> (where, however, the reading is doubtful), and again in <a href="../../par/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>, in the sense of "premeditating" certain actions. A kindred use in classical Greek is "to practice" or "exercise" an art, as rhetoric, dancing, shooting with a bow, and the like. It is very common in the LXX., in the sense of "meditating," practicing in the thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">Give thyself wholly to them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">be in these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be wholly and always occupied with them.
