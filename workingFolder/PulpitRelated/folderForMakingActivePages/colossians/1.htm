The apostle designates himself by his <span class="accented">office</span>, as always, except in the Macedonian Epistles and the letter of private friendship to Philemon. Timothy shares also in the greeting of the Epistle to Philemon, probably a leading member of the Colossian Church (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-9.htm">Colossians 4:9, 17</a> with <a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2, 10-12</a>). During St. Paul's long residence at Ephesus Timothy was with him (<a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>), and there, probably, Philemon had come under his influence (see Introduction, &sect; 2), and made Timothy's acquaintance. There was, therefore, at least one link of acquaintance between "Timothy the brother" and "the saints in Colossae" (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; 1 and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>, where his name appears in the same way).

The omission is well established (see Revised Text, and critical editors generally), and cannot surely be accidental. In this and the twin Ephesian letter, devoted as they are to the glory of Christ, the name of <span class="accented">the Father</span> stands out with a peculiar prominence and dignity, much as in St. John's Gospel: "honouring the Son," they must needs "honour the Father" also (vers. 12, 13; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>).

The Revised Text omits "and" between" God" and "Father," following Lachmann, Westcott and Heft, and Lightfoot (who hesitates), on evidence numerically slight, but sufficient; especially as in every other instance of this combination the conjunction is present. "Father" is also without definite article in the better attested (Revised) reading. The words, "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," bear, therefore, an explanatory, quasi-predicative force. St. Paul wishes his readers to understand that he gives thanks to God on their account distinctly under this aspect, regarded as <span class="accented">"Father</span> of Christ." He has just spoken <span class="accented">of "our</span> Father," and now adds, "Father of our Lord Jesus <span class="accented">Christ,"</span> suggesting that it is in this relation that we know God as <span class="accented">"our</span> Father," the Author of grace and peace, the Object of Christian thanksgiving. So the sovereign and exclusive mediation of Christ, the ruling idea of the whole Epistle, is thrown into bold relief at the outset; and, in this light, the unique omissions of vers. 2 and 3 explain and justify each other. This fatherhood embraces the entire Person and offices of the Son as "our Lord Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Praying always for you</span> (ver. 9; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>). The apostle had known from the first of the existence of this Church; and had already been in communication with it (see Introduction, &sect; 2). He had, therefore, a general prayerful interest in the Colossians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>), that has been quickened to joyful thanksgiving (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6-10</a>) by the arrival of Epaphras. "Always" and <span class="accented">"for</span> you" - either or both of the phrases  - may be joined grammatically to <span class="accented">"we</span> give thanks" or to "praying:" the latter connection is preferable (see Alford or Ellicott); similarly in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-4.htm">Philemon 1:4</a>; in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a> the turn of expression is different.

In the Epistles of this period the Christian state appears chiefly as "life in Christ;" rather than, as in the earlier letters, as "salvation through Christ" (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>. and <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). The "love" of the Colossians evokes thanksgiving, as that which they have "toward all the saints;" for as the Church extended Christian love needed to be more catholic (ver. 6; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), and Colossian error in particular tended to exclusiveness and caste feeling (see note on ver. 28). The iteration of "all" in this Epistle is remarkable.

St. Paul speaks most of <span class="accented">heaven</span> and <span class="accented">heavenly things</span> in the letters of this period. Ver. 4 gives the nearest grammatical connection for this clause; and many recent commentators, following Greek interpreters, accordingly find here that which "evokes and conditions" the Colossians' "love" (Meyer, Ellicott) or "faith and love" (De Wette, Lightfoot). But this construction we reject. For it makes the heavenly reward the reason of the Colossians' present (faith and) love, reversing the true and Pauline order of thought (<a href="../../par/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17, 18</a>); while, on the other hand, the heavenly hope is the last and highest ground of the apostle's thanksgivings and encouragements, and the forfeiture or impairing of it the chief matter of his fears and warnings throughout the Epistles of this group (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 22, 23, 27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11-21</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>). It is better, therefore, with Bengel, Hofmann, Klopper, Conybeare, Eadie, and others, from Athanasius downwards, to refer ver. 5 as well as ver. 4 to the principal verb, "we give thanks" (ver. 3). What the apostle hears of "the faith and love" of the Colossian brethren moves him to give thanks for "the hope which is in store for them in heaven." Of that hope this faith and love are to him a pledge and an earnest, even as the "seal of the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>) and the "peace of Christ in their hearts" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; see note) are to themselves. Similarly, in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a> and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4, 5</a>, from the present faith and patience of the saints the certainty of their future blessedness is argued. By singling out this <span class="accented">hope</span> as chief matter of thanksgiving here, the apostle enhances its certainty and its value in his readers' eyes. (On this verse, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 74-80.) From the <span class="accented">general occasion and ground</span> of his thanksgiving in the Christian state and prospects of his readers, St. Paul proceeds to dwell on certain <span class="accented">special circumstances</span> which enhanced his gratitude to God (vers. 56-8). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (hope) <span class="cmt_word">ye heard of before, in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span> or, <span class="accented">good tidings</span> (vers. 7, 23; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). There is a veiled polemic reference in "the word of <span class="accented">the truth</span> of the gospel" (comp. ver. 7 and parallels from Galatians). The word "before" (<span class="accented">aforetime</span>) "contrasts their earlier with their later lessons, the true gospel of Epaphras with the false gospel of recent teachers" (Lightfoot). Others interpret, less suitably: <span class="accented">heard already</span> (<span class="accented">before my writing</span>), or <span class="accented">heard beforehand</span> (<span class="accented">before the fulfilment of the hope</span>). It is in St. Paul's manner to refer his readers at the outset to their conversion and first Christian experiences (see parallel passages). Their <span class="accented">hope</span> was directly at stake in the controversy with Colossian error. Here we meet the first of those cumulative combinations of nouns, so marked a feature of the style of Colossians and Ephesians, which are made a reproach against these Epistles by some critics; but each is appropriate in its place.

The words, "and increasing," are added to the text on the testimony, all but unanimous, of the older witnesses. Their propriety is manifest; for the success of the gospel at Colossae was a gratifying evidence, both of its inherent fruitfulness, and of its rapid progress in the Gentile world. Stationary at Rome (see Introduction, &sect; 3), and with his messengers coming and going, and news reaching him from time to time of the advance of the Christian cause, the strong expression, "in all the world," is natural to St. Paul.

For their progress had been continuous (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>).

Only in <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> does the epithet "fellow-bondman" appear again in St. Paul (the Revisers in these two places omit their marginal "bondservant"). The dominant thought of Christ Jesus "the Lord" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-4:1</a>) possibly dictates this expression. That the Colossians had received the gospel in this way from Epaphras, a disciple of St. Paul, was a striking proof of its fruitfulness, and a further cause for thanksgiving on his own part. <span class="cmt_word">Who is a faithful minister of Christ on our (or, <span class="accented">your</span>) behalf</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-22.htm">2 Corinthians 8:22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). He puts his seal upon the ministry of Epaphras, and vindicates it against all questioning at home. Textual evidence for "on our" or "your behalf" is pretty evenly balanced: most older Greek copies read the first person, while the ancient versions generally adopted the second; and the critical editors are similarly divided. The Revisers, with Tregelles, Alford, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, prefer "our," which gives a finer and more fitting sense. It was as St. Paul's representative that Epaphras had ministered in Colossae, and to him he now reported his success; and this justified the apostle in claiming the Colossians as his own charge, and in writing to them in the terms of this letter (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1, 2, 5-7</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13-16</a>).

Epaphras had conveyed the blessings of the gospel from St. Paul to the Colossians, and they now send back the grateful assurance of their love by the same channel (comp, note on "having heard," ver. 4, and parallel passages). This was a choice fruit of the gospel in them (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10, 15-18</a>), and such a reference to it gives a kindly conclusion to the thanksgiving. Ellicott and others understand here <span class="accented">brotherly love in general</span> - a somewhat pointless repetition of ver. 4.

The <span class="accented">Spirit</span> is the ruling element of the Colossians' love (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) Love-in-the-Sprat forms a single compound phrase, like "faith-in-Christ-Jesus" (ver. 4). The one <span class="accented">Spirit</span> dwells alike in all the members of Christ's body, however sundered by place or circumstance (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-4</a>), and makes them one in love to each other as to him (<a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23, 24</a>). "Spirit" occurs besides in this Epistle only in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a> (but see "spiritual," ver. 9), and some find in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1, 5</a> the explanation of this phrase (<span class="accented">sc.</span> "a love formed in absence, without personal intercourse:" but this is forced, and doubtful in point of grammar). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - The <span class="accented">opening prayer</span> rises out of the foregoing thanksgiving, and leads up to the chief doctrinal statement of the Epistle (vers. 15-20: compare, for the connection, <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8-17</a>).

The "redemption of the body" (also <span class="accented">bought</span> by the same <span class="accented">price</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>) will make the work complete (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). Lightfoot suggests that the apostle intends to contradict the doctrine of redemption taught by the Gnostics, who made it consist in initiation into their "mysteries" (see note on ver. 27); and supposes that this notion may already have existed at Colossae in some incipient form. But such an abuse of the term seems to imply a well established and familiar Christian use. Philo, who speaks the language of the Jewish philosophic mysticism of the first century, has no such usage. In firm, clear lines the apostle has retraced, in vers. 12-14 (comp. vers. 20-23; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-14</a>), the teaching of his earlier Epistles on the doctrines of salvation. Here he assumes, in brief and comprehensive terms, what in writing to the Galatians and Romans he had formerly been at so much pains to prove.

The Pauline doctrine of the Church as the body of Christ is developed in Colossians and Ephesians, especially in the later Epistle, where it receives its fruitful application. Here the doctrine of the Person of Christ and the doctrine of the Church find their meeting-point as mutually implying each other, and together opposed to the double effect of early Gnosticism, which tended first to lower the dignity of Christ, and then to impair the unity of his Church (see <a href="../../par/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, note). In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4, 5</a> the figure of the <span class="accented">body and members</span> is merely a passing illustration of the mutual relation of believers in the Church; now <span class="accented">the body of Christ</span> becomes the formal title of the Church, expressing the fundamental and fixed conception of its nature as related to him, who is the centre of its unity, the source of all vital energy and directing control within it (comp. the <span class="accented">vine and branches</span>, <a href="../../par/john/15.htm">John 15</a>.). In vers. 16, 17 the writer passed from the thought of the origin to that of the constitution of the cosmos; now he proceeds in the reverse order.

As explained by the following words, it denotes, as in philosophical Greek, a <span class="accented">first principle, originating cause, fens et origo</span> (see Lightfoot's note and references). To borrow "of the dead" from the following parallel clause weakens the force of both. His body, the Church, <span class="accented">begins</span> in him, dating and deriving from him its "all in all" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This is quite consistent with the "all things are of God" of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; for the apostle is thinking here of the relative, historical beginning of <span class="accented">"the</span> kingdom of the Son" (ver. 13), there of the absolute beginning of the Divine work of redemption (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; and note on "unto him," ver. 16).

The apostle derives the whole life and power of Christianity, whether as seen in Christ or proved by his people, from his resurrection (see parallels). The name <span class="accented">Firstborn</span> brings over with it into this verse the glory which surrounds it in ver. 15. The Divine Firstborn, who is before and over all things, wins his title a second time for his earthly brethren's sake (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10-15</a>).

The combination of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("being") with perfect passive participle ("having been alienated") implies a fixed condition, that has become as a part of one's nature (so in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, Revised Text). As the opposite of "reconciled," "alienated" is strictly passive, and denotes, not a subjective feeling on the part of the sinner, but an objective determination on the part of God, an exclusion from the Divine favour, from "the kingdom of the Son" and "the lot of the saints" (vers. 12, 13; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3, 11-13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>: comp. usage of LXX in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9; 1</a> Esdr. 9:4; Sir. 11:34). "Enemies in your thought" sets forth the disposition of the sinner towards God (<a href="../../par/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18</a>: so Alford,Ellicott, Lightfoot). Meyer maintains the passive sense of "enemies," as found in <a href="../../par/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>. On the latter view, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> is instrumental dative, "by," "in virtue of your state of mind;" on the former, it is dative of reference or definition. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (here only and <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a> and Ephesians 4:18 in St. Paul) has possibly a polemical reference. It denotes in Greek philosophy, the faculty of <span class="accented">thought</span>, as opposed to the bodily powers. In Philo's teaching it signifies the higher part of human nature, akin to God, and opposed to evil which belongs to the senses: "Thought (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the best thing in us" ('On Fugitives,' &sect; 26); "Every man in regard to his intellect (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is united to the Divine Word, being an impression or fragment or ray of that blessed nature; but in respect of his body he belongs to the entire world" ('On the Creation of the World,' &sect; 51). But here sin is associated With <span class="accented">the intellect in</span> man, and redemption with "the body of Christ's flesh" (ver. 22): comp. notes on "reason," <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>, and "body," <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; also <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, where <span class="accented">the reason</span> is vain, <span class="accented">the intellect</span> darkened. "Wicked [emphasized by its position in the Greek, denoting <span class="accented">active</span> evil; see Trench's 'Synonyms,' on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>] works" is a phrase common in St. John, only used here by St. Paul (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). These <span class="accented">works</span> are the practices of life in which the sinner is abidingly excluded from "the kingdom of Christ and God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>), and manifests the radical antipathy of his mind toward God. "Yet [or, 'but'] now:" comp. ver. 26; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, etc. - a lively form of transition characteristic of St. Paul, primarily temporal, then also logical in sense. "Were ye reconciled" breaks through the grammatical structure of the sentence, as in vers. 26, 27 (see Lightfoot, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 717). If "did he reconcile" (or, "hath he reconciled") be the correct reading, "Christ" is still subject of the verb, as in vers. 19-22, and consistently with <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>. (On "reconcile," see ver. 20.)

With a significant emphasis, the material body of Christ is made the instrument of that reconciliation in the carrying out of which "his whole fulness" is engaged (vers. 19, 20); see note on "thought," ver. 21, and on "body," <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. The necessity of the double expression was shown by the fact that the Gnostic Marcion erased "of his flesh" from the text of this Epistle, and interpreted "the body" as "the Church;" Bengel and others suppose "of his flesh "to be added to prevent this mistake (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:19). This phrase was the crux of Docetism, whose principles were indeed implicitly contained in the Alexandrine-Jewish philosophy with its contempt for matter and the physical life, which was now first beginning to leaven the Church. <span class="accented">Body</span> is antithetical to <span class="accented">soul: flesh</span> to <span class="accented">spirit.</span> The former is individual and concrete, the actual physical organism; the latter denotes the material of which it consists, the bodily nature in its essence and characteristics (comp. note on ver. 11; and see Cremer's 'Lexicon' on these words). "In the body" is not "by the body," nor "during his earthly life" (as though opposed to "out of the body," <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-3.htm">2 Corinthians 12:3</a>), but "as incarnate."

So, in general, Meyer and Alford. Ellicott and Lightfoot refer to <span class="accented">God's present approbations</span>, quoting <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, a parallel much less close than ver. 27, and supposing "God" the subject of the verb (see note on ver. 19). "Holy erga Deum; <span class="accented">without blemish</span> respectu vestri; <span class="accented">unreprovable</span> respectu proximi" (Bengel). (On "holy," see note, ver. 2; also <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>.)

In the LXX it is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">tamim</span> ("integer"), "faultless" in bodily condition or in moral character.

As present indicative, it implies a (supposed) actual state. "The faith," as regularly in the New Testament, is the act and exercise of faith (subjective), not the content or matter of faith (objective). "Grounded" or "founded," perfect passive, implies a fixed condition (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>, coupled with "rooted;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; also <a href="../../par/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>).

(<span class="accented">The gospel</span>) which you heard (vers. 5, 7: notes), which was preached in all creation that is under the heaven (ver. 6; <a href="../../par/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>). The transition from "you" to "all creation" resembles that of vers. 5, 6 (comp. vers. 20, 21). "Preached" is literally" heralded," "loudly and officially announced;" so, frequently in St. Paul (see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>), also in <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. Greek usage does not support the interpretation which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("creation ") equivalent to "humanity." This sense of the word, which, even in Mark, such interpreters as Bengel, Lange, Alford, reject, is quite Hebraistic and exceptional. The phrase, "all creation," the writer has already used in ver. 15; here, as there (see here), without the article (Revised Text). The universal meaning it carries there is now limited by "under the heaven." The <span class="accented">earthly creation</span> subject as it is to Christ, is the sphere of this proclamation, the <span class="accented">preaching room</span> which is to resound everywhere with the glad tidings (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>). And with this range it <span class="accented">was proclaimed</span>, for from the first it claimed universal audience. Whereof I became, I Paul, a minister (vers. 24-29; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15-19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1, 2, 16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1-10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16-18</a>). (For "minister," see ver. 7.) The later Epistles betray a markedly heightened sense in the apostle of the unique dignity and importance of his own position, and those who question their authenticity press this fact against them. But the difference of tone is what one would expect in "such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>). As the Gentile Churches grew, reverence for his person deepened; and the success of his life mission became more assured, especially now that the struggle with reactionary Judaism, signalized by the Epistles of the third missionary journey, was to a large extent decided in his favour. The false teachers he is now opposing did not, we should gather, attack the apostle personally; but may rather have claimed to be on his side. The movement of thought we have followed in vers. 15-23 proceeds from <span class="accented">Christ's redeeming work</span> to <span class="accented">the experience of the Colossians</span> in receiving it, and <span class="accented">the labours of the apostle</span> in publishing it; and is parallel to that of <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-3:13</a>.

Christ, the Head, had borne his part, now the apostle in turn fills up his part, in the great sum of suffering to be undergone on behalf of the body of Christ (see parallels). The verb being so understood, then, with Lightfoot, we infer that "the afflictions of Christ" (a phrase peculiar. . to this passage). are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Christ's own ministerial sufferings</span>, endured at the hands of men. <span class="accented">Affliction</span> is a common term for all that Christians suffer as being in "this present evil world" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4-6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).

It is worthy of note that, unless it be in the Epistle to the Hebrews, St. Paul never uses the words "suffer," "suffering" (much less "affliction") in connection with the atoning sacrifice. He dwells rather on the objective fact itself - "the death," "the cross," "the blood." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The prevailing interpretation (Chrysostom, Augustine, down to Alford, Ellicott) finds here <span class="accented">the afflictions of the Church</span> (including Paul's) <span class="accented">made Christ's by mystic sympathy</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23, 29</a>). But this view identifies Paul's sufferings with his Master's, while he expressly distinguishes them; and the idea, however beautiful in itself, is without Pauline analogy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Meyer holds the afflictions to be <span class="accented">Paul's own afflictions which are Christ's by ethical identity, as</span> belonging to the same class.

Dr. Gloag, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 7. pp. 224-236, fully discusses the passage and ably defends (3). <span class="cmt_word">In my flesh</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>); for St. Paul's physical nature felt keenly the pangs of imprisonment, the chafing of "these bonds." And thus he puts honour on the despised <span class="accented">flesh</span>, as capable of such high service (see note, ver. 22)<span class="cmt_word">. On behalf of his body, which is the Church</span> (ver. 18; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). The interests of the Church demanded his sufferings. They are "for you" (Colossian Gentiles); but, in his view, the full possession of the gospel by the Gentiles and the existence of the Church itself were vitally bound up together (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). If "Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for her" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>), he might well in his turn suffer on the same account. The magnitude of the interests involved are measured by his greatness whose body the Church is (vers. 15-18). (On "body," see note, ver. 18 .)

In this office he "administers the gospel" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17, 18</a>), "the grace of God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>), and here more especially "the mystery" of vers. 26, 27 (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, R.V.).

Some interpreters connect "to you-ward" with the word "fulfil," but less suitably (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To fulfil the word of God</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16-19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>). "To fulfil" (see vers. 9, 24, and "fulness," ver. 19; also <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>) is either "to complete," to give full development and extension to the gospel message (vers. 5, 6; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 21, 27</a>); or "to accomplish" the prophetic word (<a href="../../par/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24-26</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8 - 12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15-17</a>), as in <a href="../../par/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>, and frequently in the Gospels.

The word "mystery" plays a large part in Colossians and Ephesians. It occurs in 1 Corinthians, and twice in the Roman Epistle, written from Corinth. Its use in <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a> is identical with that of the passage before us. The Greek <span class="accented">mysteries</span> were secret religious doctrines and rites made known only to initiated persons, who formed associations statedly assembling at certain sacred spots, of which Eleusis near Athens was the most famous. These systems exercised a vast influence over the Greek mind, and Greek literature is full of allusions to them; but their secret has been well kept, and little is known of their real character. Some of these mystic systems, probably, inculcated doctrines of a purer and more spiritual type than those of the vulgar polytheism. The ascetic and mystical doctrines ascribed to Pythagoras were propagated by secret societies. The language and ideas connected with the mysteries were readily adopted by the Jewish Broad Church of Alexandria, whose endeavour it was to expand Judaism by a symbolical and allegorizing method into a philosophic and universal religious system, and who were compelled to veil their inner doctrine from the eyes of their stricter, unenlightened (or unsophisticated) fellowbelievers. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> appears in the Apocrypha as an epithet of the Divine Wisdom (Wisd. 2:22 Wisd. 8:4; etc.): <a href="../../par/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>) furnished the Old Testament basis of this usage. (See Philo, 'On the Cherubim,' &sect; 12; 'On Fugitives,' &sect; 16; etc., for the place <span class="accented">of mystery</span> in the Alexandrine theology.) St. Paul, writing to men accustomed, either as Greeks or as Hellenistic Jews, to this phraseology, calls the gospel <span class="accented">"a</span> mystery," as that which <span class="accented">is "hidden</span> from the natural understanding and from the previous searchings of men" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>). But in the words that follow he repudiates the notion of any secrecy or exclusiveness in its proclamation (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12-4:6</a>); in his language, "mystery is the correlate of revelation." The thrice-repeated <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> ("from," "away"), with the double indication of time, "gives a solemn emphasis" (Meyer) to the statement. <span class="accented">Ages</span> are successive epochs of time, with their states and conditions (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>); <span class="accented">generations</span> are successive races of men, with their traditions and hereditary tendencies. But now it was made manifest to his saints (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). The word "reveal" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) indicates a process, "make manifest" points to the result of this Divine act (<a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> with Romans 3:21; see Trench's 'Synonyms'). The transition from the participle in the last clause to the strongly assertive finite verb in this almost disappears in English idiom: comp. vers. 5, 6; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a> (Greek); and see Winer's 'N.T. Grammar,' p. 717, or A. Buttmann, p. 382. There is also a change of tense: the manifestation is a single, sudden event (aorist), breaking through the long and seemingly final concealment of all previous time (present perfect participle); similarly in <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, note). <span class="accented">To his sailors</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Church at large (ver. 2; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>); but this implies a spiritual qualification (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). "His saints" are the recipients; "his <span class="accented">holy</span> apostles and prophets, in the Spirit," the organs (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>) of this manifestation. The Church had long ago formally accepted this revelation (<a href="../../par/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>); it was St. Paul's office to make it practically effectual. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a></div><div class="verse">To whom God would make known what <i>is</i> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the Gentiles</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5-10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11, 12, 25-32</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9-12</a>). "Willed" stands emphatically first in the Greek. The revelation was so momentous in its issue, so signal in its method, and so contrary to human foresight and prejudice, that it proceeded evidently from" the will of God" (vers. 1, 9; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18</a>): "Who was I," said St. Peter, "that I could withstand God?" The Ephesian letter delights to dwell on <span class="accented">God's will</span> as the cause of the whole counsel and work of salvation. The Revisers have rendered the verb by "was pleased," the equivalent of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> (ver. 19; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 9</a>; etc.). There is no need to seek a reference to <span class="accented">free grace</span> in the verb "willed;" the two ideas are concurrent, but distinct (see, however, Lightfoot). The apostle's mind is filled with amazement as he contemplates the boundless <span class="accented">riches</span> which the salvation of the Gentiles revealed in God himself (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8-10</a>). "The glory of this mystery" is the splendour with which it invests the Divine character (on "glory," see note, ver. 11; and for "riches of glory," <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>). <span class="accented">Amongst the Gentiles:</span> "semi-local clause, defining the sphere in which the riches of the glory is more specially evinced" (Ellicott).

By a bold metonymy, the <span class="accented">mystery</span> is identified with its subject or content. It is "Christ" himself (see <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>, note), the Divine secret of the ages, the burden of all revelation; and "Christ in you" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), Christ dwelling in Gentile carts - this is the wonder of wonders! So the "sinners of the Gentiles" receive "the like [equal] gift" with the heirs of the promises (<a href="../../par/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>).

"Admonishing and teaching" are the two essential parts of the apostle's ministry, related as repentance to faith (Lightfoot, who gives interesting classical parallels). <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> (radically, "to put in mind"), peculiar to St. Paul in New Testament (including <a href="../../par/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>), may denote reproof for the past, but more especially warning for the future (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>: comp. note on Colossians 3:16). Thrice in this verse "every man" is repeated, and "in all wisdom" follows "teaching" with a marked emphasis. The Colossian errorists, as we should presume from the general tenor and affinities of their system, sought to form an inner mystical school or circle of discipleship within the Church, initiated into a wisdom and holiness supposed to be higher than that attainable by ordinary Christian faith (see note on "mystery," ver. 26; also <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3, 8</a>). <span class="accented">An intellectual caste-feeling</span> (see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>) was springing up in the Church. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a> the apostle denounces the pride of reason which claims "the things of God" as its own; here he denounces the pride of intellect which refuses the knowledge of them to those who stand on a lower level of mental culture. To <span class="accented">every man</span> the Divine wisdom in Christ is accessible (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18, 19</a>): to none but "the spiritual man" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 12-3:1</a>). "Wisdom" here is not subjective, a quality of the apostle (so Meyer, quoting <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>), but objective, the quality of the truth itself (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22-25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we may present every man perfect in Christ</span> (ver. 22; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-7.htm">2 Corinthians 13:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>): the aim alike of Christ's redemption (ver. 22) and of the apostle's ministry. "Perfect" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is a word associated with the Greek mysteries (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>; and quotations in Lightfoot), and in common use denoted "full-grown," "grown men," as opposed to" children "(<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:1</a>). The philosophic Judaists affected this term considerably. Philo frequently distinguishes between the "perfect" or "fully initiated" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), who are admitted to the sight of God, and the "advancing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>), who are candidates for admission to the Divine mysteries; and he makes Jacob a type of the latter, Israel of the former (see 'On Drunkenness,' &sect; 20; 'On Change of Names,' &sect; 3; 'On Agriculture,' &sect;&sect; 36-38). The apostle makes "perfect" designedly parallel to the "holy and without blemish" of ver. 22, holding out a spiritual ideal very different from that of Alexandrine mystics; and declares that it is to be realized "in Christ" (vers. 2, 4), as in ver. 22 it appeared to be wrought "through Christ" and "for Christ" (comp. ver. 16).

The figurative use of "striving" ("agonizing," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "contending in the arena") is only Pauline in the New Testament: comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>; also <a href="../../par/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>; in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a> (R.V.) it is again connected with "toil" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>). We need not, with Meyer and Ellicott, distinguish inward from outward <span class="accented">striving</span> in this word. The apostle's bodily sufferings (ver. 21) and his mental anxiety (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>) alike enter into the mighty struggle which he is maintaining on the Church's behalf, and which strains every fibre of his nature to the utmost (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>). "Striving" implies opponents against whom he contends (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>); "toiling hard," the painful efforts he has to make. In this toll he is divinely sustained, for he "strives according to his [Christ's: comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>] working." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("energy," "operative force," "power in action") - another word of St. Paul's vocabulary (frequent also in Aristotle) - is used by him only of supernatural power, "a working of God," "of Satan" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which worketh in me with power</span> (ver. 11; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>). The "energy of Christ" is such that it "effectually works" in the apostle; the same idea is repeated in noun and verb (ver. 11, note). The verb is middle in voice, as this "working" is that in which the Divine "energy of Christ" puts itself forth and shows what it can do (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3-6</a>); see note on "bearing fruit," ver. 6, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 318 (dynamic middle). So it works unmistakably "in [or, 'with'] power." Never do we find this consciousness of the Divine power dwelling in himself expressed by St. Paul with such joyous confidence as at this period (see <a href="../../par/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9, 20</a>; and comp. note on ver. 23 b). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../philippians/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Philippians 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Philippians 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../colossians/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Colossians 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Colossians 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
