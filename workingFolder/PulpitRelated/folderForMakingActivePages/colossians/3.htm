THE TRUE CHRISTIAN LIFE. The apostle, having delivered his attack on the system of error inculcated at Colossae, now passes from the controversial to the more practical purport of his letter. There is no break, however, in the current of his thought; for throughout this chapter he urges the pursuit of a practical Christian life in a sense and in a manner silently opposed to the tendencies of Gnosticizing error. How much more congenial was the task to which he now addresses himself we may judge, perhaps, from the ease and simplicity which mark the language of this chapter, as compared with the abrupt and seemingly embarrassed style of the last section. We may analyze the hortatory section of the Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4:6</a>) as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>, urging the Colossians to maintain <span class="accented">a lofty spiritual life</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> vers. 5-8, <span class="accented">to put off</span> their old vices, <span class="accented">impurity, malice, falsehood</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> vers. 9-14, <span class="accented">to put on</span> the new Christian virtues, especially <span class="accented">gentleness, forgivingness, love</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> vers. 15-17, to let <span class="accented">the sovereign influence of Christ</span> sway their whole life - inward, social, secular; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> ver. 18 - <a href="../../par/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>, enjoining the Christian discharge of their relative duties, as <span class="accented">wives and husbands, children and fathers, servants and masters</span>, under the sense of their allegiance to <span class="accented">the Lord Christ</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> <a href="../../par/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2-4</a>, exhorting to <span class="accented">constant prayer</span>, and especially for the apostle himself at the present juncture; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(g)</span> vers. 5, 6, to wise conduct and edifying speech <span class="accented">toward them that are without.</span> It will be seen how much more comprehensive and systematic is the view thus presented of Christian duty than that furnished by earlier Epistles; and how the ideas of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">supremacy of Christ, the unity of the Christian brotherhood</span>, and <span class="accented">the sacredness of the natural constitution of human life</span>, which were threatened by the rise of Gnosticism in Colossae, underlie the apostle's exposition of Christian ethics. Paragraphs (a) to (d) in the above analysis we have grouped together under the title given to this section; (e) demands a separate treatment; and (f) and (g) will finally be bracketed together. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If, therefore, ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at God's right hand; mind the things above, not the things upon the earth</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-13.htm">Luke 12:13-40</a>). The apostle has already shown that when his readers, entering the gate of baptism, became Christians through faith in Christ, they <span class="accented">died with him</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>), <span class="accented">were buried</span>, then <span class="accented">raised and made alive together with him</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>): comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>. So they were restored to peace and favour with God (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13, 14</a>), severed from their old life of sin (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), and set in the path of holiness (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>). At the same time, they left behind all childish, tentative forms and notions ("rudiments") of religion, whether Jewish or non-Jewish (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 11, 18, 20-23</a>). They became dead both from sin and from human modes of salvation. Both are included in "the things upon the earth," to which belong at once the grosser sensual forms of sin (ver. 5) with its "surfeiting of the flesh" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>), and that vaunted <span class="accented">philosophy</span>, which is after all earth born and earthward tending (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 20</a>), bringing the soul again into bondage to material things. The apostle lifts his readers into a new, heavenly sphere. He bids them make "the things above," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the things of Christ," the one object of their thought and endeavour. So they will master the flesh <span class="accented">by rising above it</span>, instead of fighting it on its own ground by ceremonial rite and ascetic regimen. "The things above" are no abstract, transcendental conception, as in the theology of St. Paul's opponents, for they are "where Christ is." The things "in the heavens" as well as those "upon the earth" were created "in him, through him, unto him" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>); <span class="accented">there</span> he is Lord, even as <span class="accented">here</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). His presence gives distinctness and positiveness to the Christian's view of heaven, and concentrates his interests and affections there (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). "Seated" is placed with emphasis at the end of its clause, indicating the completeness of the Saviour's work and the dignity of his position (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; and see Pearson on the Creed, art. 6.). (For "the things above," see vers. 3, 4; also <a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a> and Colossians 2:18 compared with <a href="../../par/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11-14, 20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17-23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-49</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16-5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>.)

The Christian's <span class="accented">life</span> is lodged in the sphere of "the unseen and eternal."

The apostle says, "in God" ("in heaven," <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>), to emphasize the fact of the union of Christ with God, or perhaps to deepen the reader's sense of the sacredness of this life in Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14-16</a>). "Is hid" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3</a>), another allusion to the fondness of the Colossian errorists for <span class="accented">mysteries.</span> In <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a> St. Paul spoke of the ancient mystery of a Christ for all the world; then of the new, perpetual mystery of a Christ dwelling within believing hearts.

The body of "the new man" is physically identical with it, but different in moral habit and diathesis - a difference that manifests itself even in bodily expression and manner (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> occurs besides in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a> (in <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, a still stronger word is used of "the practices" of the body): as the aged Abraham had been <span class="accented">made dead</span> in respect of the natural possibility of fatherhood, so the body of the Christian is to be dead for purposes of sin. If there were any doubt as to the writer's meaning, the next clause removes it. His language has approached that of the philosophical ascetics (see <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, note and quotations); hence the abrupt explanatory apposition that follows: <span class="cmt_word">fornication, uncleanness,</span> (sensual) <span class="cmt_word">passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>). To these vices the Colossian Gentiles (some of them at least) had been to such a degree devoted that their <span class="accented">members</span> had become virtually identified therewith. The first two sins are related as particular and general. The second pair, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, are combined in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> in contrast to "(bodily) sanctification and honour" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, and "passions of dishonour," <a href="../../par/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>). The former denotes a morbid, inflamed condition of the sensual appetite; the latter, craving for some particular gratification of it (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). Neither of these words is etymologically, or invariably, evil in sense. The degradation of such terms in all languages is a sad evidence of the corruption of our nature. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is both wider and more intense in meaning than our "covetousness." It denotes radically the disposition to "have more," "grasping greed," "selfishness grown to a passion." Hence it applies to sins of impurity, greediness for sensual pleasure (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>); but by the emphatic use of the article ("the covetousness"), and by the words that follow, it is marked out as a distinct type of sin; so in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>, where "uncleanness" and "greed" are stigmatized as <span class="accented">vile</span> forms of sin. This word, often used by St. Paul, is peculiar to him in the New Testament. "The which" (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: setup. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>) gives a reason while it states a fact ("inasmuch as it is idolatry"). For the thought, setup. <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, also <a href="../../par/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; it is a commonplace of religion, and appears in Philo and Jewish rabbis (see Lightfoot). Lightfoot places a colon after "upon the earth," and supposes "fornication," etc., to be "proleptic accusatives," looking forward to some verb unexpressed, such as "put off" (ver. 8). But this is needless (see Winer, p. 666), and the command, "make dead your members," requires this qualifying explanation. The grammatical awkwardness of the apposition is not without rhetorical effect.

"Cometh" implies a continuing fact or fixed principle (see Winer, p. 332); or rather, perhaps, signifies that this "anger" is in course of manifestation, is "on the way:" comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>, "the anger that is coming," not "to come," also the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="../../par/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>.

"Full knowledge" was one purpose of this renewal, the purpose most necessary to be set before the Colossians. The nature and objects of this <span class="accented">knowledge</span> have been already specified (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 9, 27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3, 9, 10</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-31</a>; and on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>). "After (the) image" is clearly an allusion to <a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>; so in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a> ("after God"). It is adverbial to "renewed," not to "knowledge." Man's renewal in Christ makes him what the Creator at first designed him to be, namely, his own image (compare note on "reconcile," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). Chrysostom and others take "Christ" as "him that created," in view of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>; but then it is said that all things "were created <span class="accented">in</span>...  <span class="accented">through</span>...  <span class="accented">for</span> Christ," not absolutely that <span class="accented">Christ created</span> them. But "the image of God after which" man was created and is now recreated, is <span class="accented">seen</span> in Christ (<a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>).

That <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> means "can be," "negativing, not merely the fact, but the possibility," is doubtful in view of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-5.htm">1 Corinthians 6:5</a> (Revised Text). "In Christ" these distinctions are non-existent. There is no place for them. These and the following words indicate the sphere, as "unto knowledge" the end, and "after the image" the ideal or norm, of the progressive renewal to be effected in the Colossian believer. It can be carried on only where and so far as these distinctions are set aside. The "new man" knows nothing of them. The enmity between Greek and Jew being removed, the malice and falsehood that grew out of it will disappear (vers. 8, 9: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>). In <a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> "Jew" stands first, and the distinction of <span class="accented">sex</span> is added. The distinctions here enumerated appear as looked at from the Greek side. Only here in the New Testament does "Greek" precede "Jew" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>, etc.). "Barbarian" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>) and "Scythian" (only here in the New Testament) are together opposed to "Greek," and imply want of culture rather than alien nationality, the Scythian being the rudest of barbarians (see Lightfoot's full note). Such terms of contempt would, in Asia Minor, be commonly applied by Greeks to the native population. The party who affected philosophic culture (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 23</a>) may, perhaps, have applied them to simple, uneducated Christians (see note on Colossians 1:28). (On "circumcision," see <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; and for the connection with ver. 9, comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>.) For "bond" and "free," a division then pervading society universally, comp. Galatian list. Onesimus and Philemon are doubtless in the apostle's mind. On this relationship he enlarges in the next section (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-4:1</a>).

"Christ" stands at the end of the sentence, with accumulated emphasis. The Church regards and values each man in his relation to Christ, and bids every other consideration bow to this. He is "all things" - our common centre, our standard of reference, and fount of honour, the stun of all we acknowledge and desire; and he is "in all" - the common life and soul of his people, the substance of all we experience and possess as Christians. The second "all" is masculine (so most commentators, from Chrysostom downwards), referring more specially to the classes just enumerated. Similarly, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>.

Just as in the spiritual sphere, and in the relations between God and man, Christ is shown to be <span class="accented">all</span>, so that "principalities and powers" are comparatively insignificant (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10, 15</a>); so in the moral sphere, and in the relations between man and man. All human distinctions, like all angelic offices, must pay homage to his supremacy, and submit to the reconciling unity of his kingdom (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>).

The terms "elect," "holy" (same as "saints," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>; see note), "beloved," apply alike and separately to those addressed. Bengel, Meyer, Alford, Ellicott prefer to read "holy and beloved elect (ones);" but "holy" and "beloved" are used frequently by St. Paul as distinct substantive expressions, and indicate conditions ensuing on, rather than determining, <span class="accented">election.</span> Colossian believers are "elect" in virtue of an antecedent choice of them to salvation on the part of God, as those who would believe on his Son (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1, 2</a>).

"Elect" and "called," with St. Paul, are coextensive terms: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a> (R.V.) with this passage, also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26, 27</a>. To address the Colossian Christians as <span class="accented">elect</span> is to remind them of all that they owe to God's grace. "Elect" as chosen by God, they are "holy" as devoted to God. By the latter title they were first addressed (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>); holiness is the essence of Christian character. That they should gain this character and appear in it at the last judgment was the purpose of Christ's atoning death (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 22</a>), as it was the purpose of God's eternal election of believers (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). "And" is marked as doubtful by Lightfoot, Westcott and Heft; "it is impossible not to feel how much the sentence gains in form by its omission" (Lightfoot). "Beloved" (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is the perfect participle passive; it describes the position of those who, carrying out by their present holiness the purpose of their past election, are the objects of God's abiding love (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). This love dictated their election and set at work the means by which it should be secured (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9, 10</a>).

Christ is "the beloved One" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.), and those who are "in him" in their measure share the same title (<a href="../../par/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23-26</a>).

The objects of "pity" are the suffering and miserable; of "kindness," the needy and dependent. The "lowliness of mind" of <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18, 23</a> was something specious and to be guarded against; here it is the central and essential element of the true Christian temper (<a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>), its self-regarding element (<a href="../../par/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>). It is linked with meekness, as in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. "Pity" and "kindness," preceding "humility," relate to the claims of others upon us; "meekness" and "long suffering," to our bearing towards them. "Meekness," the opposite of rudeness and self assertion (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>), is a delicate consideration for the rights and feelings of others, especially necessary in administering rebuke or discipline (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>), and conspicuous in Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>). St. Peter marks it as a womanly virtue (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). "Long suffering" is called forth by the conduct of "the evil and unthankful" (see <a href="../../par/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>, and note). St. Paul claims this quality for himself (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>).

The words, "if any have any complaint," etc., would certainly apply to Philemon as against Onesimus (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-18.htm">Philemon 1:18, 19</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-5.htm">2 Corinthians 2:5-11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/11-25.htm">Mark 11:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even as the Lord</span> (or, <span class="accented">Christ</span>) <span class="cmt_word">forgave you, so also ye</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-27.htm">Matthew 18:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>). This argument is latent in the appeal to the "elect" and "beloved" of ver. 12. The evidence for the alternative readings, "Lord" and "Christ," is nearly equal in weight. In any case, the "Lord" is "Christ" in this passage (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17, 24</a>): and that <span class="accented">he</span> forgave (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, note) is quite consistent with the assertion that <span class="accented">God</span> forgave (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>), for God forgave "in Christ" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). So "God in Christ reconciled" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>); and yet "Christ reconciled us" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>). "Forgiving," supplied in thought from previous context, completes the sense of "so also ye" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott). To suppose an ellipsis of the imperative, with Light foot and the English Version ("do ye"), is needlessly to break the structure of the sentence. Ver. 14 shows that the leading imperative, "put on," of ver. 12 is still in the writer's mind. For the reciprocal double <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("even.., also"), comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a> or <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; it is characteristic of the writer.

"love" is the substance or substratum of the Christian virtues; in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a> it is their head and beginning; here it is that which embraces and completes them. They imply love, but it is more than them all together. They lie within its circumference; wanting it, they fall to pieces and are nothing.

In <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a> we have the "bond of peace" (see next verse). Love is <span class="accented">the bond</span> in the active sense, as that <span class="accented">wherewith</span> the constituents of a Christian character or the members of a Church are bound together: peace, in a passive sense, as that <span class="accented">wherein</span> the union consists (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>). "Love" (compare "covetousness," ver. 5) is made conspicuous by the Greek definite article - being <span class="accented">that eminent, essential</span> grace of Christian love (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>, etc.). "Perfectness" is genitive of object, not of quality: love unifies the elements of Christian goodness and gives them in itself their "perfectness" (<a href="../../par/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>). (For "perfectness," see note on "perfect," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; and comp. 4:12.) Against Galatian teachers of circumcision, and Corinthian exalters of knowledge, the apostle had magnified the supremacy of love (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>); and so against the Colossian mysticism and asceticism he sets it forth as the crown of spiritual perfection, the goal of human excellence (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>).

Here is the source of inner tranquillity and health of soul (see note on "peace," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); and of the outward union and harmony of the Church, the body of Christ (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15-19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>). In <a href="../../par/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Christ's peace</span>, his "legacy," is that which he possessed and exemplified - an idea foreign to this context. This "peace" is to "act as umpire" in the Christian's heart.

The Greek commentators seem, therefore, to be right, as against most moderns (but see Klopper on the other side), in retaining the primary sense of the verb instead of generalizing it into "rule" or the like. It stands in precise antithesis, both of sense and sound, to <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>: "Let not the deceivers decide against you, but let the peace of Christ decide in your hearts" (Cramer's 'Catena'). "The peace of Christ" dwelling within the heart is to be the security of the Colossian believer against the threats of false teachers: "They seek to rob you of your prize; let this assure you of it." Present, conscious peace with God is a warrant of the Christian's hope of everlasting life (<a href="../../par/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31-39</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>). This assurance is identical with "the witness of the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). The apostle argued in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 5</a> from the present faith and love of his readers to "the hope laid up for them in heaven;" here he bids them find in the peace which Christ has brought to their souls the earnest of their future bliss. It is but a generalizing of the same idea when he speaks in <a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a> of "the peace of God" as "garrisoning the heart and thoughts" against fear and doubt. <span class="cmt_word">Unto which also ye were called, in one body</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-18, 1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-17.htm">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>). So this "peace" is to be at once their inward safeguard, and the ground of their outward union. They are to stand together in its defence (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>). Error, which blights the Church's <span class="accented">hope</span>, destroys her unity. So the maintenance of that "one hope of our calling," assured by a Divine peace within the soul, unites all Christian hearts in a common cause (compare the connection of vers. 18 and 19 in <a href="../../par/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>.). With St. Paul, the peace of God's children with him and with each other is so essentially one that he speaks almost indistinguishably of both (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He adds, and be ye thankful</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>); viz. "for this assurance of your future blessedness afforded by the peace of Christ within your hearts, with its outward evidence in your Christian unity." The apostle gave thanks for them on like grounds (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5</a>: comp. 1:12-14). The command <span class="accented">to give thanks</span> prevails in this Epistle, as that <span class="accented">to rejoice</span> in Philippians. "Be" is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("become"); so in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1, 17</a>. It implies "striving after an aim as not yet realized" (Meyer: comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>) - rather, therefore, "to be in act," "to prove" or "show one's self thankful" (see Grimm's 'Lexicon;' and comp. <a href="../../par/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-36.htm">Luke 10:36</a>).

This precise phrase occurs <span class="accented">only</span> here, where the name of <span class="accented">Christ</span> is emphasized in so many ways (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>). The apostle, it may be, alludes primarily to the personal teaching of Christ himself (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>). "You" is understood collectively by Meyer and others ("amongst you"); but the verb "dwell in" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5, 14</a>) requires the stronger sense, suggested also by the "in your hearts" of ver. 15 (comp. note on "in you," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). As "the word" is rich in the Divine wealth stored in it (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-6.htm">Titus 3:6</a>), so it is to dwell "richly" in those who possess it. "In all wisdom" God's grace abounded (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-8.htm">Ephesians 1:8</a>), and St. Paul himself taught (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>); so with the <span class="accented">richly indwelling word</span> in the minds of the Colossians, especially as they were beset by intellectual forms of error (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-4, 8, 23</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15</a>). In this connection of thought, the phrase appears to belong to the previous sentence; so English Version and Lightfoot. Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and Ellicott, however, attach it to the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Teaching and admonishing each other</span> [or, <span class="accented">yourselves:</span> comp. ver. 13, note] (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>).

What he is doing in his own ministry and by writing this letter, he bids the Colossians do for each other. "Teaching" precedes, being suggested by "wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">With psalms, hymns, spiritual songs</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>). These are to be a chief means of mutual edification. The repeated "and," also the singular "heart," and "Lord" in place of "God" in the sequel of the verse, are borrowed by the Received Text from <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>. The Greeks, the Asiatic Greeks in particular, were devoted to the arts of music. Song and jest, stimulated by the wine cup, were the entertainment of their social hours (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4, 18, 19</a>). Their Christian intercourse is still to be enlivened by the varied use of song, and by the play of wholesome wit (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>); but both song and speech are to be "in grace," stamped with a spiritual character and governed by a serious Christian purpose. A "psalm" (from <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to play</span> an instrument) is "a song set to music;" but this name was already in the LXX appropriated to its present use. Whether its application here is restricted to the psalms of the Old Testament is doubtful (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15, 26</a>). "Hymn" (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) denotes a solemn, religions composition, or song of Divine praise. The word "song" (<span class="accented">ode</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1fa0;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>) is wider in sense; hence is qualified by "spiritual," equivalent to "with [or, 'in'] the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>) - "songs of a spiritual nature, inspired by the Holy Ghost" (comp. "spiritual wisdom," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>). Such songs would echo the varied sentiments and experiences of the Christian life. In <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11-13</a>, very possibly, we have fragments of early Christian song. St. Paul's own language, in more exalted moods, tends to assume a rhythmic and lyrical strain (see introductory note on Colossians 1:15-20). <span class="cmt_word">In grace singing, in your hearts, to God</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2, 15, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-19.htm">1 John 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>).

The tendency to omit the article in prepositional phrases should be taken into account in its favour here. And the article helps the sense by giving "grace" a definite Christian meaning (so "the love," ver. 14). Otherwise, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> may mean no more than "gracefully," "pleasantly;" comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>.

In <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a> we read, "with your hearts" - the instrument (here the region) of the song.

THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF FAMILY DUTIES. We note that in each of the three family relations here dealt with, the subordinate party is first addressed, and the duty of submission is primarily insisted upon (vers. 18, 20, 22: comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>).

As in the case of Luther, the apostle's later teaching is largely directed against the antinomianism which resulted, by way of perversion and abuse, from the preaching of salvation by grace and of the sanctity of the individual believer (comp. introductory note to this chapter). Observe how <span class="accented">the Lord</span> and his authority are made to furnish a higher sanction for each of these natural duties. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fit in the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11-15</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). On this duty the apostle dilates in the Ephesian letter, in illustration of its teaching respecting "Christ and the Church" (comp. the very different treatment of it in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-7</a>), The use of the <span class="accented">article</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) in the nominative of address is frequent in New Testament, though not in classical Greek. Lightfoot thinks it Hebraistic. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> stands in the imperfect tense (literally, <span class="accented">it was</span> fit), denoting a normal propriety (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4</a>, Westcott and Hort; and for the general expression, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-13.htm">1 Corinthians 11:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-8.htm">Philemon 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>). Like all men of a sound moral nature, St Paul has a strong sense of natural propriety. The adjunct "in the Lord" belongs to "was fit," not "be subject" (comp. ver. 20). The constitution of nature, as we have learnt in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>, is grounded "in the Lord." In <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a> St. Paul shows that this inherent propriety has a deep spiritual significance; and he makes the subjection of the Church to her heavenly Lord a new reason for wifely submission.

Here, first and most of all, the "new commandment" of <a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> applies. St. Paul only uses the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> ("to make bitter") here, but he has the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("bitterness") in a wider application in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>. It denotes "exasperation," prompting to hasty severity. Bengel defines it as "odium amori mixtum" - hatred infused into love.

But here, where "Christ is all and in all" (ver. 11), it is "in the Lord" (Revised Text) that the child's obedience is declared to be "well pleasing." There is something especially pleasing in the behaviour of a lovingly obedient child, that wins "favour" both "with God and man" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>). The law of filial obedience has its creative ground "in him" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>), and is an essential part of the Christian order of life, which is the natural order restored and perfected. "Well pleasing" is a favourite word of St. Paul's (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-10.htm">Ephesians 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-9.htm">Titus 2:9</a>, etc.; used also in Hebrews).

The servant whose aim it is to please his earthly master in what will catch his eye, plays a <span class="accented">double</span> part, acting in one way when observed, in another when left to himself; with this duplicity is contrasted "singleness of heart" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a> and 1 Cor 9:11, 13 has a different application). "Fearing the Lord" more than the eye of his earthly lord, the Christian servant will always act in "singleness of heart;" for "the eyes of the Lord are in every place."

The word "not" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>) implies that their service is actually rendered to One other and higher than "men" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).

"The absence of the definite article" before <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> "is the more remarkable, because it is studiously inserted in the context" (Lightfoot). St. Paul virtually says, "There is <span class="accented">a Master</span> who will recompense you, if your earthly masters never do" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>).

The opposite truth is asserted in ver. 25; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a> combines them both. The recompense of the faithful Christian slave is nothing less than "the inheritance" of God's children (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 11, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>), which the apostle has so often under other terms assured to his readers (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 23, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 15</a>). For a <span class="accented">slave</span> to be heir was "a paradox" (Lightfoot): see <a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>. No form of praise could be more cheering and ennobling to the despised slave than this. "In Christ," Onesimus is "no longer as a slave, but a brother beloved" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>), and if a brother, then a joint heir with his master Philemon in the heavenly inheritance (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye serve the Lord Christ</span> (vers. 22, 25; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>); that is, <span class="accented">Christ is the Lord whose bondmen ye are.</span> "For" is probably a correct gloss, though a corrupt reading. Its insertion indicates that the sentence was read indicatively (Lightfoot, and R.V.); not imperatively ("serve the Lord Christ"), as Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, with the Vulgate, construe it. The verse amounts to this: "Work as for the Lord: he will repay you; you are his servants." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a></div><div class="verse">But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he that doeth wrong shall receive again that he did wrong; and there is no respect of persons</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5-7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-17.htm">1 Peter 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>). "For" is replaced by "but" in the same inferior copies which insert it in the last sentence. Here we have the ether side of the recompense promised in ver. 24 <span class="accented">a</span>, to which the explanatory "for" points back. The impartial justice which avenges every wrong guarantees the reward of the faithful servant of Christ. So the Old Testament saints rightly argued (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7-10</a>) that the punishment of the evil doer affords hope to the righteous man. This warning is quite general in its terms, and applies alike to the unfaithful servant and to the unjust master (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>). At the judgment seat of Christ there will be no favouritism: all ranks and orders of men will stand on precisely the same footing (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, twice employed here, denotes a legal wrong or injury (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7, 8</a>); <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the conduct of Onesimus towards Philemon (ver. 18).

The apostle turns from the slave to address his master. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ch. 4:1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye lords, show just dealing and fairness to your servants</span> [<span class="accented">bondmen</span>] (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23-35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>). The verb "show" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">afford, render</span>) is middle in voice, and, as in <a href="../../par/luke/7-4.htm">Luke 7:4</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>, implies spontaneity - "show on your part," "of yourselves." <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("the just"), a concrete expression, denotes the justice of the master's <span class="accented">dealing</span> (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>, "the kind dealing of God"). <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> gives the principle by which he is to be guided, that of <span class="accented">equity, fairness</span> (so Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot). "Equity is the mother of Justice" (Philo, 'On the Creation of Magistrates,' &sect; 14; see other illustrations in Lightfoot). Meyer contends for the stricter sense, "equality" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-13.htm">2 Corinthians 8:13, 14</a>) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Church status and brotherhood (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). But the context suggests no such special reference; it deals with the family and social relationship of master and servant "Equity" is a well-established sense of the Greek word. The law of equity bearing on all human relations Christ has laid down in <a href="../../par/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>. Here is the germinal principle of the abolition of slavery. Moral equity, as realized by the Christian consciousness, was sure in course of time to bring about legal equality. Knowing that ye also have a Lord in heaven (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). (On "knowing," see ver. 24 a.) "Ye also," for Christ is "both their Lord and yours" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>, Revised Text). The lordship of Christ dominates the whole Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 10, 19</a>, etc.). The assertion that the proud master who deemed his fellow man his chattel is himself a mere <span class="accented">slave</span> of Christ, sets Christ's authority in a vivid and striking light. This consideration makes the Christian master apprehensive as to his treatment of his dependents. <span class="accented">He</span> is "in heaven" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>), the seat of Divine authority and glory, whence he shall soon return to judgment (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/76-8.htm">Psalm 76:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../colossians/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Colossians 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Colossians 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../colossians/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Colossians 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Colossians 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
