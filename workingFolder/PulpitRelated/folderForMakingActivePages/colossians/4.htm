It is fanciful to give "door" here the sense of "mouth." The "opening of my mouth," in <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>, expresses the subjective freedom (corresponding to "as I ought to speak," ver. 4); "the door for the word," the objective liberty desired by St. Paul in his imprisonment. <span class="cmt_word">To speak the mystery of Christ, because of which also I am bound</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23-29</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8-10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-24</a>).

(On "mystery," see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>.) It is this very mission which makes him long for freedom, that keeps him a prisoner (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-13.htm">Ephesians 3:13</a>). He is in the strange position of an "ambassador in chains" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9, 10</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).

This injunction appears in a different form and position in Ephesians. Standing at the close of the writer's exhortations, and followed up by the direction of the next verse, it is more pointed and emphatic here. <span class="cmt_word">Buying up each</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>opportunity</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-32.htm">Luke 13:32</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>). In <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a> the reason is added, "because the days are evil." In <a href="../../par/daniel/2-8.htm">Daniel 2:8</a> (LXX) the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> ("to buy out" or "up," a word of the market) has precisely this sense and connection, and the idiom occurs in classical writers. The verb is middle in voice: "buying up for yourselves," "for your own advantage." In <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> the compound verb is somewhat differently used. <span class="accented">The opportunity</span> is the fit time for each step of a well-conducted walk, the precise juncture of circumstances which must be seized at once or it is gone. This wary promptitude is always needful in dealing with men of the world, both to avoid harm from them and in seeking to do them good. The latter thought, it may be, connects this verse and the next.

"Word" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) has its common acceptation, as in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-8.htm">Titus 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>. "With grace" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) gives the pervading element of Christian speech; as "in wisdom," of Christian behaviour (ver. 5). "Grace," here without the article, is not, as in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>, where the article should probably be read, "the (Divine) grace," but a property of speech itself, "gracefulness" the kindly, winning pleasantness which makes the talk of a good and thoughtful man attractive: comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a> (44:3, LXX); <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:12</a> (LXX); Sir. 21:16. "Salt" is the "wholesome point and pertinency" (Ellicott) <span class="accented">seasoning</span> conversation, while grace <span class="accented">sweetens</span> it. The clause which follows indicates that "salt" denotes here, as commonly in Greek (instance the phrase, "Attic salt"), an intellectual rather than a moral quality of speech. In <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a> the connection is different, and the application more general (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49, 50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That you may know how you ought to answer each one</span> (ver. 4; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>). The Colossians were to pray for the apostle that he might "speak the mystery of Christ... as he ought to speak;" and he bids them seek for themselves the same gift of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, liberty of speech and readiness to "every good word." For their faith was assailed by persuasive sophistry (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8, 23</a>) and by brew-beating dogmatism (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16, 18, 20, 21</a>). They were, like St. Paul, "set for the defence of the gospel," placed in the van of the conflict against heresy. They needed, therefore, "to have all their wits about them," so as to be able, as occasion required, to make answer to each of their opponents and questioners, that they might "contend" wisely as well as "earnestly for the faith." <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a> is a commentary on this verse: the parallelism is the closer because that Epistle was addressed to Churches in Asia Minor, where the debates out of which Gnosticism arose were beginning to be rife; and because, likewise, "the hope that was in them" was a chief object of the attack made on the Colossian believers (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 23, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>). With this exhortation the Christian teaching of the Epistle is concluded. In its third and practical part (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4:6</a>) the apostle has built up, on the foundation of the doctrine laid down in the first chapter, and in place of the attractive but false and pernicious system denounced in the second, a lofty and complete ideal of the Christian life. He has led us from the contemplation of its "life of life" in the innermost mystery of union with Christ and of its glorious destiny in him (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>), through the soul's interior death-struggle with its old corruptions (vers. 5-11) and its investment with the graces of its new life (vers. 12-15), to the expression and outward acting of that life in the mutual edification of the Church (vers. 16, 17), in the obedience and devotion of the family circle (ver. 18 - <a href="../../par/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>), in constant prayerfulness and sympathy with the ministers and suffering witnesses of Christ (vers. 2-4), and, lastly, in such converse with men of the world, and in the midst of the distracting debate by which faith is assailed, as shall fittingly commend the Christian cause.

PERSONAL MESSAGES AND GREETINGS. St. Paul concludes his letter, first, by introducing to the Colossians its bearer, Tychicus, along with whom he commends to them their own Onesimus, returning to his master (vers. 7-9); then, according to his custom, he conveys greetings from his various friends and helpers present with him at the time, in particular from Mark, who was likely to visit them, and from Epaphras their own devoted minister (vers. 10-14); thirdly, he sends greeting to the neighbouring and important Church of Laodicea, specially mentioning Nympha, with directions to exchange letters with the Laodiceans, and with a pointed warning to Archippus, probably a Colossian, having some charge over that Church (vers. 15-17). Finally, he appends, with his own hand, his apostolic greeting and benediction (ver. 18). The personal references of this section, though slight and cursory, are of peculiar value, bearing themselves the strongest marks of genuineness, and decisively attesting the Pauline authorship of the Epistle. At the same time, we gather from them several independent facts throwing light on St. Paul's position during his imprisonment, and on his relations to other leading personages of the Church. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that relates to me</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the things concerning me</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant</span> (<span class="accented">bondman</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>will make known to you</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; 1:8; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>).

He accompanied the apostle on his voyage to Jerusalem (A.D. 58), with a number of others representing different Churches, and deputed, as Lightfoot thinks, in conformity with the directions of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3, 4</a>, to convey the contributions raised for "the poor saints at Jerusalem." Trophimus was with St. Paul in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>), and so, probably, his colleague (the words, "as far as Asia," in <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, are of very doubtful authority), he is now with the apostle in his imprisonment at Rome, about to be sent home with these two letters (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>), and in charge of Onesimus, on whose account the apostle sends a private letter to Philemon. In the interval between the first (present) and second imprisonment (2 Timothy), the apostle revisited the Asiatic Churches (so we infer from <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>), and Tychicus rejoined him; for we find St. Paul proposing to send him to Titus in Crete (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), and finally sending him from Rome once more to Ephesus (2 Timothy 6:12). These facts sustain the high terms in which he is here spoken cf. "In the Lord" belongs both to "minister" and "fellow servant." This language is almost identical with that used of Epaphras in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see notes). Tychicus is "minister" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), not to Paul himself (<a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), nor in the official sense of <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, but "of Christ," "of the gospel," or "the Church" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), as St. Paul himself (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23, 25</a>). He is "a beloved brother" to his fellow believers, "a faithful minister" of the Lord Christ, and "a fellow servant" with the apostle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>).

The Received Text reads, by a slight confusion of similar Greek letters, <span class="accented">that he may know the things about you</span> (see Lightfoot's 'Notes on some Various Readings'). This is the only clause exactly identical in Colossians and Ephesians. There would be great anxiety on St. Paul's account amongst the Gentile Christians everywhere, and especially in the Asiatic Churches, after the ominous words of his address to the Ephesian elders (<a href="../../par/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-25</a>: comp. vers. 37, 38). The Colossians had sent through Epaphras messages of love to him (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>). To know that he was of good courage, and even in hope of a speedy release (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>), would "comfort their hearts."

"In Christ there is no slave" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). Onesimus, like Epaphras and Tychicus, is a <span class="accented">brother, to be trusted</span> and <span class="accented">loved</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10-17</a>). This language strongly supports the appeal of ver. 1, and would further the purpose of the apostle's intercession to Onesimus' master. And Onesimus even shares with the honoured Tychicus in the privilege of being the apostle's messenger! <span class="cmt_word">All things that are happening here they will make known to you</span> (ver. 7; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>). There is, therefore, no need for any detailed account of the writer's circumstances. The solicitude which he assumes that these stranger Colossians (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>) feel on his behalf shows how commanding his ascendancy over the Gentile Churches had become.

Aristarchus, as a Thessalonian, accompanied the apostle to Jerusalem, along with Tychicus the Asian (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), and was his companion at least during the first part of his voyage to Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>). In <a href="../../par/philemon/1-23.htm">Philemon 1:23, 24</a> his name follows that of Mark as a "fellow worker" (comp. ver. 11) and of Epaphras "my fellow prisoner" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>). "Fellow prisoner" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">captive, prisoner of war</span>) differs from the "prisoner" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">one in bonds</span>) of <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>. The supposition that these men were permitted as friends to share St. Paul's captivity in turn, is conjectural (see Meyer). Possibly the incident recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> was attended by some temporary joint imprisonment of St. Paul and Aristarchus. As "a soldier of Christ Jesus," the apostle was himself now "a prisoner of war" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3-6</a>); and therefore those who shared his sufferings were his "fellow prisoners," as they were his" fellow soldiers" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a>) and his "fellow servants" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, about whom you received commandments - if he should come to you, welcome him</span> (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>). It is pleasant to find John Mark, who deserted the apostle in his first missionary journey (<a href="../../par/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>), and on whose account he separated from Barnabas (<a href="../../par/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-40</a>) ten years before, now taken again into his confidence and friendship (comp. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). And indeed it is evident that there was no permanent estrangement between the two great Gentile missionaries; for Mark is called "cousin of Barnabas" by way of recommendation (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 9, 13</a>). Mary, the mother of John Mark, was a person of some consideration in the Church at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>), and through her he may have been related to Barnabas, who, though a Cypriot Jew, had property near Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36, 37</a>), and was also highly honoured by the mother Church (<a href="../../par/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25, 26</a>). Mark is, moreover, a link between the Apostles Paul and Peter. It is to the house of his mother that the latter betakes himself on his escape from Herod's prison (<a href="../../par/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>). In <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a> he appears, along with Silvanus (Silos), St. Paul's old comrade, in St. Peter's company, who calls him "my son." St. Peter was then at Babylon, where Mark may have arrived at the end of the journey eastwards which St. Paul here contemplates his undertaking. The striking correspondence of language and thought between St. Peter's First Epistle (addressed, moreover, to Churches of Asia Minor) and those of St. Paul to the Ephesians and Colossians (and, in an equal degree, that to the Romans) suggests the existence of some special connection at this time between the two writers, such as may well have been afforded by Mark, if, leaving Rome soon after the despatch of these letters, he travelled in their track by way of Asia Minor to join St. Peter at Babylon. At the time of St. Paul's second imprisonment, about four years later, Mark is again in Asia Minor in the neighbourhood of Timothy, and the apostle desires his services at Rome (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). When or how the Colossians had received already directions concerning Mark, we have no means of knowing. His journey appears to have been postponed. The apostle must before this have communicated with the Colossians. The visit of Epaphras to Rome may have been due to some communication from him. "If he should come to you, give him a welcome," is the request the apostle now makes.

Aristarchus, therefore, was a Jew, as well as Mark and Jesus Justus. "These only," etc., must be read as in close apposition to the previous clause. This statement accords with the apostle's complaint in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-24</a>; but the still stronger language of the latter passages seems to point to a later time when he was yet more solitary, having lost Tychicus and Mark, and perhaps Aristarchus also, and when he had a more definite prospect of release. The title "fellow worker" he frequently confers on his associates (see references). In <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> it is applied, to Luke and Demas also.

The apostle loves to commend his fellow labourers (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20-22, 25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis</span> (vers. 15-17; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). The Church in Hierapolis is added to that of Laodicea, singled out in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a> as a special object of the apostle's concern (on these cities, see Introduction, &sect; 1). Whether Epaphras were the official head of these Churches or not, he could not but be deeply concerned in their welfare. Ver. 17 indicates the existence of a personal link between the Churches of Colossus and of Laodicea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Luke the physician, the beloved, saluteth you</span> (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). This reference to Luke's profession is extremely interesting. We gather from the use of the first person plural in <a href="../../par/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10-17</a>, and again from Acts 20:5 to the end of the narrative, that he joined St. Paul on his first voyage to Europe and was left behind at Philippi; and rejoined him six years after on the journey to Jerusalem which completed his third missionary circuit, continuing with him during his voyage to Rome and his imprisonment. This faithful friend attended him in his second captivity, and solaced his last hours; "Only Luke is with me" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). His being called "the physician" suggests that he ministered to the apostle in this capacity, especially as "his first appearance in St. Paul's company synchronizes with an attack of St. Paul's constitutional malady" (Lightfoot: comp. <a href="../../par/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-15</a>; the illness referred to in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</a> and 2 Cor 4:7-5:8 may partly have led to Luke's rejoining St. Paul in Macedonia). St Luke's writings testify both to his medical knowledge and to his Pauline sympathies. His companionship probably gave a special colouring to the phraseology and cast of thought of St. Paul's later Epistles. (On the relations of St. Luke and St. Paul, see a valuable Paper by Dean Plumptre in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 4. pp. 134-156.) "The beloved" is a distinct appellation, due partly to Luke's services to the apostle, but chiefly, one would suppose, to the amiable and gentle disposition of the writer of the third Gospel. It is not unlikely that he is "the brother" referred to in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-18.htm">2 Corinthians 8:18, 19</a>. <span class="accented">Lucas</span> is a contraction for <span class="accented">Lucanus</span>; so that he was not the "Lucius" of <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, nor, certainly, the "Lucius my kinsman" of <a href="../../par/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>, who was a Jew. He was probably, like many physicians of that period, a freedman; and, since freedmen took the name of the house to which they had belonged, may have been, as Plumptre conjectures, connected with the family of the Roman philosopher Seneca and the poet Lucan. <span class="cmt_word">And Demas</span> (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>), who alone receives no word of commendation - a fact significant in view of the melancholy sentence pronounced upon him in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>. His name is probably short for <span class="accented">Demetrius.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/4-15.htm">Colossians 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea</span> (ver. 13; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>). Perhaps the brethren in Hierapolis (ver. 13) were not formed into a distinct Church as yet (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). The Church in Laodicea early became a flourishing and wealthy community (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Nympha</span> (or, <span class="accented">Nymphas</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and the Church</span> (literally, <span class="accented">assembly</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>at her</span> (or, <span class="accented">their</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>house.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> may be either masculine or feminine accusative. The reading "her" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) is adopted by Westcott and Hort without alternative, and seems on the whole the most probable. The Revised Text follows Tischendorf, Tregelles, Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, who read "their" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). "His" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) is evidently a later correction. Lightfoot says, indeed, that "a Doric form of the Greek name (<span class="accented">sc.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) seems in the highest degree improbable;" but he allows, on the other hand, that <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> as a contracted masculine form (for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) "is very rare." This person was apparently a leading member of the Laodicean Church, at whose house Church meetings were held (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). "The Church at her house" can scarcely have been an assembly distinct "from the brethren that are in Laodicea." Both expressions may relate to the same body of persons, referred first individually, then collectively as a meeting gathered at this place. Others suppose a more private gathering to be meant, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Colossians living at Laodicea (Meyer). Many older interpreters identified this Church with <span class="accented">the household</span> of Nymphas. If "their" be the true reading, the expression must include <span class="accented">Nympha and her family.</span> Nympha (or Nymphas), like Philemon and his family, St. Paul had doubtless met in Ephesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the <i>epistle</i> from Laodicea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when this letter has been read among you, see to it</span> (literally, <span class="accented">cause</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that it be read also in the Church of</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Laodiceans</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>). For these two Churches were closely allied in origin and condition, as well as by situation and acquaintanceship (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). The leaven of the Colossian error was doubtless beginning to work in Laodicea also. The words addressed to Laodicea in the Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>) bear reference apparently to the language of this Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 41, etc. The phrase, "Church of Laodiceans," corresponds to that used in the salutation of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, but is not found elsewhere in St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">And that ye also read the letter from Laodicea.</span> What was this letter? Clearly <span class="accented">a letter from St. Paul</span> which would be received at Laodicea, and which the Colossians were to obtain from there. The connection of this sentence with the foregoing, and the absence of any other definition of the words, "the letter (from Laodicea)," make this evident. Nothing further can be affirmed with certainty. But several considerations point to the probability that this missing Epistle is none other than our (so-called) Epistle to the Ephesians. For: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Both letters were sent at the same time, and by the same messenger (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The relation between the two is more intimate than exists between any other of St. Paul's writings; they are <span class="accented">twins</span>, the birth of the same crisis in the condition of the Church and in the apostle's own mind. Each serves as a commentary on the other. And there are several important topics, lightly touched upon in this letter, on which the writer dilates at length in the other (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a> <span class="accented">b</span> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> <span class="accented">b</span>-25 and <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> <span class="accented">a</span>, 24 <span class="accented">b</span>, 2:19 and <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-16, 5</a>:23-32; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 27, 2</a>:11-13, 3:11 and <a href="../../par/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> ("Firstborn out of the dead"), 2:12 <span class="accented">b</span> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a> ("God's elect") and <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18, 19</a> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>). On the other hand, the main arguments of the Colossian letter are, as it seems, assumed and presupposed in the Ephesian (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10, 20</a> <span class="accented">b-</span>23, 2:20 <span class="accented">b</span>, 3:8 <span class="accented">b-</span>11, 19 <span class="accented">b</span>, 4:13 <span class="accented">b</span> with <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20, 2</a>:9, 10; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> with <a href="../../par/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8, 16-23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x1ff3;</span> in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a> are of doubtful authenticity; and there is much in the internal character of that Epistle to favour the hypothesis, proposed by Archbishop Usher, that it was <span class="accented">a circular letter</span>, destined for a number of Churches in Asia Minor, of which Ephesus may have been the first and Laodicea the last (compare the <span class="accented">order</span> of <a href="../../par/revelation/2-3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>.). In that case a copy of the Ephesian Epistle would be left at Laodicea by Tychicus on his way to Colossae. (See Introduction, &sect; 6; compare that to Ephesians.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Marcion, in the middle of the second century (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:11, 17), entitled the Epistle to the Ephesians, "To the Laodiceans." It does not appear that his heretical views could have been furthered by this change. Probably his statement contains a fragment of ancient tradition, identifying the Epistle in question with that referred to by St. Paul in this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The expression, "the letter <span class="accented">from Laodicea</span>," would scarcely be used of a letter addressed simply <span class="accented">to the Laodiceans</span> and belonging properly to them; but would be quite appropriate to a more general Epistle transmitted from one place to another. There is extant in Latin a spurious epistle 'Ad Laodicenses,' which is traced back to the fourth century, and was widely accepted in the Middle Ages; but it is "a mere cento of Pauline phrases, strung together without any definite connection or any clear object" (Lightfoot). (On this curious forgery, and on the whole subject of "the Epistle from Laodicea," see Lightfoot's masterly discussion, pp. 274  - 300; also p. 37.) Meyer, on the other hand, in his 'Introduction to Ephesians,' pronounces strongly against "the circular hypothesis." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou receivedst in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Lord, that thou fulfil it</span> (<a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6, 11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13, 14, 20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>). From the connection of this verse with the two preceding, it seems likely that "the ministry" of Archippus related to the Laodicean Church. Hence he is not addressed directly. If he was, as we gather from <a href="../../par/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 1, 2</a>, the son of Philemon, whose house formed a centre for the Colossian Church (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>), the warning would be suitably conveyed through this channel. In the letter to Philemon, the apostle calls him his" fellow soldier" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29, 30</a>). Both from this fact, and from the emphasis of the words before us, it would appear that his office was an important one, probably that of chief pastor. This warning addressed so early to the minister of the Laodicean Church is premonitory of the lapsed condition in which it is afterwards found (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 42, 43.

So the apostle appends his authenticating signature to the letter, written, as usual, by his amanuensis, himself inscribing these last words (see parallel passages).
