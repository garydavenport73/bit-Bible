He shows an occasional self distrust rising from the consciousness of personal infirmities. This enhances our sense of his heroic courage and endurance. Doubtless this physical weakness and nervous depression were connected with his "stake in the flesh," which seems to have been an acute and distressing form of ophthalmia, accompanied with cerebral disturbance (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:215-221). <span class="cmt_word">In fear, and in much trembling.</span> Probably the words are even literally true, though they are a common phrase (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). It must be remembered that in his first visit to Corinth St. Paul had gone through stormy and troubled days (<a href="../../par/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1-12</a>).

This simplicity was the more remarkable because "Corinthian words" was a proverb for choice, elaborate, and glittering phrases (Wetstein). It is not improbable that the almost total and deeply discouraging want of success of St. Paul in preaching at Athens had impressed him mere strongly with the uselessness of attempting to fight Greek philosophers with their own blunt and imperfect weapons. <span class="cmt_word">In demonstration of the Spirit and of power</span>. So he says to the Thessalonians," Our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance." The plain facts, so repellent to the natural intellect, were driven home with matchless force by spiritual conviction. The only heathen critic who has mentioned St. Paul's method is Longinus, the author of the treatise on 'The Sublime and Beautiful,' who calls him "a master of unproved dogma," meaning apparently that his force lay in the irresistible statement of the facts which he came to preach.

Ignatius (?) seems to have understood it thus; for he adopted the strange notion that "the prince of this aeon" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Satan) had been deceived and frustrated by the incarnation from a virgin, and the death on the cross (Ignat., 'Ad. Ephesians,' 19). It means more probably "wisdom," as understood by Roman governors and Jewish Sanhedrists, who treated the Divine wisdom of the gospel with sovereign contempt (<a href="../../par/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That [who] come to nought</span>; literally, <span class="accented">who are being done away with.</span> Amid all the feebleness of the infant Church, St. Paul saw empires vanishing before it.

The thought seems to be, "But God has revealed to us things which eye hath not seen, etc., though the princes of this world were ignorant of them." Scriptural quotations are often thus introduced, apart from the general grammar of the sentence, as in the Greek of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Eye hath not seen,</span> etc. The Revised Version is here more literal and accurate. The quotation as it stands is not found in the Old Testament. It most resembles <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, but also vaguely resembles Isaiah 53:15; 65:17. It may be another instance of a loose general reminiscence (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). "Non verbum e verbo expressit," says St. Jerome, "sed <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;</span> aliis sermonibus indicavit." St. Chrysostom regards the words as part of a lost prophecy. Origen, Zacharias of Chrysopolis, and others say that the words occurred in an apocryphal book, the 'Apocalypse of Elias,' but if so the apocryphal writer must have had the passage of Isaiah in his mind. Some regard the words as a fragment of some ancient liturgy. Origen thought that they came from the 'Revelation of Elijah.' They were also to be found in the 'Ascension of Isaiah' (Jerome on <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>). and they occur in the Talmud (Sanhedr. 99 a). In a curious fragment of Hegesippus (circ.  <span class="date">A.D. 150</span>) preserved in Photius (Cod. 232.), that old writer indignantly repudiates this passage, saying that it is futile and "utterly belies (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the Holy Scriptures and the Lord, who says, 'Blessed are your eyes which see, and your ears which hear.'" Photius cannot understand why (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>) Hegesippus should speak thus. Routh ('Rel. Sacr.,' 253) hardly knows how to excuse him; but perhaps if we had the context of the fragment we should see that he is attacking, not the words themselves, but some perversion of them by heretics, like the Docetae. The phrase, "As it is written," decisively marks an intention to refer to Scripture. Neither have entered into the heart of man; literally, <span class="accented">things which have not set foot upon the heart.</span> The general thought is that God's revelations (for the immediate reference is to <span class="accented">these</span>, and <span class="accented">not</span> to future bliss) pass all understanding. The quotation of these words as referring to heaven is one of the numberless instances of texts inaccurately applied.

This elementary truth is again and again insisted on in Scripture, and ignored by sceptics (<a href="../../par/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</a>). This verse is sometimes used to depreciate knowledge, reason, and intellect. On that abuse of the passage, see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3. 8:4-11, an admirable passage, which Bishop Wordsworth quotes at length. It is, perhaps, sufficient to say that if God has no need of human knowledge, he has still less need of human ignorance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-15.htm">1 Corinthians 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judgeth all things</span>. If he can judge the higher, lie can of course judge the lower. Being spiritual, he becomes intellectual also, as well as <span class="accented">more than</span> intellectual. He can see into the difference between the dream and the reality; he can no longer take the shadow for the substance. He can not only decide about ordinary matters, but can also "discriminate the transcendent," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> see that which is best even in different alternatives of good. "The <span class="accented">secret</span> of the Lord is with them that fear him" (<a href="../../par/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He himself is judged of no man.</span> He may be judged, condemned, depreciated, slandered every day of his life, but the arrow flights of human judgment fall far short of him. These Corinthians were judging and comparing Paul and Apollos and Cephas; but their judgments were false and worthless, and Paul told them that it was less than nothing to him to be judged by them or by man's feeble transitory day (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3</a>). "Evil men," as Solomon said, "understand not judgment" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath known the mind of the Lord?</span> "The Lord" is Jehovah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a>, LXX.; <a href="../../par/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>). This is the <span class="accented">reason</span> why no one can judge the spiritual man in his spiritual life. To do so is like judging God. <span class="cmt_word">We have the mind of Christ.</span> So Christ himself had told the apostles (<a href="../../par/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>); and St. Paul always claimed to have been taught by direct revelation from Christ (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>). They had the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> of Christ (<a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>), and therefore the <span class="accented">mind</span> of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_corinthians/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Corinthians 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_corinthians/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Corinthians 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
