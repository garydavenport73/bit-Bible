Being free and an apostle, he could, if he had chosen, have claimed, as others had done, a right to be supported by the Churches to which he preached, he had thought it more for their good to waive this claim, and therefore he had done so at the cost (as appears in many other passages: <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) of bitter hardship to himself. But St. Paul practically "goes off" at the word "apostle." It was so essential for him to vindicate, against the subterranean malignity of hostile partisans, his dignity as an apostle, that in asserting that authority he almost loses sight for the time of the main object for which he had alluded to the fact. Hence much that he says is of the nature of a digression - though an important one - until he resumes the main thread of his subject at <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?</span> Doubtless he mainly refers to the vision on the road to Damascus (<a href="../../par/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>), though he received other visions and revelations also (<a href="../../par/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>, etc.). he had probably not seen Christ during his life on earth (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:73-75).

This plain meaning, however, involving the assertion that the apostles and desposyni ("the Lord's brethren") were married men, was so distasteful to the morbid asceticism which held celibacy in a sort of Manichaean reverence, that the scribes of the fourth, fifth, and later centuries freely tampered with the text, in the happily fruitless attempt to get rid of this meaning. They endeavoured, by putting the word in the plural or by omitting "wife," to suggest that the women whom the apostles travelled with were "deaconesses." Augustine, Tertullian, Ambrose, and others explain the verse of "ministering women" (<a href="../../par/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2, 3</a>). The false interpretation avenged itself on the bias which led to it. Valla adopts the wilful invention that the apostles, though married, travelled with their wives only as sisters. Such subterfuges have eaten away the heart of honest exegesis from many passages of Scripture, and originated the taunt that it is a "nose of wax," which readers can twist as they like. It was the cause of such shameful abuses and misrepresentations that at last the practice of travelling about with unmarried women, who went under the name of "sisters," "beloved," "companions," was distinctly forbidden by the third canon of the first Council of Nice. Simon Magus might unblushingly carry about with him a Tyrian woman named Helena; but apostles and true Christians would never have been guilty of any conduct which could give a handle to base suspicions. They travelled only with their wives. <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">sister.</span> A Christian woman (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">A wife</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a wife. <span class="cmt_word">Other apostles.</span> This is a positive mistranslation for "<span class="accented">the rest of the</span> apostles." It might be too much to infer positively from this that <span class="accented">every one</span> of the apostles and desposyni were married; but there is independent evidence and tradition to show that at any rate most of them were. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren of the Lord.</span> They are clearly and undeniably <span class="accented">distinguished from</span> the apostles. According to the Helvidian theory (to which the plain language of the Gospels seems to point), they were sons of Joseph and Mary. This is the view of St. Clement of Alexandria in ancient times, and writers so different from each other as De Wette, Neander, Osiander, Meyer, Ewald, and Alford, in modern. The theory of Jerome, that they were cousins of Jesus, being sons of Alphseus and Mary, a sister of the Virgin, is on every ground absolutely untenable, and it was half dropped even by St. Jerome himself, when it had served his controversial purpose. The theory of Epiphanius, that they were sons of Joseph by a previous marriage, is possible, but incapable of proof. It comes from a tainted source - the apocryphal Gospels (see my 'Early Days of Christianity,' 2). <span class="cmt_word">Cephas</span>. St. Paul also uses the Aramaic name in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>. Peter's wife is mentioned in <a href="../../par/matthew/8-14.htm">Matthew 8:14</a> and in the tradition of her martyrdom (Clem. Alex., 'Strom.,' 7. &sect; 63).

He seems to have continued in his separate mission work the practice of independence which he had learnt from St. Paul. This allusion is interesting, because it is the last time that the name of Barnabas occurs, and it shows that, even after the quarrel and separation, Paul regarded him with love and esteem. <span class="cmt_word">To forbear working.</span> To give up the manual labour by which we maintain ourselves without any expense to the Churches (<a href="../../par/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9</a>). If, then, St. Paul toiled at the dull, mechanical, despised, and ill paid work of tent making, he did so, not because it was, in the abstract, his duty to earn his own living, but because he chose to be nobly independent, that the absolute disinterestedness of his motives might be manifest to all the world. For this reason even when he was most in need he would never receive assistance from any Church except that of Philippi, where he had at least one wealthy convert, and where he was beloved with a peculiar warmth of affection.

If St. Paul had failed to perceive this truth, he must have learnt it at least from <a href="../../par/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>.

It is, however, a tendency of all Semitic idiom verbally to <span class="accented">exclude</span> or <span class="accented">negative</span> the inferior alternative. St. Paul did not intend to say, "God has no care for oxen;" for he knew that "his tender mercies are over all his works:" he only meant in Semitic fashion to say that the precept was much more important in its human application; and herein he consciously or unconsciously adopts the tone of Philo's comment on the same passage ('De Victim Offerentibus,' &sect; 1), that, for present purposes, oxen might be left out of account. The rabbinic Midrash, which gave this turn to the passage, was happier and wiser than most specimens of their exegesis. St. Paul sets the typico allegorical interpretation above the literal in this instance (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>), because he regards it as the more important. It is a specimen of the common Jewish exegetic method of <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> or <span class="accented">minori ad magus.</span> Luther's curious comment is: "God cares for all things; but he does not care that anything should be <span class="accented">written</span> for oxen, because they cannot <span class="accented">read"!</span>

It may be said that this was a ground of boasting, not a reward.

There is no need to adopt the construction suggested by Meyer: "What is my reward? [none] that I may preach gratuitously;" or that of Afford, who finds the reward in the next verse.

It should be carefully observed that St. Paul is here describing the innocent concessions and compliances which arise from the harmless and generous condescension of a loving spirit. He never sank into the fear of man, which made Peter at Antioch unfaithful to his real principles. He did not allow men to form from his conduct any mistaken inference as to his essential views. He waived his personal predilections in matters of indifference which only affected "the infinitely little."

St, Paul tried to look at every subject, so far as he could do so innocently, from 'their point of view (<a href="../../par/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.). He defended their gospel liberty, and had intercourse with Gentile converts on terms of perfect equality (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not without law to God.</span> Not even "without law" (<span class="accented">anomos</span>) Much less "opposed to law" (<span class="accented">antiheroes</span>), though free from it as a bondage (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>). The need for this qualification is shown by the fact that in the Clementine writings, in the spurious letter of Peter to James, St. Paul is surreptitiously calumniated as <span class="accented">"the lawless one</span>." Even the Gentiles were "not without law to God" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14, 15</a>). So that St. Paul is here using language which base opponents might distort, but which the common sense of honest readers would prevent them from misinterpreting.

This condescension laid him open to the malicious attacks of religious enemies (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). But not on that account would St. Paul ever be led to abandon the fruitful aid of that universal sympathy and tolerance which is one of the best tests of Christian love. <span class="cmt_word">That I might by all means save some.</span> He adds this explanation of the motive of his condescension to various scruples <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) lest any should accuse him of men pleasing, as some of his Galatian opponents had done (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).

The only other place in the New Testament where the word occurs is <a href="../../par/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a>, where it seems (on the lips of the unjust judge) to have a sort of slang sense.

No candidate could compete without a preliminary scrutiny, and to be "rejected" was regarded as a deadly insult The word "rejected," "reprobate" - here rendered "a castaway" - is a metaphor derived from the testing of metals, and the casting aside of those which are spurious.
