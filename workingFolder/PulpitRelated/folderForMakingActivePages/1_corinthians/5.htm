The news had come to him "from those of Chloe's household." But St. Paul was not acting on mere "report." The Greek phrase <span class="accented">implies</span>, "It is notorious that there is uncleanness among you." St. Paul must have felt it to be a bad feature in the character of the Corinthian Church that they had not mentioned this gross scandal in their letter. <span class="cmt_word">Commonly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">actually</span> or <span class="accented">absolutely</span>; Elsewhere in the New Testament the worn only occurs in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-24.htm">Matthew 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>. Tertullian renders it "in totum." St. Paul has no need in this instance to name his informants. Every one knew of this scandal. <span class="cmt_word">Fornication</span>; a general word for all kinds of impurity. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>. The word involves an indignant climax, "Yes, and uncleanness of such a kind that," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Is not so much as named.</span> The true reading is, <span class="accented">does not even exist.</span> This form of incest was, indeed, "named" among the Gentiles, for it forms the basis of the story of Hippolytus, the scene of which was in the neighbourhood of Corinth; but the feelings even of pagans were so shocked by it that Cicero alludes to such a crime in the words, "Oh, incredible wickedness, and except in this woman's case - unheard of in all experience!" ('Pro Cluent.,' 5). At this very epoch Nero deepened the general execration against himself by the generally accepted suspicion that he had been guilty of a yet more flagrant crime. <span class="cmt_word">Should have;</span> rather, that <span class="accented">a certain person has his father's wife.</span> Apparently this was some nominal Christian, who was living in open sin with his stepmother, and thereby braving the curse of <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>. We gather from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-12.htm">2 Corinthians 7:12</a> that the father was living, and had also joined the Christian community. From the complete silence as to the crime of the woman, it must be inferred that she was a heathen. Whether she had been divorced or not does not appear, nor whether the offender was nominally married to her or not. <span class="cmt_word">His father's wife.</span> He might have used the one Greek word for stepmother (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>), but the periphrasis might remind some of the heinousness of the sin, and of <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye are puffed up;</span> perhaps rather, <span class="accented">And have</span> ye <span class="accented">been puffed up?</span> The "ye," being expressed m the Greek, is emphatic - "ye, the very persons whose horror ought to have been most intense." It might seem inconceivable that any community calling itself Christian would fall so low as to be puffed up at the existence of such an offence among them. There is, indeed, a subtle and close connection between arrogance and sensuality, and beth are sometimes fatally linked to the conceit of religious knowledge without the reality. But not even a heathen community could have been "puffed up" on such grounds. Yet the Corinthians may have been "puffed up" with the conceited reasons which induced them to leave the offence unrebuked, because they boasted the possession of some spurious "knowledge." Perhaps they bad seized some deadly notion of antinomian liberty, such as has existed at times among Gnostic sects, like the Ophites in ancient and the Anabaptists in modern days. Perhaps they sheltered themselves under the arrogant Jewish rule that all a man's conditions of life were altered by becoming a proselyte - that old relationships were for him entirely abolished; for the Jews held that a prosolyte was like "a newborn child," and had begun life a second time (Bechoroth, f. 47, 1), and might marry any of his relatives. Such miserable sophisms would acquire fresh force from the universal impurity with which Corinthian society was stained, and which rendered it necessary for St. Paul in these Epistles to utter his most solemn warnings against every kind of sensuality (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15-18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>:83, 34; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, etc.). But besides all this, St. Paul's remark does not necessarily mean that their "inflation" was exclusively connected with Gnostic excesses, which bore on the case of this offender. It may mean, "Here is a gross fault in the midst of you, and yet - not <span class="accented">propter</span> <span class="accented">hoc</span>, but <span class="accented">cum hoc</span> - the characteristic of your religious factions is pride and conceit." This was indeed <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to play the Corinthian," in the worst sense, of that proverbial taunt. Possibly the prominence or wealth of the offender may have led to a more easy condonation of his crime. Exculpatory sophism may have been suggested by self interest. <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in order that, as a result of your godly sorrow, the offender might be removed from your midst. <span class="cmt_word">He that hath done this deed.</span> The language of St. Paul, as always, is as delicate as clearness would allow. The fact that the verb is in the past aorist may perhaps allow us to <span class="accented">hope</span> that the offence, at any rate in its most aggravated forms, had ceased to be committed. The manner of the crime ("in such a way") seems to have been an aggravation of the crime itself. In this indignant verse we have, as Stanley says, "the burst of the storm, the mutterings of which had been heard in the earlier chapters." So intense was the effect produced by St. Paul's stern severity, that a great part of the Second Epistle had to be devoted to allaying the agitation which these words had excited (see especially <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <i>concerning</i> him that hath so done this deed,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I verily</span>. The broken structure of the verse shows the deep emotion with which it was penned - as it were with sobs. St. Paul contrasts the line which he means to take with the lax condonation granted by the Corinthian Church. <span class="cmt_word">As absent;</span> rather, <span class="accented">being absent</span> or <span class="accented">though absent.</span> The <span class="accented">as</span> is omitted in the best manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">But present in spirit;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the spirit</span>;' but he is referring to his own spirit: "Bodily I am absent; but speaking as though my spirit were present in your assembly [comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a>], I have already judged," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Have judged already</span>. My decision was instantaneous and is final. <span class="cmt_word">As though I were present.</span> My sentence is as clear as though I were at this moment standing in the midst of you. <span class="cmt_word">That hath so done.</span> The verb is not as before, <span class="accented">poiesas</span>, but <span class="accented">katergasamenon</span>, which is stronger, "the <span class="accented">perpetrator</span> of this deed." The "so" means "with all these circumstances of aggravation." The same verb is used in <a href="../../par/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>. The broken periods of the Greek reflect the emotion of the writer. The passage is as it were written with sobs (Wordsworth). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of our Lord Jesus</span> Christ. The word "Christ" is probably <span class="cmt_word">an</span> addition. The clause may either be taken with "when ye are gathered together," or with "to deliver" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the power of our Lord Jesus.</span> Each clause adds solemnity to the scene in which St. Paul imagines himself as standing with them in the spirit, and joining with the assembly of the Church, and armed with the authority of Christ, while he pronounces on the offender the sentence on which he had already determined. That he could claim "the power of the Lord" resulted from his possession of the Holy Spirit. and the special commission to bind and to loose, to remit and to retain, on earth, which Christ had entrusted to the apostles (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To deliver such a one unto Satan.</span> Scripture nowhere defines the character and limits of such a sentence as this. By cutting off an offender from Church communion (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14, 15</a>), that is, from all the visible means of grace, he was for the time separated from spiritual influences, and was, therefore, so far handed over to Satan. The phrase is also applied to Hymenaeus and Alexander, in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>. It is very doubtful whether it was necessarily meant to involve such physical inflictions as fell on Ananias, Sapphira, or Elymas. It is, however, important to observe that the intention of the sentence, like the true intention of excommunication, when exercised in a right spirit (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1, &sect; 13), was not wrathful, but merciful. It was, as Calvin says, "medicinale remedium" - "not for destruction, but for edification" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>). Hymenaeus and Alexander were handed to Satan, not for their final ruin and damnation, but with a kind and remedial purpose, "that they may learn not to blaspheme" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>), and this offender with the express object ', that his spirit may be saved." Had these facts been more deeply studied, there would have been a very different tone and spirit in many of the mediaeval anathemas. <span class="accented">Such a one</span> (setup. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>). He seems to hold aloof from the man's very name. So "such as she" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) is used of the adulteress in <a href="../../par/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For the destruction of the flesh;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that all <span class="accented">carnal influences</span> in him might be destroyed. It is not his "body" which is to be destroyed, but the , "flesh," the <span class="accented">jetzer hara</span>, or "evil impulse," as the Jews called it. When this was destroyed, the body might once more become a temple of the Holy Ghost. <span class="cmt_word">That the spirit may be saved.</span> The destruction of the lowest element of our human nature is the salvation of the highest; it is the cutting away of the dead corpse from the living soul. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the Lord;</span> when the Lord should judge the quick and the dead. The merciful intention of St. Paul is clearly developed in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-6.htm">2 Corinthians 2:6-11</a>. He looked on God's judgments as <span class="accented">remedial</span>, not as solely retributive (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-29.htm">1 Corinthians 11:29-32</a>). Here, as Chrysostom finely says, the apostle lays down, as it were, his laws to the devil, telling him how far, and how far <span class="accented">only</span>, he can proceed. The object of excommunication is to save the offender, and not to do the devil's work by ensuring his eternal ruin. We can imagine how awful would be the solemnity of these words when they were first read aloud to the little Christian communities of Corinth. It was natural that they should produce an overwhelming excitement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">Your glorying <i>is</i> not good.

The Greek word is not <span class="accented">agathon</span>, but <span class="accented">kalon</span>, an almost untranslatable word, which implies all moral beauty, and resembles the English word "fair" or "noble." When he says that it is "not good," he uses the figure called <span class="accented">litotes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he employs an expression intentionally too weak, that it may be corrected into a stronger one by the involuntary indignation of the reader; as when Virgil calls the cannibal tyrant Busiris "unpraised." Hence the clause is equivalent to "the thing of which you are boasting is detestable." <span class="cmt_word">Know ye not.</span> This clause is used by St. Paul in specially solemn appeals, and almost exclusively in these Epistles (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>). The taint alluded to is not only the presence of the unpunished offender, but the general laxity and impurity displayed by their whole bearing in the matter (comp. the line of Menander quoted in ch. 15:33, and the "root of bitterness" in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>). (For the word "lump," see <a href="../../par/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16</a>.)  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Purge out therefore.</span> The word "therefore" is absent from the best manuscripts, and the abruptness is more emphatic without it. No doubt the metaphor was suggested by the fact that St. Paul was writing about the time of the Passover (<a href="../../par/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8</a>). The most essential requisite of the Jewish regulations, with which his whole training had made him so familiar, was the absolute putting away, and even destruction, of every trace of leaven, which was diligently sought for the day before the Passover began. The putting away of leaven was a type of sanctification. <span class="cmt_word">The old leaven</span>. "Old" as belonging to their unregenerate and unconverted condition; a remnant of the day when they had been Gentiles and Jews who had not known Christ. The least <span class="accented">willing</span> tolerance of the taint would cause it to work throughout the whole society. <span class="cmt_word">As ye are unleavened.</span> Leaven is the type of evil in its secret and corrupting workings. Ideally, Christians can only be addressed as "unleavened," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as "purged from their own old sins" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-9.htm">2 Peter 1:9</a>); and it is the method of Scripture (indeed, it is the only possible method) to address Christians as being Christians <span class="accented">indeed</span>, and therefore in their <span class="accented">ideal</span> rather than their actual character. Some have taken these words to mean, "You are actually keeping the Passover, and therefore have no leaven among you;" but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words cannot bear this meaning; nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> was St. Paul likely to appeal so prominently to a Jewish ordinance; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he is thinking of the Christian Easter, and only borrowing a casual illustration from the Jewish Passover. <span class="cmt_word">For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;</span> rather, in the true reading, for our <span class="accented">passover also was sacrificed - even Christ.</span> As Christians, the Gentile Corinthians certainly did not keep the Jewish Passover; but St. Paul reminds them that they too had a Passover - that for them, too a Paschal Victim had been offered, whose sacrificial blood had been shed for their redemption (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).

For now ye are "in Christ," and, therefore, are a "new creation."

The beautiful Greek word for "sincerity" means freedom from all admixture. It is, perhaps, derived from "testing in the sunshine," and is used by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>.

The attempt to get rid of so plain a statement, in the supposed interests of some superstitious notion that every line which an apostle wrote to a Church must necessarily have been inspired and infallible, is at once unscriptural and grossly superstitious. The notion that "the Epistle" intended is <span class="accented">this</span> Epistle is an absurdity invented in the interests of the same fiction.

So, unless we suppose that the expression has slipped in involuntarily, we must here give the word a metaphorical sense, as in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>. We must else be driven to suppose that there were some half and half Christians, like Constantine, who "feared the Lord, and served their own gods" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For then must ye needs go out of the world;</span> <span class="accented">for in that case</span> (as they had perhaps implied in their letter of questions to St. Paul) <span class="accented">ye would have been morally bound to leave the world altogether</span> and seek a new one. The Greek particle <span class="accented">ara</span> perhaps refers to the astonishment caused by their misapprehension of St. Paul's rule. The clause throws painful light on the condition of the heathen world. If all communication with "fornicators" was to be forbidden, the sin was so universal, especially at Corinth, that all intercourse with Gentiles would have be. come impossible. Even some who professed to be stern moralists among the heathen, like Cato and Cicero, looked on the sin as being, at the worst, quite venial, and even, under certain circumstances, commendable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now I have written unto you.</span> The tense used is, perhaps, the epistolary aorist, and is therefore equivalent to "but now I write to you;" otherwise the sense is, "but what I <span class="accented">meant</span> in my letter was," etc. The position of the words rather favours this view. St. Paul expressly tells them in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a> that he never intended to forbid all intercourse with heathens. They were not to be "taken out of the world," but to be free from evil (<a href="../../par/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any man that is called a brother.</span> The word "brother" was used before the name "Christian" was accepted by the members of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Or an idolater</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7, 14</a>). He might call himself a Christian, and yet be in reality an idolater (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With such a one no not to eat</span>. If the phrase be pressed, it would involve exclusion from all privileges of the body, for the Holy Communion was celebrated in connection with the <span class="accented">agapae.</span> But the general meaning is that of <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, "We command you... that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?</span> To pass sentence on heathens is no concern of mine; it is no part of my office. The phrase "them that are without" was originally a Jewish phrase. To the Jews all men were outsiders (<span class="accented">chitsonin</span>) except themselves. The phrase was adopted by Christians, but in a less contemptuous sense (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>). We find a description of "those that were without" - "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise" - in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Do not ye judge them that are within!</span> An appeal to their own practice and to common sense. Christian rules can, of course, only apply to Christian communities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God judgeth.</span> To that "judgment of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>) Christians must leave them. They have no jurisdiction over them. The mention of "judging" forms a natural transition to the next chapter. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. The word is omitted in the best manuscripts. The command is more abruptly forcible without it. <span class="cmt_word">Put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</span> The command would come the more powerfully because it is a direct reference to the language of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-7.htm">Deuteronomy 24:7</a>. The explanation, "Put away the evil one [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the devil] from among you!" is adopted by Calvin, but is too general. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_corinthians/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Corinthians 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_corinthians/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Corinthians 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
