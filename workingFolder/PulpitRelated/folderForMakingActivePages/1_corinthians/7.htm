It is <span class="cmt_word">good for a man not to touch a woman.</span> The word used is not <span class="accented">agathon</span>, good, but <span class="accented">kalon</span>, fair; "an excellent thing." In ver. 26 he limits the word by the clause, "good <span class="accented">for the present necessity."</span> There is no limitation here, and it is probable that St. Paul is quoting the actual words of the letter which he had received from Corinth. There had sprung up among them some antinomians, who, perhaps by perverting his own teaching or that of Apollos, had made liberty a cloak of lasciviousness. In indignant reaction against such laxity, others, perhaps, with Essene proclivities, had been led to disparage matrimony as involving an inevitable stain. Gnosticism, and the spirit which led to it, oscillated between the two extremes of asceticism and uncleanness. Both extremes were grounded on the assertion that matter is inherently evil. Ascetic Gnostics, therefore, strove to destroy by severity every carnal impulse; antinomian Gnostics argued that the life of the spirit was so utterly independent of the flesh that what the flesh did was of no consequence. We find the <span class="accented">germs</span> of Gnostic heresy long before the name appeared. Theoretically, St. Paul inclines to the ascetic view, not in the abstract, but in view of the near advent of Christ, and of the cares, distractions, and even trials which marriage involved in days of struggle and persecution. Yet his wisdom is shown in the cautious moderation with which he expresses himself. The tone of the letter written by Gregory the Great to Augustine with reference to similar inquiries about Saxon converts is very different. The example of St. Paul should have shown the mediaeval moralists and even the later Fathers how wrong it is "to give themselves airs of certainty on points where certainty is not to be had." <span class="accented">Not to touch a woman.</span> St. Paul means generally "not to marry" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a> [LXX.]). Celibacy under the then existing conditions of the Christian world is, he admits, in itself an honourable and morally salutary thing, though, for the majority, marriage may be a positive duty. He is not dreaming of the <span class="accented">nominal</span> marriages of mediaeval ascetics, for he assumes and directs that all who marry should live in conjugal union. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless, <i>to avoid</i> fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span>. In this single word St. Paul practically refutes all the dangerous and unwarrantable inferences drawn by St. Jerome and others from the previous clause. St. Jerome argues: "If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, it must be bad to do so, and therefore celibacy is a holier state than marriage." He also says, "I suspect the goodness of a thing which the greatness of another evil enforces as a lesser evil." Such reasoning shows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The danger of pressing words to the full extent of the logical inferences which may be deduced from them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The errors which always arise from arguing upon isolated texts dissevered from their context, and from all consideration of the circumstances under which they were written. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The necessity of following the guidance of the Holy Spirit when he shows, by history and experience, the need for altering precepts with reference to altered conditions. There is in celibacy a moral beauty - it is <span class="accented">kalon</span>; there are cases in which it becomes a duty. But in most cases marriage, being no less a duty, as St. Paul proceeds to show, is even fairer and more excellent. Neither state, the wedded or the unwedded, is in itself more holy than the other. Each has its own honour and loveliness, and can only be judged of in connection with surrounding circumstances. Those who make St. Paul judge slightingly of marriage contradict his own express rules and statements (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a>), and make him speak the current heathen language of heathen epicures, who, to the great injury of morals, treated marriage as a disagreeable necessity, which was, if possible, to be avoided. If the "it is a good thing" of St. Paul in ver. 1 were to be taken absolutely, it would have to be corrected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the example of Christ, who beautified with his presence the marriage at Cana (<a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1, 2</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the primeval law which said, "It is not good for man to be alone" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the fact that marriage is the chosen analogue of the relation between Christ and his Church. But the very phrase he uses, as will be seen by reference to <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>, etc., is a <span class="accented">relative</span> not an <span class="accented">absolute</span> one, and St. Paul uses it here concessively, but with the object of pointing out limitations which almost reversed it. To avoid <span class="cmt_word">fornication</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because o f fornication</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the many forms of impurity which were current every where, but especially at Corinth. Some have argued that St. Paul takes a "low" and "poor" view of marriage by regarding it only in the light of a remedy against fornication. The answer is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the reason which he assigns is a true reason in itself, and with reference to the masses of mankind; for which reason it is adopted by our Church in her Marriage Service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He is addressing those who were living in a corrupt and semi-heathen atmosphere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He is not here speaking of the idealized and spiritual aspect of marriage, but only of large practical necessities. When he speaks of marriage as a high Christian mystery (as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>), he adopts a very different tone. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">every man have.</span> A rule, not a mere permission. He here implies the truth that married love bears no analogy whatever to the <span class="accented">vagae libidines</span> of those who live like "natural brute beasts." In marriage the sensuous impulse, by being controlled and placed under religious sanctions is refined and purified from a degradation into a sacrament. Instead of being any longer the source of untold curses to mankind, it becomes the condition of their continuance and an element in their peace, because it is then placed under the blessing of God and of his Church.

Temporary separation for special reasons had been recognized from the earliest times (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye may give yourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">ye may have leisure.</span> The verb is in the aorist, which shows that the "leisure" contemplated was for brief periods, not during continuous years. It was altered to the <span class="accented">present</span> by the officious copyists, who believed in external and mechanical rules of holiness. <span class="cmt_word">To fasting and prayer.</span> "Fasting" is an ascetic interpolation, not found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, D, F. On this interpolation, and perhaps on the analogy of the rule given by Moses at Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>), rose the practice of married persons living apart at Lent (Stanley). <span class="cmt_word">Come together again.</span> The prepossessions of ascetic scribes have again tampered with the text. The true reading is, "be together again" (<span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), not "come together" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For your incontinency;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because of.</span> Their past lives and their present temptations were a warning that they could not lay on themselves burdens which God did not require.

He means to say that he leaves the <span class="accented">details</span> of their lives, whether celibate or married, to their individual consciences, though with large hearted wisdom and charity he would emancipate them from human and unauthorized restrictions. The clause is not, therefore, a parallel to the restrictions on the authority of his utterances, such as we find in vers. 12, 29, 40, and in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>.

In <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a> he lays down and justifies the same rule with reference to young widows. <span class="cmt_word">It is better to marry than to burn.</span> The original tenses give greater force and beauty to this obvious rule of Christian common sense and morality. The "marry" is in the aorist - "to marry once for all," and live in holy married union; the "burn" is in the present - "to be on fire with concupiscence." Marriage once for all is better than continuous lust; the former is permitted, the latter sinful.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-18.htm">1 Corinthians 7:18</a></div><div class="verse">Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being circumcised.</span> The first instance he gives is that of Judaism and paganism. The circumcised Jew is to remain circumcised; the uncircumcised Gentile is not to undergo circumcision. <span class="cmt_word">Become uncircumcised.</span> The Hellenising Jews in the days of the priest Menelaus (1 Macc. 1:15; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:05, 1) had discovered a process for obliterating the appearance of circumcision; such persons were known as <span class="accented">masochim.</span> St. Paul does not permit the adoption of this course. In the rebellion of Barcocheba many obliterated the sign of circumcision, and were afterwards, at great danger to themselves, recircumcised. ('Yevamoth,' tel. 72, 1). <span class="cmt_word">Let him not be circumcised.</span> This rule was of much more practical significance than the other. The early fortunes of Christianity had been almost shipwrecked by the attempt of Jewish rigorists to enforce this odious bondage on the Gentiles, and their deliverance flora it had been due almost solely to St. Paul. It was his inspired insight which had swayed the decision of the synod at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.); and at a later period his Epistle to the Galatians was the manifesto of Gentile emancipation. He proved that after Christ's death "circumcision" (<span class="accented">peritome</span>) became to Gentiles a mere physical mutilation (<span class="accented">katatome</span>) (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a></div><div class="verse">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Circumcision is nothing.</span> The Jews regarded it as everything; and to make this assertion at so early an epoch of Christian history, required all the courage of St. Paul, and proved his grand originality. He was the first to prove to the Jews that circumcision had become a thing intrinsically indifferent, which might, under some circumstances, be desirable (as in the case of Timothy), but could never be reckoned among essentials. <span class="cmt_word">And uncircumcision is nothing.</span> The same sentence occurs three times in St. Paul, summing up, as it were, the liberty which it had cost him endless peril and anguish to achieve. Each time he concludes it with a weighty clause to show what <span class="accented">is everything:</span> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (ver. 19); "... but <span class="accented">faith which worketh by love"</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>); "... but <span class="accented">a new creation"</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the keeping of the commandments.</span> So St. John says, "Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."

One who was converted whilst he was a slave is not to strive over anxiously for freedom. The word "emancipation" sometimes seems (as in the letter to Philemon) to be "trembling on Paul's lips," but he never utters it, because to do so would have been to kindle social revolt, and lead to the total overthrow of Christianity at the very commencement of its career. Our Lord had taught the apostles to adapt means to ends; and the method of Christianity was to inculcate great principles, the acceptance of which involved, with all the certainty of a law, the ultimate regeneration of the world. Christianity came into the world as the dawn, not as the noon - a shining light, which brightened more and more unto the perfect day. <span class="cmt_word">Care not for it.</span> Do not be troubled by the fact, because in Christ "there is neither bond nor free" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), and because earthly freedom is as nothing in comparison with the freedom which Christ gives (<a href="../../par/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</span> The words may mean, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "use freedom" - avail yourself of the opportunity of emancipation; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "use slavery" - be content to remain a slave. In favour of the first interpretation is the fact that there is nothing extravagant or fantastic in Christian morality; and that, considering what ancient slavery was - how terrible its miseries, how shameful and perilously full of temptations were its conditions - it sounds unnatural to advise a Christian slave to remain a slave when he might gain his freedom. Yet the other interpretation, <span class="accented">remain a slave by preference</span>, seems to be required: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By the strict interpretation of the Greek particles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> By the entire context, which turns on the rule that each man should stay in the earthly condition in which he first received God's call. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> By the fact that even the Stoic moralists - like Epictetus, who was himself a slave - gave similar advice (Epict., 'Dissert.,' 3:26; 'Enchir.,' 10:32.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> By the indifference which St. Paul felt and expressed towards mere earthly conditions (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), as things of no real significance (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> By his appeal to the nearness of the day of Christ (vers. 29-31). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> By the preponderance of high authorities - Chrysostom, Theodoret, Luther, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, Alford, etc. - in favour of this view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> By its parallelism to the advice given to Christian slaves in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>, where they are urged to serve Christian masters all the more zealously because they were brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> Lastly, all the apparent harshness of the advice is removed when we remember that St. Paul was probably thinking only of <span class="accented">the Christian slaves of Christian masters</span>, between whom the relation might be as happy as that of Philemon to the forgiven Onesimus.

They knew that the bondage of Satan was so crushing that mere earthly bondage was, in comparison, as nothing; and that the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, though it might seem to take the form of service, was the sole perfect freedom. The freedmen of sin are the most hopeless slaves; the servants of God alone are free (see <a href="../../par/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>).

Common experience shows that in days of "trouble and rebuke and blasphemy" the cares and anxieties of those who have to bear the burden of many besides themselves, and those dearer to them than their own selves, are far the most trying. Perhaps St. Paul was thinking of the "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days," of our Lord (<a href="../../par/luke/21-23.htm">Luke 21:23</a>). But I spare you.

It only applies absolutely to times in which the conditions are the same as they then were. The "anxious cares" which marriage involves may be more innocent and less distracting than those which attack the celibate condition; and when that is the case, marriage, on St. Paul's own principle, becomes a duty. Thus some of the best and greatest of our missionaries have found their usefulness as God's messengers vastly increased by marriage, in spite of the awful trials which marriage often involves. The apostles and brethren of the Lord felt the same. St. Paul's opinions here are, as he tells us, <span class="accented">opinions only</span>, and admit of many modifications. Advice given to men and women when Christians believed that the Lord was coming, perhaps in that very age, to judge the world, is not universally applicable to all ages. In St. Paul's later Epistles he does not revert to this advice, but assumes that marriage is the normal condition.

The spirit of St. Paul's advice - the avoidance of distraction, and the determination that our duty to God shall not be impaired by earthly relationships - remains eternally significant. Another common way of punctuating the words is, "The married man cares.., how he may please his wife, <span class="accented">and is divided</span> [in interests]."

It is quite clear that, if these words are meant to disparage matrimony in comparison with celibacy, or to treat celibacy in the abstract as a holier state that marriage, they have been set aside by the universal practice and theory of the Christian world. But, as we have seen, they are expressed by St. Paul only as a relative and diffident opinion. It is remarkable that not one word is said as to the choice of the virgin herself in the matter, which is one of the most essential points on which the decision must turn. St. Paul, no doubt, assumes the acquiescence or preference of the maiden as one of the elements in the absence of any "need" for her marriage; but also he writes after lifelong familiarity with the all but absolute control exercised by Jewish parents over their youthful daughters.
