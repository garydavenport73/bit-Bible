Probably it is this word, not found in the original, which has given rise to the perplexing, unhistoric, and unwarranted theory that "the gift of tongues" was a power of speaking in foreign languages. <span class="cmt_word">Speaketh not unto men</span>. Because, as a rule, no one understands anything that he says. The word literally means "hears." It may, perhaps, imply that no special attention was given to those who gave way to these impulses of utterance. The whole of this chapter proves in a most striking way the close analogy between "the tongue" and the impassioned soliloquies of inarticulate utterance which were poured forth in tones of thrilling power among the Montanists, and in modern times among the Irvingites. <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit.</span> It is uncertain whether this means "in his own spirit," or "in the Spirit of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a result of inspiration. Probably the former (<a href="../../par/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, etc.). Perhaps, however, the two imply the same thing. The spirit is the one Divine part of our human being, and when a man is a true Christian his spirit is in union with, is as it were lost in, the Spirit of God. St. Paul recognizes the true tongue - for it might be <span class="accented">simulated</span> by hysteria and even by mere physical imposture - as a result of inspiration, that is, of the overpowering dominance of the human spirit by a supernatural power. Nevertheless, he points out the extreme peril of yielding to or self inducing these emotions public, or in leaving them uncontrolled. <span class="cmt_word">Mysteries.</span> Secrets revealed possibly to him, but unrevealed by this strange "tongue" to others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a></div><div class="verse">But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men <i>to</i> edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - To <span class="cmt_word">edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</span> The "to" should be omitted. His words build up the Christian soul, by rousing its efforts and consoling its sorrows. The "Son of prophecy" (Barnabas) is, as Stanley points out, also "a Son of consolation" (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>). "Support" (<span class="accented">paraklesis</span>) involves "comfort," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> strength and calm.

Those who have experienced the emotion describe this very result. They felt enlarged and elevated - their whole being was for a time expanded - by this emotion. <span class="cmt_word">The Church</span>.

Yet it is perfectly intelligible. Montanus truly said that each human spirit is like a harp, which the Holy Spirit strikes as with a <span class="accented">plectrum</span>, and which yields itself to the mighty hand by which the chords are swept. We have seen all along - and history has in various ages confirmed the impression, on every occasion when these phenomena have been reproduced in seasons of great spiritual revival - that the external <span class="accented">symptoms</span> may be imitated with most dangerous and objectionable results both to the speaker and to others. But when the expression is <span class="accented">genuine</span>, the fact that the tides of the Spirit can thus sweep through the narrow channels of individuality is in itself a sign that the spirit of the man is alive and not dead; and thus he is an evidence of God's power both to himself and to others. Those who have heard "the tongue" have told me that its force, melody, and penetrative quality produced an impression not to be forgotten. When we see the stuffed and stopped-up hearts and lives of thousands of frivolous and worldly money worshippers, we might well echo St. Paul's wish. <span class="cmt_word">Greater</span>. Not of necessity greater absolutely or morally, but greater in the fact of his wider and deeper usefulness. <span class="cmt_word">Except he interpret.</span> From this we infer that sometimes, when the passion had spent its force, the speaker in the tongue could give rational explanation of the thoughts and feelings to which he had given ecstatic utterance.

In the original, therefore, there is not the least allusion to any phenomenon resembling the "gift of tongues." But the mere <span class="accented">words</span> of a scriptural passage always came to Jews with all the force of an argument, independently of their primary meaning; and it was enough for St. Paul's purpose that in Isaiah the allusion is to unintelligible utterance, and to the fact that the teaching which it was meant to convey would be in vain.

It is easy to see that the style and method of worship in the assemblies of Christians at this early epoch resembled that now prevalent among Quakers. The teaching was not left to recognized pastors, but any Christian might speak who had gifts which moved him to address his brethren. The externals of worship are of no eternal signifiance, but are best left to be moulded by the requirements of time and place, with reference to the teachings of past experience. No doubt St. Paul's depreciation of glossolaly led to its rapid disappearance when it had done its work of being "a sign to unbelievers." But if ancient modes of worship were too independent of rigid conditions, modern modes are, on the other hand, too stereotyped and inelastic.

This rule alone tended to extinguish the disorderly exhibition of" tongues." To control the passion which leads to it is, sooner or later, to stop the manifestation - a result which St. Paul would probably have been the last to regret, when its purpose had been accomplished.

St. Paul is not encouraging the Corinthians to the consoriousness of conceited and incompetent criticism, but only putting them on their guard against implicit acceptance of all they hear; which was a very necessary caution at a place where so many teachers sprang up.

The articles are better omitted: "Spirits of prophets are under the control of prophets." Mantic inspirations, the violent possession which threw sibyls and priestesses into contortions - the foaming lip and streaming hair and glazed or glaring eye - have no place in the self-controlling dignity of Christian inspiration. Even <span class="accented">Jewish</span> prophets, in the paroxysm of emotion, might lie naked on the ground and rave (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>); but the genuine inspiration in Christian ages never obliterates the self consciousness or overpowers the reason; It abhors the hysteria and simulation and frenzy which have sometimes disgraced revivalism and filled lunatic asylums.

The readings vary considerably ("He is ignored;" "He has been ignored;" "He shall be ignored;" "Let him be ignored"). These other readings would be a statement of retribution in kind - of God "sprinkling penal blindnesses on forbidden lusts." But the reading of our translation is on the whole the best supported, and means that to invincible bigotry and ignorant obstinacy St. Paul will have no more to say (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>).

But glossolaly is hardly possible under conditions of order, decorum, and self suppression, and we are not surprised that we hear no more of it in the Church, but only in the wild excitement of fanatical sects. The suppression, however, of the startling manifestation by no means necessarily involves any enfeeblement of the inspiring conviction from which it sprang. The brawling torrent which "foams its madness off" is lost in the calm and majestic flow of the deep river.
