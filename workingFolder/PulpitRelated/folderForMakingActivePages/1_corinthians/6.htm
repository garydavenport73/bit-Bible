When one of the litigants was a heathen, Christians were allowed to go before heathen law courts, because no other remedy was possible. <span class="cmt_word">Go to law before the unjust.</span> The "unjust" is here used for "Gentiles," because it at once suggests a reason against the dereliction of Christian duty involved in such a step. How "unjust" the pagans were in the special sense of the word, the Christians of that day had daily opportunities of seeing; and in a more general sense, the Gentiles were "sinners" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>). Even the Jews were bound to settle their civil disputes before their own tribunals. The ideal Jew was <span class="accented">jashar</span>, or "the upright man," and Jews could not consistently seek integrity from those who were not upright. <span class="accented">A fortiori</span>, Christians ought not to do so. <span class="cmt_word">Before the saints.</span> All Christians were ideally "saints," just as the heathen were normally "unjust." If Christians went to law with one another before the heathen, they belied their profession of mutual love, caused scandal, and were almost necessarily tempted into compliance with heathen customs, even to the extent of recognizing idols. Our Lord had already laid down the rule that "brothers" ought to settle their quarrels among themselves (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not know?</span> The word "or" should be supplied from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, D, F, etc. Bishop Wordsworth points out that this emphatic question occurs ten times in these two Epistles (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2, 3, 9, 15, 16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13, 24</a>), and only twice in all the rest (<a href="../../par/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>). It was a fitting rebuke to those who took for knowledge their obvious ignorance. It resembles the "Have ye not so much as read?" to Pharisees who professed such profound familiarity with the Scriptures. <span class="cmt_word">That the saints shall judge the world</span>. So Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>) had said, "The Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High." Our Lord had confirmed this promise to his apostles, "Ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). Various modes of evading the literal sense have been adopted, but even in the Book of Wisdom we find, "They [the righteous] shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people" (Wisd. 3:8). All speculation as to the manner and extent in which the saints shall share in the work of Christ as Judge of the quick and dead, are obviously futile. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be judged;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is being judged -</span> the present points to the future, as though that which is inevitable is already in course of fulfilment. <span class="cmt_word">To judge the smallest matters;</span> literally, <span class="accented">of the smallest judgments.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That we shall judge angels.</span> Angels, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some who belong, or once did belong, to that class. The statement furnishes no data for further speculation. It can hardly mean "evil spirits," for where the word is entirely unqualified it always means good angels; otherwise we might refer it to the "angels which kept not their first estate" (<a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). It is impossible, and not straightforward, to explain away the word "angels" as meaning Church officials, etc., or to make the word "judge" mean "involve a condemnation of them by comparison with ourselves." All that we can say is that "God chargeth even his angels with folly, and in his sight the very heavens are not clean" (<a href="../../par/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>); and that "to angels hath he not subjected the world to come" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>). We must take the plain meaning of the apostle's words, whether we can throw any light on his conceptions or not. The only alternative is to suppose that the word means "those who <span class="accented">once</span> were good angels," but <span class="accented">are now</span> fallen spirits. It was so understood by Tertullian, Chrysostom, etc. <span class="cmt_word">How much more;</span> rather, to <span class="accented">say nothing of.</span> The accurate rendering of these verses is a matter of some difficulty, but not to an extent which affects the material sense, or which can be explained without a minute knowledge of Greek. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If then ye have,</span> etc. The verse implies that civil disputes might naturally occur among them. What he is here reprobating is their objectionable method of settling them. <span class="cmt_word">Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church.</span> This implies an utter scorn of trivial quarrels about personal rights. Surely the lowliest, the most unregarded members of the Church - those of no account - have wisdom enough to decide in such small matters. Thus when there arose a murmuring between Hebrews and Hellenists about the daily distribution to widows, the apostles, thinking that they had much more important work in hand than the adjustment of such jealousies, left the whole matter in the hands of the seven deacons. Some understand "those held of no account in the Church" to mean heathens; but he is here forbidding them to bring their quarrels before the heathens. Of course, ideally, none ought to be "despised" or "held of no account" in the Church; but St. Paul is here speaking relatively, and with reference to the views of the Corinthians themselves, and not without irony. The perfect participle, "those who have been set at nought," perhaps means persons of proved inferiority of judgment.

Your going to law is an inferiority or deficiency; you ought to know of "a more excellent way." <span class="cmt_word">Why do ye not rather take wrong?</span> Strange as such advice would sound to heathens, who prided themselves on the passionate resentment of injuries as though it were a virtue, this had been the distinct teaching of our Lord; "Resist not evil" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

Are you defying God, or does your sin arise from mere ignorance? <span class="cmt_word">The unrighteous;</span> better, <span class="accented">that wrong doers</span>, the verb being the same as "ye do wrong" in ver. 8. Perhaps the Corinthians thought that they would be saved by the mere fact of having been admitted into God's kingdom (the Christian Church in all its highest privileges) by baptism. St. Paul here lays down, as distinctly as St. James does, that faith without works is dead, and privileges without holiness are abrogated. The spirit of his warning is the same as that of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord...  are these;" or that of St. John the Baptist, "Say not unto yourselves, We be Abraham's sons." Christians have often been liable to the temptation of underrating the peril which results from the falling asunder of action from knowledge. There can be no greater danger than that of talking slightingly of "mere morality." Religion is not an outward service, but a spiritual life manifested by a holy living. <span class="cmt_word">Be not deceived.</span> So our Lord says," Let no man deceive you" (<a href="../../par/mark/13-5.htm">Mark 13:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). St. Paul uses the warning very solemnly again in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, and St. James in <a href="../../par/james/1-16.htm">James 1:16</a>. The self deception of merely verbal orthodoxy is the most dangerous of all. <span class="cmt_word">Neither fornicators</span>. The first four classes of sinners were specially prevalent at Corinth, where, indeed, impurity formed part of the recognized cult of the local Aphrodite (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>). Lists of these "works of the flesh," which were the all but universal curse and stain of heathendom, occur also in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-7</a>.

(For a similar contrast of the change wrought by the Spirit of God, see <a href="../../par/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3-7</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">But ye are washed</span>. The voice and tense in the original differ from those of the following words. This cannot be accidental. It is better, therefore, to render, <span class="accented">But ye washed away your sins</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ye, by your baptism, washed away those stains (<a href="../../par/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The very object of Christ's death had been that he might cleanse his Church "by the washing of water by the Word." <span class="cmt_word">But ye are sanctified, but ye are justified;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but ye were sanctified, but y? were justified</span>, namely, at your conversion. By "sanctified" is meant, not the progressive course of sanctification, but the <span class="accented">consecration</span> to God by baptism (Wickliffe, "halowed"). (For what St. Paul meant by justification, see <a href="../../par/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of the Lord Jesus,</span> etc. This clause and the next belongs to all the three previous verbs. <span class="cmt_word">Of our God.</span> In the word "our" is involved that appeal to Christian unity of which he never loses sight throughout the letter.

By "all things," of course, is only meant "all things which are indifferent in themselves." They erroneously applied this maxim of Christian liberty to that which was inherently sinful, and thus were tempted to "make their liberty a cloak of viciousness." St. Paul, as Bengel observes, often, and especially in this Epistle, uses the first person <span class="accented">generally</span> in gnomic or semi-proverbial sentences (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-11.htm">1 Corinthians 14:11</a>). But. This is St. Paul's correction of too broad a formula. <span class="cmt_word">Are not expedient.</span> St. Paul illustrates this in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8-10</a>. We have no right to do even that which is innocent, if it be disadvantageous to the highest interests of ourselves or others. "He alone," says St. Augustine, "does not fall into unlawful things who sometimes abstains by way of caution even from lawful ones." <span class="cmt_word">Will</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be brought under the power.</span> The play of words in the original might be imitated by saying, "All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any." In other words, "boundless intemperance" may become a tyranny. The pretence of moral freedom may end in a moral bondage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Obedience is better than freedom? What's free?<br />The vexed foam on the wave, the tossed straw on the sea;<br />The ocean itself, as it rages and swells,<br />In the bonds of a boundless obedience dwells."</span> I will be master even over my liberty by keeping it under the beneficent control of law and of charity.

Things Levitically unclean might be essentially pure, and both food and the body which lives thereby are things "which perish in the using" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-22.htm">Colossians 2:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall destroy;</span> <span class="accented">shall bring to nought.</span> This would occur when the physical body becomes a spiritual body, like that of the angels of God (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51, 52</a>).

Food was a necessity, and the stomach was formed for its assimilation. Fornication is not a venial but "a <span class="accented">deadly</span> sin." It is not a natural necessity, but a consuming evil. The body was created for higher ends - namely, to be a temple of God. "God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord for the body.</span> Therefore our members ought to be used "as instruments of righteousness unto God" (<a href="../../par/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>), and our bodies presented as a living, holy, reasonable, acceptable sacrifice to him (<a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).

They make a man his own deadliest enemy. <span class="cmt_word">Every sin... is without the body.</span> Some have supposed that this cannot apply to gluttony and drunkenness, which they therefore class with fornication; but even in those sins, as in suicide, the <span class="accented">cause</span> of and <span class="accented">incentive to</span> the sin is external, whereas the source of uncleanness is in the heart and in the thoughts, which come from within, and so defile the man. Other sins may be <span class="accented">with</span> and <span class="accented">by means of</span> the body, and may <span class="accented">injure</span> the body; but none are so directly against the sanctity of the whole bodily being as fornication. <span class="cmt_word">Sinneth against his own body.</span> By alienating it from the service of him to whom it belongs; by incorporating it with the degradation of another; by staining the flesh and the body (<a href="../../par/proverbs/5-8.htm">Proverbs 5:8-11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24-32</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-24.htm">Proverbs 7:24-27</a>); by subtly poisoning the inmost sanctities of his own being. St. Paul is here thinking mainly, however, if not exclusively, of the <span class="accented">moral</span> injury and defilement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a></div><div class="verse">What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <i>which is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That your body is the temple</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">a sanctuary</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the Holy Ghost.</span> He has already said that the Church is a shrine or sanctuary of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>); but here for the first time expression is given to one of the deepest and newest truths of Christianity (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). Three great epochs are marked by the use of the word temple. In the Old Testament it means the material temple, the sign of a localized worship and a separated people; in the Gospels our Lord uses it of his own mortal body; in the Epistles it is used (as here) of the body of every baptized Christian, sanctified by the indwelling Spirit of God. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are not your own.</span> We cannot, therefore, use our bodies as though they were absolutely under our own control. They belong to God, and, "whether we live or die, we are the Lord's" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a></div><div class="verse">For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are bought with a price</span>. That price is the blood of Christ, wherewith he purchased the Church (<a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). This metaphor of ransom (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>) has its full and absolute applicability to man. The effect of Christ's death for us is that we are redeemed from slavery and prison, and the right of our possession is with Christ. Thus by various metaphors the effects of redemption are revealed to us on the human side. When we unduly <span class="accented">press</span> the metaphor, and ask <span class="accented">from whom</span> we were purchased, and <span class="accented">to whom</span> the price was paid, we build up scholastic systems which have only led to error, and respecting which the Church has never sanctioned any exclusive opinion. The thoughts touched upon in this verse are fully developed in the Epistle to the Romans. <span class="cmt_word">Glorify God;</span> by behaving as his redeemed children, and therefore by keeping yourselves pure. In these few brief words St. Paul <span class="accented">sums up</span> all he has said, as he did in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>. In your body. The following words, "and in your spirit, which are God's," are a perfectly correct and harmless gloss, but are not found in the best manuscripts, and are foreign to the drift of the passage. Your body is a temple, and in that temple God must be honoured. (As Augustine says, "Dost thou wish to pray in a temple? pray in thyself. But first <span class="accented">be</span> a temple of God.") "Unchastity dishonours God, and that in his own temple (<a href="../../par/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>)" (Meyer). In these clauses St. Paul has touched on three subjects which occupy important sections of the remainder of the Epistle, namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the relation between the sexes (ch. 7.); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the question of idol offerings (ch. 8.); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the doctrine of the resurrection (ch. 15.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_corinthians/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Corinthians 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_corinthians/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Corinthians 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
