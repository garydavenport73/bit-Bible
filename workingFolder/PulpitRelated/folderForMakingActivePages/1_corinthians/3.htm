The word <span class="accented">sarkinos</span> (<span class="accented">earneus</span>), fleshen, implies earthliness and weakness and the absence of spirituality; but <span class="accented">sarki-kos</span> (<span class="accented">carnalis</span>) involves the dominance of the lower nature and antagonism to the spiritual. <span class="cmt_word">As mite babes in Christ.</span> The word "babes" has a good and a bad sense. In its good sense it implies humility and teachableness, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, "In malice be ye babes;" and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>, "As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word;" and in <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>.

The same metaphor is found in Philo; and the young pupils of the rabbis were called "sucklings" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) and "little ones" (camp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not with meat;</span> not with solid food, which is for full grown or spiritually perfect men (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For hitherto;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for ye were not yet</span> - when I preached to you - <span class="accented">able to bear it.</span> The same phrase is used by our Lord in <a href="../../par/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a>, "I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now;" and he taught them in parables, "as they were able to bear it" (<a href="../../par/mark/4-33.htm">Mark 4:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not even now are ye able</span>.

The two latter words are omitted in some of the best manuscripts, and may have been added from <a href="../../par/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>. Partisanship and discord, the sins of the Corinthians - sins which have disgraced so many ages of Church history - are works of the flesh (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>), and involve many other sins (<a href="../../par/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>), and are therefore sure proofs of the carnal mind, though they are usually accompanied by a boast of superior spiritual enlightenment. As men; that is, "as men, not as Christians." To walk as a mere ordinary human being is not to "walk in the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-25.htm">Galatians 5:25</a>); comp.," I speak as a man" (<a href="../../par/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>).

This is a proof that there were jealousies and partisanships among them. We again notice the generous courage of St. Paul in rebuking first those adherents who turned his own name into a party watchword. <span class="cmt_word">Are ye not carnal?</span> The true reading is, "Are ye not men?" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, and so the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Are ye not swayed by mere human passions? The Spirit which you received at baptism ought to have lifted you above these mean rivalries. You ought to be something more than mere men. Religious partisanship is, in the eye of St. Paul, simply irreligious. He sets down party controversies as a distinct proof of carnality. Those who indulge in it are men devoid of the spiritual element.

Ministers. The same word as that rendered "deacons" (<span class="accented">diakonoi</span>); "ministers of Christ on your behalf" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Through whom ye believed.</span> <span class="accented">Through</span> whom," not "<span class="accented">in</span> whom" (Bengel).

If, as is now generally believed, Apollos wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews, we see how striking was his power of strengthening the faith of wavering Churches. Eloquence and a deep insight into the meaning of Scripture, enriched by Alexandrian culture, seem to have been his special endowments (<a href="../../par/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24, 27</a>). The reference of the word "watered" to baptism by Augustine (Ep. 48) is one of the numberless instances of Scripture distorted by ecclesiasticism. <span class="cmt_word">God gave the increase</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>). The thought of every true teacher always is, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise" (<a href="../../par/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>).

In other words, "wise" is here equivalent to "skilful." Since Paul had received the grace of God for this very purpose, he was made "wise" by the knowledge of Christ (for the metaphor of building, see <a href="../../par/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The foundation</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">foundation.</span> Though in truth there is but one foundation, as he proceeds to say, St. Paul always refused to build on the foundation laid by another (<a href="../../par/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Another</span>.

"The <span class="accented">doctrine</span> of Jesus Christ is the foundation of all theology; his <span class="accented">person</span> of all life." This is again and again inculcated in Scripture: <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, "Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation." On this rock the Church is built (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>: <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).

These words seem to symbolize erroneous or imperfect doctrines, which would not stand the test, and which led to evil practices. Such were the" philosophy and vain deceit," "the weak and beggarly dements," "the rudiments of the world," of which he speaks in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>. So in the Midrash Tehillin, the words of false teachers are compared to hay. The doctrines to which he alludes are not and christian, but imperfect and human - such, for instance, as, "Humanas constitutiunculas de cultu, de victo, de frigidis ceremoniis" (Erasmus).

This tense is constantly used to express the continuity and the present working of Divine laws (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>). As the nominative is not expressed, it is uncertain whether "it" refers to "each man's work" or to" the day." Either gives an apposite sense (<a href="../../par/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>). Some would make "he" (namely, Christ) the nominative, because "the day" means "the day of Christ;" and in favour of this view they quote <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, "The revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven in flaming fire." But the ellipse of an unexpressed nominative is harsh. <span class="cmt_word">The fire itself shall prove each man's work.</span> This is the "probatory" or testing fire of the day of the Lord, of which we read very frequently in the Fathers. The doctrine of purgatory has been in some measure founded on this verse (Council of Florence, A.D. 1439); but such a view of it cannot be maintained. The reader will find the subject examined and the quotations from the Fathers given in the writer's 'Mercy and Judgment,' p. 69. All that is said here is that the fire of Christ's presence - the consuming fire of God's love - shall <span class="accented">test</span> the work, not <span class="accented">purge</span> it. The fire is <span class="accented">probatory</span>, not <span class="accented">purgatorial</span>, and it is not in itself a fife of wrath, for it tests the gold and silver as well as the inferior elements of the structure. It is the fire of the refiner, not of the avenger.

One of the teacher's rewards will be his converts (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>), who will be "his joy and crown of glorying" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>); another will be "a crown of glory that fadeth not away" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>); yet another will be fresh opportunities for higher labour (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-23.htm">Matthew 25:23</a>).

It is an inexpressible source of comfort to us, amid the weakness and ignorance of our lives, to know that if we have only erred through human frailty and feebleness, while yet we desired to be sincere and faithful, the work will be burnt, yet the workman will be saved. Some of the Fathers gave to this beautiful verse the shockingly perverted meaning that "the workman would be <span class="accented">preserved alive</span> for endless torments," "salted with fire" in order to endure interminable agonies. The meaning is impossible, for it reverses the sense of the word "saved;" and makes it equivalent to "damned;" but the interpretation is an awful proof of the distortions to which a merciless human rigorism and a hard, self styled orthodoxy have sometimes subjected the Word of God. <span class="cmt_word">Yet so as by fire;</span> rather, <span class="accented">through</span> or <span class="accented">by means of fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>).

Similarly it is said in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a> that Noah was saved "through water" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The ship is lost, the sailor saved; the workman is saved, the work is burned.

Out of this Epistle it only occurs in <a href="../../par/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That ye are the temple of God.</span> "Ye," both collectively (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>) and individually; "God's shrine;" not built for men's glory. The word "temple" in the Old Testament always means the material temple; in the Gospels our Lord "spake of the temple of his body;" in the rest of the New Testament the body of every baptized Christian is the temple of God (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16</a>), because "God dwelleth in him" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>). In another aspect Christians can be regarded as "living stones in one spiritual house" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). <span class="accented">The temple</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the shrine</span> (<span class="accented">uses</span>) wherein God dwells (<span class="accented">naiei</span>), and which is the holiest part of the temple (<span class="accented">hieron</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <i>temple</i> ye are.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man defile the temple of God.</span> The verb is the same as in the next clause, and should be rendered, <span class="accented">If any man destroy the temple of God</span>; but the word is perhaps too strong, and the word "mar" or "injure" might better convey the meaning (Olshausen). The two verbs are brought into vivid juxtaposition in the original: "God shall ruin the ruiner of his temple." St. Paul was, perhaps, thinking of the penalty of death attached to any one who desecrated the temple of Jerusalem. Inscriptions on the <span class="accented">chel</span>, or "middle wall of partition," threatened death to any Gentile who set foot within the sacred enclosure." <span class="cmt_word">Which temple ye are;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the which are ye</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ye are holy. St. Paul is here referring to the Church of Corinth, and to the false teachers who desecrated it by bringing in "factions of destruction" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). Ideally the Church was glorious, "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).

Like the other formula, "Be not deceived" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>); "Deceive not yourselves" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-9.htm">Jeremiah 37:9</a>); "Let no man deceive you" (Marl 24:4; <a href="../../par/luke/21-8.htm">Luke 21:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). We are so liable to self deception (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a>), as well as to being deceived by others (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-13.htm">2 Timothy 3:13</a>), that there was need to repeat this warning incessantly. <span class="cmt_word">Seemeth to be wise;</span> rather, <span class="accented">thinketh that he is wise.</span> He is referring specially to the Apollos party, who vaunted their esoteric knowledge, and so were "wise in their own eyes, prudent in their own conceits" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.

This is one of the few references to the Book of Job in the New Testament. It comes from the speech of Eliphaz in <a href="../../par/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>, but St. Paul substitutes the words "clutching" (<span class="accented">drassomenos</span>) and "craftiness" (<span class="accented">panourgia</span>) for the milder <span class="accented">katalabon</span> and <span class="accented">phronesei of</span> the LXX.

St. Paul substitutes "the wise" for the "men" of the original, because the psalmist is referring to perverse despisers of God. <span class="accented">Dialogismoi</span> is rather "reasonings" than "thoughts." It is used in a disparaging sense, as in <a href="../../par/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>.

Instead of becoming partisans of special teachers, and champions of separate doctrines, they might enjoy all that was good in the doctrine of all teachers, whether they were prophets, or pastors, or evangelists (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11, 12</a>).

Instead of becoming partisans of either, they could enjoy the greatness of all. <span class="cmt_word">Or the world.</span> The sudden leap from Cephas to the world shows, as Bengel says, the impetuous leap of thought. There is a passage of similar eloquence in <a href="../../par/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38, 39</a>. The "hundredfold" is promised even in this world (<a href="../../par/mark/10-29.htm">Mark 10:29, 30</a>). Or life.

Christians possess because they are possessed by Christ (Meyer). Christ is our Master, and God our Father (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-10.htm">Matthew 23:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Christ is God's;</span> because "Christ is equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, but inferior to the Father as touching his manhood." Hence in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a> he says, "The head of Christ is God;" and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-28.htm">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>, we read of Christ resigning his mediatorial kingdom, that God may be all in all. Perhaps St. Paul implies the thought that Christ belongs, not to a party, but to God, the Father of us all. But the ultimate climax from Christ to God is found also in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>: <a href="../../par/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_corinthians/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Corinthians 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_corinthians/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Corinthians 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
