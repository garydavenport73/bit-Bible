In continuance of the same lesson, he teaches them historically that the possession of great privileges is no safeguard, and that the seductions, even of idolatry, must not be carelessly despised. Although the connection of the various paragraphs is not stated with logical precision, we see that they all bear on the one truth which he wants to inculcate, namely, that it is both wise and kind to limit our personal freedom out of sympathy with others. The reading "but" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, morever) is probably a correction of the true reading (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, for), due to the failure to understand the whole train of thought. <span class="cmt_word">I would not that ye should be ignorant.</span> This is a favourite phrase of St. Paul's (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). The ignorance to which he refers is not ignorance of the facts, but of the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the facts. <span class="cmt_word">All our fathers.</span> He repeats the "all" five times, because he wishes to show that, though "all" partook of spiritual blessings, most (ver. 5) fell in spite of them. He says, "our fathers," not only because he was himself a Jew, but also because the patriarchs and the Israelites were spiritually the fathers of the Christian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Were under the cloud.</span> The compressed Greek phrase implies that they <span class="accented">went</span> under it, and remained under its shadow. The "cloud" is the "pillar of cloud" (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), of which David says, "He spread a cloud <span class="accented">for a covering"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>).

The passing under the cloud (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>) and through the sea, constituting as it did their deliverance from bondage into freedom, their death to Egypt, and their birth to a new covenant, was a general type or dim shadow of Christian baptism (compare our collect, "figuring thereby thy holy baptism").

The manna might be called "a spiritual food," both because it was "angels' food" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>; Wisd. 16:20) and "bread from heaven" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31</a>), and also because it was a type of "God's good Spirit," which he "gave to instruct them" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>). St. Paul only knows of <span class="accented">two</span> sacraments. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same spiritual drink.</span> The water from the smitten rock might (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>) be called a "spiritual" drink, both as being a miraculous gift (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>, where Isaac is said to be "born <span class="accented">after the spirit"</span>), and as being a type of that "living water" which "springs up into everlasting life" (<a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), and of the blood of Christ in the Eucharist (<a href="../../par/john/6-55.htm">John 6:55</a>). These "waters in the wilderness" and "rivers in the desert" were a natural symbol of the grace of God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), especially as bestowed in the sacrament through material signs. <span class="cmt_word">They drank;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they were drinking</span>, implying a <span class="accented">continuous</span> gift. <span class="cmt_word">Of that spiritual Rock that followed them;</span> rather, literally, <span class="accented">of a spiritual following Rock.</span> This is explained <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a mere figure of speech, in which the natural rock which Moses smote is left out of sight altogether; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as meaning that not the rock, but the water from the rock, followed after them in their wanderings (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>). There can, however, be little or no doubt that St. Paul refers to the common Jewish Hagadah, that the actual material rock did follow the Israelites in their wanderings. The rabbis said that it was round, and rolled itself up like a swarm of bees, and that, when the tabernacle was pitched, this rock came and settled in its vestibule, and began to flow when the princes came to it and sang, "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it" (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-17.htm">Numbers 21:17</a>). It does not, of course, follow from this allusion that St. Paul, or even the rabbis, believed their Hagadah <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">other than a metaphorical sense.</span> The Jewish Hagadoth - legends and illustrations and inferences of an imaginative Oriental people - are not to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre.</span> St. Paul obviates the laying of any stress on the mere legend by the qualifying word, "a <span class="accented">spiritual</span> Rock." <span class="cmt_word">And that Rock was Christ.</span> The writings of Philo, and the Alexandrian school of thought in general, had familiarized all Jewish readers with language of this kind. They were accustomed to see types of God, or of the Word (<span class="accented">Logos</span>), in almost every incident of the deliverance from Egypt and the wanderings in the wilderness. Thus in Wisd. 10:15 and Wisdom 11:4 it is Wisdom - another form of the <span class="accented">Logos</span> - who leads and supports the Israelites. The frequent comparison, of God to a Rock in the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a>, etc.) would render the symbolism more easy, especially as in <a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a> we find, "Behold, I [Jehovah] will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb."

But, in spite of Alford's decisive rejection of it, the rendering, "Now in these things they proved to be figures of us," is at least equally probable. To the intent. Of course, the events had their own immediate instruction, but the example which they involved was the ulterior purpose of their being so ordained by the providence of God. <span class="cmt_word">As they also lusted.</span> (For quails, <a href="../../par/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4, 33</a>; and see <a href="../../par/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-11</a>.)

Another reading is "the Lord." "Christ" may have come in from a marginal gloss.

The last verse was a warning; this is an encouragement. Having just heard what efforts even St. Paul had to make to run in the Christian race, and how terribly their fathers in the wilderness had failed to meet the requirements of God, they might be inclined to throw up every effort in despair.

God is faithful He had called them (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>), and since he knew "how to deliver the godly out of temptations" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>), he would surely perform his side of the covenant, and, if they did their parts, would stablish and keep them from evil (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>).

The meaning is that, by sharing in the sacrifices, the Jews stood in direct association with the altar, the victims, and all that they symbolized (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-27.htm">Deuteronomy 12:27</a>).

If a Christian merely bought his meat in the open market, no one could suspect him of meaning thereby to connive at or show favour to idolatry.

The rabbis decided very differently. "If," said Rabbi Ishmael, "an idolater makes a feast in honour of his son, and invites all the Jews of his town, they eat of the sacrifices of the dead, even though they eat and drink of their own" ('Avodah Zarah,' fol. 18, 1). There are many passages of the Talmud which raise the suspicion that the rabbis are <span class="accented">purposely</span> running counter to the teaching of the New Testament.

Perhaps there is a touch of delicate reserve in the word, implying that the remark is made at the table of heathens, who would be insulted by the word <span class="accented">eidolothuton</span>, sacrificed to <span class="accented">idols.</span> Whoever the interlocutor is supposed to be - heathen host or Christian guest - the mere fact of attention being drawn to the food as forming part of a heathen sacrifice is enough to make it your duty to give no overt sanction to idolatry. In that case, therefore, you ought to refuse it. It will be seen how gross was the calumny which asserted that St. Paul taught men to be <span class="accented">indifferent</span> about eating things offered to idols. He only taught indifference in cases where idolatry could not be directly involved in the question. He only repudiates the idle superstition that the food became <span class="accented">inherently tainted</span> by such a consecration when the eater was unaware of it. In later times, when the eating of such offerings was deliberately erected into a test of apostasy, he would have used language as strong against every semblance of compliance as any which was used by St. John himself or by Justin Martyr. Difference of time and circumstances necessarily involves a difference in the mode of viewing matters which in <span class="accented">themselves</span> are unimportant. <span class="cmt_word">For the earth is the Lord's.</span> It is doubtful whether the repetition of this clause is genuine.

The mere fact that another person <span class="accented">thinks</span> that we are doing wrong does not furnish the smallest proof that we <span class="accented">are</span> doing wrong. We stand or fall only to our own Master, and our consciences are free to form their own independent conclusion. Perhaps in this clause and the next verse we have an echo of the arguments used by the Corinthian "liberals," who objected to sacrifice themselves to the scruples of the weak. The independence of conscience is powerfully maintained in <a href="../../par/romans/14-2.htm">Romans 14:2-5</a>.

Another view of these clauses interprets them to mean "You should refrain because, by net doing so, you give occasion to others to judge you" - a rule which has been compared with <a href="../../par/romans/14-16.htm">Romans 14:16</a>, "Let not your good be evil spoken of." Whichever view be taken, it is clear that <span class="accented">theoretically</span> St. Paul sided with the views of the "strong," but <span class="accented">sympathetically</span> with those of the "weak." He pleaded for some concession to the scrupulosity of ever morbid consciences, he disapproved of a defiant, ostentatious, insulting liberalism. On the other hand, he discouraged the miserable micrology of a purblind and bigoted superstition, which exaggerated the importance of things external and indifferent. He desiderated more considerateness and self denial on the one side; and on the other, a more robust and instructed faith, he would always tolerate the scruples of the weak, but would not suffer either weakness or strength to develop itself into a vexatious tyranny.
