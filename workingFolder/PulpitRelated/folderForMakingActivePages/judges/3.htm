This word <span class="accented">to prove</span> is used here in a somewhat different sense from that which it bears in ver. 4 and in <a href="../../par/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>. In those passages it is used of their moral probation, of proving or testing their faith and obedience; but here it is rather in the sense of "to exercise" or "to accustom them," to train them to war. A considerable period of <span class="accented">rest</span> had followed Joshua's conquest, during which the younger Israelites had no experience of war; but if they were to keep their hold of Canaan, it was needful that the warlike spirit should be kept up in their breasts.

It occurs repeatedly in ch. 16; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5, 6, 29</a>, etc. The word means an <span class="accented">axle-tree. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The entering in of Hamath</span>. There are two theories in regard to Hamath. Some, as Professor Rawlinson in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' identify it with <span class="accented">Hamah</span>, a large and important city on the Orontes in Upper Syria, and consider <span class="accented">that</span> the kingdom of Hamath, which was overthrown by the king of Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>), and of which Hamath was the capital, was for the most part an independent Hamitic or Canaanite kingdom (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), but occasionally, as in the days of Solomon and Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), subject to Israel Others, however, justly considering the great improbability of the Israelite dominion having ever extended so far north as the valley of the Orontes, and observing how it is spoken of as an integral part of Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>), look for Hamath much further south, in the neighbourhood of Beth-rehob (see <a href="../../par/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>, note). As regards the phrase "the entering in of Hamath," the identical Hebrew words occur seven times, viz., <a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; in this passage; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>, and are variously rendered in the A.V.: "as men come to Hamath;" "unto the entrance of Hamath;" "the entering into Hamath;" "the entering in of Hamath (three times); and the entering of Hamath." The exact meaning of  the phrase seems to be "the approach to  Hamath," some particular spot in the valley  from whence the direct road to Hamath begins; very much like the railway term for  certain stations which are the nearest to,  though at some little distance from, the  place from which they are named, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>,  Shapwick Road, Mildenhall Road, etc. The latter words of the verse describe the territory of the Hivites, which reached from Mount Baal-hermon in the Lebanon range as far as the point where the road leads to Hamath.

Intermarriage with the Canaanite nations had been expressly forbidden (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a>), and the reason of the prohibition clearly stated, and for some time after Joshua's death no such marriages appear to have been contracted. But now the fatal step was taken, and the predicted consequence immediately ensued: "they served their gods;.., they forgat the Lord their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:7-11 This section introduces us into the actual narrative of the Book of Judges, the prefatory matter being now concluded. The whole book proceeds on the same model as this section does. The apostasy of Israel; their servitude under the oppressor sent to chastise them; their cry of distress and penitence; their deliverance by the judge raised up to save them; the rest which follows their deliverance. There is infinite variety in the details of the successive narratives, but they are all formed on the same plan.

According to Judith 6:15, he had a descendant, <span class="accented">Chabris</span>, living in the time of Holofernes. The Hebrew, though grammatically it favours the view that Othniel was the brother of Caleb, does not absolutely exclude the rendering that Kenaz was his brother, and so Othniel his nephew. Compare <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7</a>, where the words "thine uncle" apply to Shallum, not to Hanameel, as is clear from ver. 8. And as the chronology seems to make it impossible that Othniel should be Caleb's brother, since Caleb was eighty-five years old at the time of Othniel's marriage, and Othniel therefore could not be less than fifty-five, an improbable age for his marriage; and since, again, Othniel could not well have been less than eighty at Joshua's death, which, allowing only ten years for the elders, and reckoning the eight years for Chushan's dominion, would make him ninety-eight when he was raised up to deliver Israel, it is a lesser difficulty to take Othniel as the nephew of Caleb, by understanding the words, <span class="accented">Caleb's younger brother</span>, to apply to Kenaz. But perhaps the least objectionable escape from the difficulty is to take the phrase in its most natural grammatical sense, but to understand the word <span class="accented">brother</span> in its wider and very common sense of <span class="accented">kinsman</span> or <span class="accented">fellow-tribesman.</span> They were both sons of Kenaz, or Kenizzites. Caleb was the head of the tribe, and Othniel was next to him in tribal dignity, and his junior in age, but probably succeeded to the chieftainship on Caleb's death. This would leave the exact relationship between Caleb and Othniel uncertain.

The first part of the verse only belongs to the preceding section, which it closes quite naturally. The result of Othniel's victories was a rest of forty years (cf. ver. 30; 5:31; 8:28, etc.). The latter half of the verse - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Othniel the son of Kenaz died</span> - begins a new section, and is introductory to the first apostasy, which followed after his death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:13-31

The Amalekites appear, from <a href="../../par/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>, to have been a branch of the Edomites, and the latest mention of them in the Bible finds a remnant of them in the neighbourhood of Mount Seir in the days of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41-43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The city of palm trees</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jericho, as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>.

A left-handed man wearing no sword or dagger on his left side, and using his right hand for other purposes, would naturally throw a man off his guard.

This is an isolated movement of the Philistines, alluded to in <a href="../../par/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11</a>, but of which we have no further details. In <a href="../../par/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a> we read of Israel worshipping the gods of the Phllistines, and of an alliance between the Ammonites and Philistines to vex Israel; but the precise connection between the events of the two chapters, or the exact time when either occurred, cannot be determined with certainty. Nothing more is known of Shamgar, except the mention of him in Deborah's song (<a href="../../par/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
