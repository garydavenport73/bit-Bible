Rather, <span class="accented">the angel of the Lord</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the angel of his presence, whose message consequently is delivered as if the Lord himself were speaking (see <a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7, 9, 11</a>, etc.). A good example of the difference between a message delivered by a prophet and one delivered by the angel of the Lord may be seen by comparing <a href="../../par/judges/6-8.htm">Judges 6:8</a> with <a href="../../par/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-16</a>. Bochim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> weepers (vers. 4, 5). The site is unknown, but it was probably near Shiloh. The phrase "came up" denotes that it was in the hill country. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</div><div class="comm">

It was this that made the people weep. <span class="cmt_word">Thorns in your sides</span>. This is not a translation of the Hebrew text, which only has "for sides," but a partial adaptation of <a href="../../par/joshua/23-13.htm">Joshua 23:13</a>, where the phrase is "scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes." Either the words for "scourges in" have fallen out of the text, or the word here rendered "sides" should be rendered, as some think, "enemies." A snare. See <a href="../../par/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>, note. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-4.htm">Judges 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</div><div class="comm">

A clear intimation that they were near Shiloh, where the tabernacle was. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Joshua</span>, etc. The same words as <a href="../../par/joshua/22-6.htm">Joshua 22:6</a>, marking the identity of time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:7-13 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-7.htm">Judges 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the people served</span>, etc. This verse is the epitome of the religious history of Israel from the time of the expostulation of the angel till the dying off of all those who had been elders in the time of Joshua. It probably includes some forty or fifty years from the entrance into Canaan, viz., about thirty years of Joshua's lifetime, and ten, fifteen, or twenty years after Joshua's death. The record of the people's continuance in the service of the Lord connects itself with the promise made by them in <a href="../../par/joshua/24-21.htm">Joshua 24:21, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">All the great works</span>, etc. Scarcely those prior to the crossing of the Jordan, though some might remember some of the events in the wilderness when they were mere children (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>), but the victories in Canaan. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - These three verses are identical with <a href="../../par/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29-31</a>, except that the order is slightly varied. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-8.htm">Judges 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, <i>being</i> an hundred and ten years old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and ten years old</span>. Caleb was eighty-five years old, he tells us (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>), when he went to take possession of Hebron, forty-five years after the spies had searched Canaan from Kadesh-Barnea, and consequently some time in the seventh year of the entrance into Canaan. Joshua was probably within a year or two his contemporary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Timnath-heres</span>. Probably, though not certainly, the modern <span class="accented">Tibneh</span>, six miles from Jifna. It is called in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a> and Joshua 24:30 <span class="accented">Timnath-serah</span>, the letters of which are identical, but the order is inverted. <span class="accented">Timnath-heres is</span> probably the right form. It means "The portion of the Sun." We have <span class="accented">Mount Heres</span> in <a href="../../par/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>, near Ajalon. <span class="accented">Ir-shemesh</span> (city of the sun) and <span class="accented">Beth-shemesh</span> (house of the sun) are other instances of places called from the sun. Some have supposed some connection between the name <span class="accented">Timnath. heres</span>, as Joshua's inheritance, and the miracle of the sun standing still upon Gibeon at the word of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12, 13</a>). The neighbourhood of Timnath-heres to Ajalon (<a href="../../par/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>) may give some countenance to this. The hill Gaash is only elsewhere mentioned as the birthplace of Hiddai or Hurai (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-30.htm">2 Samuel 23:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-32.htm">1 Chronicles 11:32</a>), but the exact site is unknown. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which know not the Lord</span>, etc. The memory of God's great works gradually faded away, and with this memory their influence upon the hearts of the people. The seductions of idolatry and the influence of heathen example were ever fresh and powerful. Had the people obeyed the voice of the Lord, the idolatry and the idolaters would have been out of the way. We may notice by the way the value to the Church of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in keeping alive a perpetual memory of Christ's precious death until his coming again.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baal and Ashtaroth</span>. <span class="accented">Ashtaroth</span> is the plural of <span class="accented">Ashtoreth</span>, the goddess of the Zidonians (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5, 33</a>), just as <span class="accented">Baalim</span> (ver. 11) is the plural of Baal. The many images of Baal and Ashtoreth are, in the opinion of some, indicated by the plural; but others think that different modifications or impersonations of the god and goddess are indicated. Thus we read of <span class="accented">Baal-berith</span>, the god who presides over covenants; <span class="accented">Baal-zebul</span>, or <span class="accented">Zebub</span>, the god who presides over flies, who could either send or remove a plague of flies, and so on. "Baal (lord or master) was the supreme male divinity of the Phoenician and Canaanitish nations, as Ashtoreth (perhaps <span class="accented">the star</span>, the planet Venus) was their supreme female divinity. Baal and Ashtoreth are frequently coupled together. Many Phoenician names - Hannibal, Asdrubal, Adherbal, Belus, etc. - are derived from Baal." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:14-23

Compare <a href="../../par/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>, which shows how closely allied the notions of <span class="accented">anger</span> and <span class="accented">jealousy</span> are in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">He sold</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>. A forcible expression, implying the handing over of the people into the hands of their enemies, as if God had no more any property in them or concern about them; as if he said, "Ye are not my people, and I am not your God;" as if he said to the heathen, "Take them, and do as you will with them; they are yours, not mine" (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>. and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord had sworn</span>, etc., showing that God fulfilled his threatenings as well as his promises.

In <a href="../../par/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>, an additional reason is given for the gradual extirpation of the Canaanites - "<span class="accented">lest</span> <span class="accented">the beasts of the field increase upon thee."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
