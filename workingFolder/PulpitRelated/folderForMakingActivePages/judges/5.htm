It is a song of wonderful beauty and lyric power, somewhat difficult, as all Hebrew poetry is. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Her first feeling was one of patriotic joy that her countrymen had been roused to the venture of war, and of gratitude to God that it was so. "For the bold leading of the leaders of Israel, for the willing following of the people, praise ye the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-3.htm">Judges 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, <i>even</i> I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing <i>praise</i> to the LORD God of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Her song was worthy to be listened to by kings and princes. She calls their attention to the tale she had to tell of the great acts of the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - The recent victory recalled the glories of those days when God brought up Israel from Egypt into Canaan. She specifies the march from Seir or Her, and the day when Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">The mountains melted from before the LORD, <i>even</i> that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - From what misery God had saved the people! In the days of her predecessor Shamgar, when the Philistines overran the country, when Heber the Kenite still dwelt in the south of Judah, all traffic ceased in the land. The caravans were stopped, and travellers slunk into the by-ways. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a></div><div class="verse"><i>The inhabitants of</i> the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Instead of <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of the villages ceased</span>, some render the <span class="accented">leaders ceased.</span> Till Deborah arose and stirred up Barak, there was no one to put himself at the head of the people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">They chose new gods; then <i>was</i> war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The cause of this misery was not far to seek; it was the idolatry of the people which provoked God to anger. Then their enemies were let loose upon them, and they dared make no resistance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">My heart <i>is</i> toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - What a contrast with that fainthearted submission was the recent triumphant rising! Exultation and thanksgiving for the devotion of the people break out again, as in ver. 2. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - She appeals to the nobles who ride on white (or roan) asses, and sit on rich saddle-cloths (not <span class="accented">sit in judgment</span>), and to the people who walk by the way, alike to speak of the great deliverance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a></div><div class="verse"><i>They that are delivered</i> from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, <i>even</i> the righteous acts <i>toward the inhabitants</i> of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - A very difficult verse, and very variously rendered. For <span class="accented">archers</span> some give the interpretation <span class="accented">dividers</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> MEN SHARING THE BOOTY THEY HAVE TAKEN; or, SINGING IN ALTERNATE VERSES. For <span class="accented">They</span> that are <span class="accented">delivered</span> from, some render <span class="accented">far away</span> from. Others again take the preposition <span class="accented">from</span> in the not uncommon sense of <span class="accented">more than</span>, meaning here <span class="accented">louder than</span>. The chief different senses which emerge are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of the A.V.: "Those that can now draw water from the wells without being molested by the hostile archers shall sing praises to God in the very spots where they were wont to be attacked." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Far from the noise and tumult of those that divide the spoil among the water-troughs, there shall they sing, - etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "With a louder voice than that of the <span class="accented">shepherds</span> who sing among the water-troughs (while they are watering their flocks), there shall they rehearse," <span class="accented">etc.</span> Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> combining (2) and (3), "With a voice louder (and more exultant) than that of those who divide the spoil, there shall they rehearse," etc. <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of his villages</span>.

Then shall the people... go down to the gates of the cities</span> for judgment, or to the bazaars, as in old times, without fear of their enemies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake</span>, etc. She seems to go back in thought to the moment when she received the Divine call to her mission of deliverance, and executed it by the voice of her stirring prophecies. Then she lashed her soul into action, and roused Barak from his lethargy by the promise of spoil and victory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/5-13.htm">Judges 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Then he gave dominion to a mere remnant of Israel over the powerful among the people of Canaan, the Lord gave me dominion over the mighty men of Jabin.

The word so rendered is only found here. <span class="accented">The brook of ancient</span> days, or things, probably means the brook celebrated from of old by the warlike deeds done on its banks.
