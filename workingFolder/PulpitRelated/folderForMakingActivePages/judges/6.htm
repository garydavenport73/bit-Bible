An abiding national feud was the natural consequence; and this, added to their love of plunder, no doubt led to the present invasion in company with the Amalekites (<a href="../../par/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>, note).

We first find this term in <a href="../../par/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>, where it is applied to the people of Haran. Comparing the analogous phrases, "the east country" (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>), the mountains of the east (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>), "the men of the east" (<a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), "the east" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>), we gather that the country lying to the east of Palestine as far as the river Euphrates was called the east country, and that the various tribes of Arabs and others who peopled that desert were called "the children of the cast" (see ver. 33 and <a href="../../par/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>).

Observe the simple way in which the ministration of the angel is introduced, as if it were a matter of course in the eyes of him who is the Lord of the millions of the heavenly host, those ministers of his who do his pleasure. Human scepticism, the twin sister of human selfishness, would blot out all creation except itself. <span class="cmt_word">To hide it</span>, etc. These graphic touches give a lively picture of the straits to which the Israelites were reduced by the Midianite occupation.

The great plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon (which is the Greek form of the name), through which the Kishon flows, is eight hours in length from east to west, and five hours (twelve miles) in breadth from north to south. It is described as "a very extensive and fertile plain shut in between the mountain ranges of Samaria and Mount Carmel on the south, and of Galilee on the north," and extending from the Mediterranean at the Gulf of <span class="accented">Caipha</span>, or <span class="accented">Haipha</span>, to the valley of the Jordan. The access to it from the fords of Jordan in the neighbourhood of Bethshan (or <span class="accented">Beishan</span>, called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Scythopolis</span>) made it the natural place for invasion by the wild tribes east of Jordan, as it is to this day. Particular parts of this great plain are called "the valley, of Megiddo" and "the plain of Samaria." For a full account of the plain of Esdraelon see Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 9. <span class="cmt_word">Went over</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> crossed the Jordan. It appears from vers. 3-5 that these invasions were repeated at certain seasons. When they had plundered all they could get, and eaten up all the produce of the land, they would go back for a while to their own country east of Jordan, and then return again. So they did now, but they met with a different reception this time.

The b has probably fallen out by accident. Here we have the immediate fruit of Gideon s daring in the cause of God. The whole family of Abi-ezer, numbering probably thousands, sprang to his side. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/6-35.htm">Judges 6:35</a></div><div class="verse">And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sent messengers</span>, etc. Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali were the adjacent tribes - Manasseh (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the half tribe of Manasseh, west of Jordan) on the south, Asher on the west, and Zebulun and Naphtali on the north. Three of these were the very tribes who had fought under Barak, and it is pleasing to see Asher now joined with them instead of abiding in his breaches. This ready compliance with the call was the consequence of the Spirit of the Lord being upon Gideon. <span class="cmt_word">Came up</span>.

The thought that he was "the least in his father's house" seems still to possess him, and he can hardly believe it possible that he is to save Israel. In his humility he craves a sign that he is indeed chosen and called.

Possibly the dews were usually heavy upon the hill of Gilead (<a href="../../par/judges/7-3.htm">Judges 7:3</a>, note) where Gideon was encamped, as they seem to have been on Mount Gilboa (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>) and on Hermon (<a href="../../par/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>), and sheep-skins may have been a common protection against the cold nights, as in Afghanistan; and he may have noticed how often in the morning both the skin that covered him, and the ground around, was wet with the heavy dew. And this may have suggested the double test, by which his faith was, through God's condescending mercy, confirmed and established. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
