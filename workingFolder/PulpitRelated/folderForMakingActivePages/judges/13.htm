It by no means follows from this phrase that this chapter is in direct chronological sequence to the preceding The scene is shifted to the tribe of Dan, and to the Philistines on the west, and there is nothing to guide us as to the exact time when the things narrated occurred. But the end of the forty years probably coincided with the judgeship of Samuel; for there was no complete deliverance in the time of Samson, only occasional cheeks to the Philistine domination (see ver. 5). It was not till the days of Samuel that the Philistines were really smitten (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-14</a>). We may suppose the date of the ensuing narrative to be somewhere in the first decade of the Philistine oppression. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name <i>was</i> Manoah; and his wife <i>was</i> barren, and bare not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zorah</span>.

Probably the boundary passed through the city, as that of Judah and Benjamin did through Jerusalem. In <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a> it is transliterated <span class="accented">Zareah</span>, and also ascribed to Judah. It is almost always coupled with Eshtaol, as in ver. 25 of this chapter. It was situated in the Shephelah, or plain country, and was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>). It is supposed to be represented by the modern <span class="accented">Surah</span>, at the entrance of the Wady Ghurab. <span class="cmt_word">The family of the Danites</span>. It appears from <a href="../../par/numbers/26-42.htm">Numbers 26:42, 43</a> that there was only <span class="accented">one family</span> in the <span class="accented">tribe</span> of Dan, so that in this case tribe and family were co-extensive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou <i>art</i> barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt...  bear a son</span>. It is obvious to compare the promise to Abraham and Sarah (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10, 14</a>), to Hannah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17</a>), to Elizabeth (<a href="../../par/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), and to the blessed Virgin (<a href="../../par/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>).

A Nazarite (or, more correctly, a <span class="accented">Nazi-rite</span>) means one <span class="accented">separated</span>, and specially dedicated to God. The law of the Nazarites is contained in <a href="../../par/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, where, however, only <span class="accented">Nazarites of days</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazarites for a definite time, arc spoken cf. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were <span class="accented">perpetual Nazarites</span>, Nazarites of <span class="accented">for ever</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the Mishna classifies them. Abstinence from strong drink, and from anything made of the grape; letting the locks of the head grow unchecked by the razor; and keeping quite clear of any pollution from a dead body, even in case of the death of his nearest relations, were the chief articles of a Nazarite's vow. St. Paul took the vow of a Nazarite of days, and offered the prescribed sacrifices, together with "the hair of the head of his separation," as we read in <a href="../../par/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall begin</span>, etc. This is an exact description of what Samson did. He did not "deliver Israel" as the other judges did; but he began to shake the Philistine power, and prepared the way for the deliverance of Israel in the time of his worthier successor Samuel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance <i>was</i> like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he <i>was</i>, neither told he me his name:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man of God</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a prophet, applied to Moses, Samuel, David, Shemaiah, Elijah, Elisha, and other prophets, and to Timothy in the New Testament. Manoah's wife applies it to the angel, not being sure that he was not human. It would not be improper to apply to an angel, seeing that <span class="accented">Gabriel</span> means <span class="accented">man of God</span>. <span class="cmt_word">I asked him not</span>, etc. No doubt from awe. Jacob, on the contrary, asked the angel with whom he had wrestled, "Tell me, I pray thee, thy name" (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>). See vers. 17, 18. In the Septuagint (Cod. Alex. ) and Vulgate the <span class="accented">not</span> is omitted. "I asked him, but he did not tell me."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-11.htm">Judges 13:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, <i>Art</i> thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I <i>am</i>.</div><div class="comm">

How shall we order the child, and <i>how</i> shall we do unto him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy words come</span>, etc. The verb is singular in the Hebrew here and in ver. 17. Possibly the true reading is <span class="accented">word</span>, as in the Septuagint. If the text is correct, <span class="accented">words</span> must be taken collectively, as making one promise. The saying marks Manoah's earnest desire for a son. Some, however, construe it, <span class="accented">If thy words come. <span class="cmt_word"></span>How shall we order</span>, etc. - literally, <span class="accented">What will be the manner of the child</span>, and what will be his doing? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, <span class="accented">What will be his manner</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>, and following verses), <span class="accented">and what will be his action or work?</span> or, <span class="accented">What will be his proper treatment</span>, <span class="accented">and what shall be done to him?</span> The former is the most natural rendering of the words, and though the latter seems at first more suitable to the angel's reply, yet if we take the angel's reply as referring Manoah to what he had said before in vers. 4 and 5, we have a distinct answer to the questions. His manner will be to live as a Nazarite, and his action or work will be to begin to deliver israel (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, where both the <span class="accented">manner</span> and the actione of Ishmael are foretold). In fact, Manoah's question refers directly to vers. 4 and 5, and is a request to have a confirmation of what was then said; just as David asked again and again, <span class="accented">What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine?</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26, 30</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-15.htm">Judges 13:15</a></div><div class="verse">And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us detain thee</span>, etc. He wishes to detain him as a guest till he has had time to cook a kid for him (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For thee</span>. The Hebrew is <span class="accented">before thee.</span> The phrase is elliptical. The full sentence would be, <span class="accented">until we have dressed a kid</span> and set it <span class="accented">before thee</span>, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he <i>was</i> an angel of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not eat of thy bread</span>, etc. The angel refuses to eat of his meat, but suggests that if he would offer the kid as a burnt offering, he must <span class="cmt_word">offer it to the Lord</span>. The angel, perhaps perceiving that Manoah was in doubt as to who he might be, had a holy dread lest he might offer the kid to him, just as the angel whom St. John was about to worship said, "See thou do it not" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>); and Barnabas and Paul ran in among the people of Lycaonia to restrain them from offering sacrifice to them (<a href="../../par/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14-18</a>). The order of the words, which is rightly given in the A.V., makes it a clear direction to offer the sacrifice to no one but the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What <i>is</i> thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is thy name</span>? See note to ver. 6. The phrase is very peculiar, literally, <span class="accented">Who is thy name?</span> as if he had been going to say, <span class="accented">Who art thou?</span> and then changed the form to is <span class="accented">thy name.</span> The Hebrews seem to have attached great importance to names, a circumstance due, in part, to every name being significant in the spoken language (see <a href="../../par/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/16-5.htm">Genesis 16:5</a>, etc.; Genesis 17:19; 25:25, 26; 29 and Genesis 30; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a> <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>, etc., and. many other passages). Compare also the phrase, <span class="accented">the name of the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5, 6, 7</a>). Manoah had certainly some suspicious as to the mysterious character of his visitor, and expected the name to reveal his true nature. <span class="cmt_word">We may do thee honour</span>. Manoah seems throughout to use ambiguous language, suitable either to a man, if he was speaking to a man, or to a celestial visitant, should he be angel or God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it <i>is</i> secret?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is secret</span>. The Hebrew word does not mean <span class="accented">secret</span>, but <span class="accented">wonderful</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> it is rendered in <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, and elsewhere. His name was one which, as St. Paul expresses it, it is not lawful, or possible, for a man to utter (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>), it was so transcendently wonderful. The feeling of the Hebrews in abstaining from uttering the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> was akin to this. Some take the angel to say that WONDERFUL is his name, but the A.V. is right in prefixing seeing <span class="accented">- seeing it is wonderful.</span>

But we must not look for strict compliance with the Levitical law in the lawless days of the Judges, though we find many of its prescribed ordinances in use, as, for instance, the institution of Nazarites, and here the offering of the meat offering with the burnt offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And the angel</span>. These words are rightly inserted, to give the sense of the original, as more fully explained in the following verse. <span class="cmt_word">Did wonderously</span> - literally, <span class="accented">was wondrous in his doing.</span> The verb here is the same root as the substantive or adjective <span class="accented">wonder</span>, or <span class="accented">wonderful</span>, <span class="accented">in ver.</span> 18.

And so Isaiah said, "Woe is me! for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). So again the Lord said to Moses, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The name of the well, Beer-lahai-roi, is also thought to mean the well of him that is alive after seeing God (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>). And Jacob called the name of the place where he wrestled with the angel Peniel, "for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved" (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). See too <a href="../../par/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>. The same belief also prevailed amongst the heathen, that seeing a god without his special permission was visited by death or some grave calamity, as Callimachus, quoted by Grotius, says- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The laws of Saturn thus decree,<br />Who dares immortal gods to see<br />Shall suffer loss, whoe'er he be."</span>

With the acceptance of the sacrifice the conscience was cleared from guilt. The ascent of the angel in the flame of the altar was to her the same evidence of an accepted sacrifice as the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus are to us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-24.htm">Judges 13:24</a></div><div class="verse">And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Called his name Samson</span>. No doubt the name was significant of what the child should be (see note to ver. 17), but the etymology and meaning of the name are doubtful. Josephus ('Antiq.,' V. 8:4) says the name means "a strong one," but he does not say in what language, and it does not appear to have such a meaning in any Semitic dialect. It is commonly interpreted to mean <span class="accented">like the sun</span>, from <span class="accented">shemesh</span>, the common word for the sun; and so Jerome in his 'Onomasticon' expounds it as <span class="accented">the sun's strength</span>,' possibly with an allusion to <a href="../../par/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>. Others make it equal <span class="accented">shim-</span>shorn, from the Pilpel conjugation of <span class="accented">shamem</span>, <span class="accented">to devastate.</span> Another possible derivation is from the Chaldee <span class="accented">shemash</span>, <span class="accented">to minister</span>, specially in sacred things, a root from which the Nestorian, Syriac, and Arabic names for a deacon are derived. If this were the derivation, it would be a reference to his dedication to God as a Nazarite from his mother's womb, the only thing his mother knew about him when she gave him the name.
