A very interesting account of the Prince of Wales's visit to the Mosque of Hebron in 1862 is given in Dean Stanley s 'Sermons in the East.' David reigned in Hebron seven years and six mouths before he transferred the seat of power to Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>, etc.; 2 Samuel 5:1-5).

The Septuagint reads, "Othniel urged her to ask the field of her father," and the Vulgate has, "Her husband told her to ask her father," and then it follows naturally, "and she lighted from off her ass," etc. But the Hebrew reading may be right, and it may be that when her husband, brave in storming a city, but timid in asking a favour, hung back, she, with the tenacious will of a woman, sprang off the ass herself, and successfully preferred her request. Dean Stanley identifies (though not with absolute certainty) the "field thus obtained by Achsah with an unusually green valley amidst the dry, barren hills of the south country, lying south or west of Hebron, called Wady Nuukur, through which Caleb and Achsah must have ridden on their way from Hebron to Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This valley breaks into a precipitous and still greener ravine, and both the upper and lower pastures are watered by a clear, bubbling rivulet, which rises in the upper meadow, and flows to the bottom of the ravine below. The name of a village, <span class="accented">Dewir</span>, seems to represent the ancient <span class="accented">Debir.</span>

Hobab and his tribe, a branch of the Midianites, called Kenites, from an unknown ancestor, <span class="accented">Kain</span>, at first settled in the city of palm trees, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jericho (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>); but it seems that when Judah started on his expedition with Simeon to conquer the south laud, the Kenites went with him.

The chariots of the Canaanites were very formidable to the Israelites, who had no means of coping with them. Thus we are told of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazer, that he had 900 chariots of iron, and mightily oppressed the children of Israel. They were later an important part of King Solomon's army (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). See too <a href="../../par/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>.

When all the spies brought up an evil report of the land, and by doing so raised a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, Caleb the Kenezite, alone with Joshua, stood firm, and, as a reward of his faithfulness, received the promise that he and his seed should possess the land on which his feet had trodden. Accordingly Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the Kenezite (see <a href="../../par/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-36.htm">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6-15</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13, 14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:21-36

The boundary line between Judah and Jerusalem passed through JEBUS or JEBUSI, as Jerusalem was anciently called (see <a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4, 5</a>).

As soon, however, as the Ephraimites conquered it, they reimposed the name, in memory of their father Jacob. The Saxon charters exhibit an analogous change in such transitions of name, as that from <span class="accented">Bedericksworth</span> to <span class="accented">Bury St. Edmunds</span>, which took place after the transfer of St. Edmund's body to the church there, the old name continuing for a time along with the new one, but at last disappearing.

See <a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a>, <span class="accented">Maaleh-acrabbim.</span> In <a href="../../par/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a> "the ascent of Akrabbim." The whole name, put into English, is "the ascent, or going up, of Scorpions," a mountain pass so called from the abundance of scorpions found in the whole region. The exact locality is uncertain, but it is thought to be the pass <span class="accented">El-Safeh</span>, immediately to the south of the Dead Sea. The neighbourhood to Mount Hor and Petra is indicated by its connection here with "the rock," in Hebrew <span class="accented">has-selah</span>, which is the distinctive name of the rocks or cliffs on which Petra is built, and the name of <span class="accented">Petra</span> (the rock) itself. Speaking roughly, a line drawn westward from El-Safeh to the Mediterranean Sea, near the "river of Egypt," formed the southern boundary, of Judah, and of the Amorites whom they displaced. The battle with the Amorites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>), in which the Israelites were discomfited and pursued, is thought to have been at El-Safeh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/24.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 24"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 24" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
