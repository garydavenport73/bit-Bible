See <a href="../../par/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Jabin king of Hazor</span>. The exact site of <span class="accented">Hazor</span> has not been identified with certainty, but it is conjectured by Robinson, with great probability, to have stood on the Tell now called <span class="accented">Khuraibeh</span>, overlooking the waters of Merom (now called Lake Huleh), where are remains of a sepulchre, Cyclopean walls, and other buildings. In <a href="../../par/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-14</a> we read of the total destruction by fire of Hazor, and of the slaughter of Jabin, the king thereof, with all the inhabitants of the city, and of the slaughter of all the confederate kings, and the capture of their cities; Hazor, however, "the head of all those kingdoms," being the only one which was "burnt with fire." It is a little surprising, therefore, to read here of another Jabin reigning in Hazor, with confederate kings under him (<a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), having, like his predecessor, a vast number of chariots (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3, 13</a> with <a href="../../par/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4, 9</a>), and attacking Israel at the head of a great force (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7, 13, 16</a> with <a href="../../par/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>). It is impossible not to suspect that these are two accounts of the same event. If, however, the two events are distinct, we must suppose that the Canaanite kingdoms had been revived under a descendant of the former king, that Hazor had been rebuilt, and that Jabin was the hereditary name of its king. <span class="cmt_word">Gentiles</span>, or <span class="accented">nations</span>, or <span class="accented">Goim</span>, as <a href="../../par/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>, and <a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>. Whether <span class="accented">Goim</span> was the proper name of a particular people, or denoted a collection of different tribes, their seat was in Galilee, called in <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>, <span class="accented">Galilee</span>, <span class="accented">of the nations</span>, or <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, in Hebrew <span class="accented">Goim.</span>

Barak, supposing Sisera still to be with the chariots, pursued after them, and seems to have overtaken them, as they were embarrassed in the rotten, boggy ground which had been suddenly overflowed by the swollen waters of Kishon. Many were swept away by the flood and drowned, the rest put to the sword while their horses were floundering in the bog (<a href="../../par/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21, 22</a>).

But no sooner had he fallen into a deep sleep, than the crafty and courageous woman, into whose hands Sisera was to be sold, took a tent pin and the heavy hammer with which they drove the pin into the ground, and with a desperate blow forced it through his temples, and pinned him to the ground.
