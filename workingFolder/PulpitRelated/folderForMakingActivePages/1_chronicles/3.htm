To the seven years and six months (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>) of David's reign at Hebron six sons belong, each of a different mother. To the thirty and throe years (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) of his reign at Jerusalem belong other thirteen sons, viz. four of one mother, <span class="cmt_word">Bethshua</span>, and nine of other mothers, whose names are not given. The list of the six Hebron sons, with their mothers, is nearly identical with that of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>, although the differences, slight as they are, would of the two indicate our list here rather as <span class="accented">not</span> copied than copied thence. The only noticeable difference, however, is in the name of the second son, announced here as <span class="cmt_word">Daniel</span>, instead of Chileab, while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This, together with the circumstance that one word would, as regards the Hebrew characters, comparatively easily convert into the other. renders it probable that it is merely a corrupt text or text obscure at this point which has occasioned the difference. The meaning of the name Daniel, put side by side with what we read in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>, 25:39, suggests strongly that it is the right name of the two. It was a name likely to be given by David to his first child by <span class="cmt_word">Abigail</span>. Additional suspicion is thrown on the name Chileab through the three last letters of it, "<span class="accented">leab</span>," constituting also the three first of the very next word," <span class="accented">of Abigail"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) which looks very much like the over-haste of the pen uncorrected. It is remarkable that the Syriac and Arabic versions translate "Caleb," both here and in the parallel passage. For the sons born in Jerusalem we have all three parallel lists at command, and the variations are rather greater. The other two lists are in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>. The first of these omits <span class="cmt_word">Eliphelet</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Nogah</span> (possibly they died young or without issue), and the latter calls Eliphelet <span class="accented">Elpalet</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>). Again, <span class="cmt_word">Shimeah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Elishama</span> in our passage must yield, overruled by the consent of the other two, to Shammuah and Elishua. Again, it is to be noticed that the name <span class="cmt_word">Eliada</span> (God (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), on occasion of its <span class="accented">latest</span> occurence (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>), appears as <span class="accented">Beel</span>iada (the Lord (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), preserving therein probably its <span class="accented">earlier form</span>, viz. that used before a settled bad sense had come to be attached to the word Baal (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.).

Some, however, have taken the Jehoahaz of <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a> for him. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiakim</span> was not the original name of the next brother, but a name slightly altered by Pharaoh-Necho from Eliakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>). If the dates of <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 34, 36</a>, be correct, there is no doubt that, though Jehoiakim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Eliakim, reigned after Jehoahaz, yet he was the elder, and is in his right place in the present passage. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Shallum</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a>) is another name of the Jehoa-haz of <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30, 31, 34</a>, and several other places. It is possible that he finds the last place amid the four brothers of this verse because of his probable usurpation of the throne, in violation of the right of his elder brother, Jehoiakim, and the early fall he met with in consequence. Lastly, that the fourth brother, <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span>, whose name (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>) was originally Mattha-niah, was put on the throne by the King of Babylon, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>) after that his nephew Jehoiachin (who could have no son old enough to succeed) was (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15, 17</a>) carried captive to Babylon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Of the above four brothers, sons of Josiah, the second, Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, had a son called <span class="cmt_word">Jeconiah</span>, or Jehoiachin - essentially the same word. He was eighteen years of age when he succeeded his father (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>). A touching glimpse is given of him in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>. His name is shortened to Coniah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a> and Jeremiah 37:1, though elsewhere in the same prophet, Jeconiah, and in one place (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), Jehoiachin. The name of <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span> occasions difficulty in this verse. In the first instance, following the examples of vers. 10-14, we should presume that this Zedekiah is set forth as a son of Jeconiah, and as it is not said that he <span class="accented">reigned</span> after Jeconiah (for it was undoubtedly Jeconiah's uncle Zedekiah who reigned after him), we need only have read it as a statement of one of his sons. Against this, however, there are two tolerably decisive considerations; for, <span class="accented">first</span>, the verse opens confessedly by offering us <span class="cmt_word">sons of Jehoiakim</span>, and these two, Jeconiah and Zedekiah, will fulfil the promise of that plural; and again, the seventeenth verse enters upon the formal enumeration of <span class="accented">sons to</span> Jeconiah. The question, therefore, returns - Who was this Zedekiah, <span class="accented">son</span> of Jehoiakim? Some consider him identical with the Zedekiah of the previous verse, and that "his son" means here "his successor." This undoes fewer difficulties than it makes. If the text be not corrupt, the likeliest solution is to suppose that this Zedekiah of ver. 16 is an otherwise unknown brother of Jeconiah, and son of Jehoiakim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - These verses contain a line of descent brought down to a point not merely posterior to the Exile, but possibly reaching to the time of Alexander. This line, however, through Solomon is lost so soon as the first name, that of Assir, is passed; Salathiel (Authorized Version)or Shealtiel, being descended from David, not through Solomon, but through Nathan, whole brother to Solomon. This Assir is not known from any parallel passage; and Luther, Starke, Bertheau, and others, followed by Zoekler (in Lange, 'Comm. O.T.') translate the name as <span class="accented">captive</span>, applying it to Jeconiah. Not all their reasons, however, <span class="accented">for</span> this, outweigh one which must be pronounced <span class="accented">against</span> it, viz. the absence of the article. The Septuagint and Vulgate versions agree with our own. The greater probability might be that Assir derived his name from being born after Jeconiah was in captivity, and such passages as <a href="../../par/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>, may throw some light upon the extinction of Solomon's line here, and the transfer of the succession (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/27-11.htm">Numbers 27:11</a>, and see interesting note on the present place in 'Speaker's Commentary'). Salathiel is the Authorized Version incorrect rendering of the Hebrew Shealtiel. In <a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a> it is said, "And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;" and in <a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, "Salathiel, which was <span class="accented">the son</span> of Neri." Now, Neri was in the direct line of Nathan. There seems only one way of reconciling these statements - and the method removes similar difficulties in other places also - viz, to distinguish between the descent <span class="accented">natural</span> and the descent <span class="accented">royal</span>, and then acknowledge that the former was swallowed up, where necessary, of the latter. One as decisive instance of this kind as that before us is most useful to rule other cases. (For an important allusion to the house and family of Nathan's descendants, as well known at the time, see <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a> - a passage probably dating a few years previous to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.), 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">Malchiram also, and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Of the name <span class="cmt_word">Malchiram</span> and five following, it must be left still doubtful whose sons they were - whether of Jeconiah (comp. again <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>) or of Neri as possibly brothers of Salathiel, or of neither of these. The first of these suppositions seems almost untenable, the second seems unlikely enough, and the exceeding prevalence of a corrupt text would strongly favour the third supposition. At the same time, it may be observed that ver. 19 proves that the names must belong to the royal succession, and indicates that, whoever Salathiel was in such aspect, that <span class="cmt_word">Pedaiah</span> was, who becomes father of Zerubbabel. The verses that follow are thought by Eichhorn, Dahler, Keil, and some others to be an interpolation of later date, chiefly on account of the point to which the genealogy is brought. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Pedaiah <i>were</i>, Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Pedaiah is now given as the father of <span class="cmt_word">Zeraubabel</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Shimei</span>. Of the latter of these nothing else is known, unless Lord Hervey's theory below be correct. The former is a great name - its derivation perhaps doubtful. Strictly it signifies "scattered to Babylon," but (Gesenius, 'Lexicon') if the initial part of the word be strengthened into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, the signification might be "born in Babylon." We have in this name another instance of the treatment just commented on with regard to the name Salathiel in <a href="../../par/luke/3-28.htm">Luke 3:28</a>. Zerubbabel is elsewhere invariably described as <span class="accented">son</span> of Salathiel, or Shealtiel; but as the genealogy of St. Luke gives the <span class="accented">natural</span> descent of Salathiel as from Neri, so does our genealogy in this one place give us the natural descent of Zerubbabel as from Pedaiah, one of Salathiel's brothers; while all other passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-12.htm">Haggai 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>)give us that for which the genealogical table is chiefly designed, viz. the matter of <span class="accented">succession</span>, according to which Zerubbabel would be-shown as <span class="accented">son</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> link of succession, following on Shealtiel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span>.

In the Gospel, Hananiah appears as <span class="accented">grandson</span> of Zorobabel, Rhesa intervening. <span class="cmt_word">Shelomith</span>. This person is mentioned here only. The word, though evidently a feminine form, is found for the name of a man, chief of the Izarhites (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-18.htm">1 Chronicles 23:18</a>), but very possibly by a mere clerical error, as the true form is given in the very next chapter (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-22.htm">1 Chronicles 24:22</a>) for the same character, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a></div><div class="verse">And Hashubah, and Ohel, and Berechiah, and Hasadiah, Jushabhesed, five.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The five additional names of this verse must presumably stand apart from the two sons and one daughter of the preceding verse, for some reason. What that reason may be is not known. Perhaps the most natural supposition is that their mother was not the same. The meaning of some of the names, as especially of the last, <span class="cmt_word">Jushab-hesed</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Loving-kindness is returned," has led Bertheau and others to the conjecture that they may be separated as children born to Zerubbabel, one of the leaders of the return from captivity, after that return. This seems plausible, except for the consideration that, the more plausible it is, the more we might expect the explanation itself to have been notified. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-21.htm">1 Chronicles 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Hananiah; Pelatiah, and Jesaiah: the sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, the sons of Obadiah, the sons of Shechaniah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The Hebrew text, followed by the Vulgate, not followed by the Septuagint, reads here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>. Yet some manuscripts have the plural "sons," from which comes our Authorized Version. The indication is important. It is doubly interesting, as the only indication in our Hebrew text that tends to give confirmation to the very noteworthy differences of the Septuagint Version. For although this last, apparently somewhat perversely, begins its version with "sons," which plural does not so well suit its sequel, instead of the "son" of our Hebrew text, which would suit it, yet it proceeds with a translation which must have been obtained from another text, such text again suiting properly the <span class="accented">singular</span> - "son" <span class="accented">-</span> of our Hebrew. The form of its translation is analogous to that marked in the words of vers. 10-14. "The <span class="accented">sons</span> [sic <span class="accented">son</span>] of <span class="cmt_word">Ananiah, Pelatiah</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Jesaiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Rephaiah</span> <span class="accented">his son</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Arnan</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Obadiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Shechaniah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son," making six (presumably) consecutive generations. This, therefore, is the reading which (if correct) might carry down the genealogy to the times of Alexander the Great, and indeed to a time a quarter of a century later. And in doing so, it would certify this entry as of later date than probably any other of the canon! If we reject this position and reading, we have to get over the term, repeated several times, <span class="cmt_word">the sons of</span>. To do this, Bertheau <span class="accented">suggests</span> that the intention of our passage was, from the name Rephaiah inclusive, not to mention the individual four brothers' names, but to mention them as four distinguished families among the posterity of David - an attempt at explanation certainly not satisfactory. The conclusion of the matter <span class="accented">is</span>, that in this twenty-first verse we have difficulties in either alternative, not satisfactorily explained. Either we have the names in all of six brothers, being "<span class="accented">sons</span> of Hananiah" - the last four of whom are styled, not by their individual names, but as heads of families; or we have six lineal descendants from Hananiah. If this last supposition were correct, calculate a royal <span class="accented">succession</span> at the lowest average (say something under twenty years), and the genealogy, including what follows in the remaining verses of the chapter, will bring <span class="accented">us</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> above, to a date that covers the whole life of Alexander the Great. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Shechaniah; Shemaiah: and the sons of Shemaiah; Hattush, and Igeal, and Bariah, and Neariah, and Shaphat, six.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - In the obscurity that obtains on the subject, there is one somewhat bright star of light in a succeeding name, <span class="cmt_word">Hattush</span>, to which this verse leads us. This verse purports to help on the line of genealogy by a contribution of two descents, the effective names being <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Neariah</span>, the line coming to its close by aid of two other effective names, <span class="accented">Elioenai</span> and (say) <span class="accented">Hodaiah</span>, contained in the last two verses of the chapter. Although one manifest error in ver. 22 (involved in the number "six" when only five sons have been read) betokens the insecurity of the text, yet the summary measures of the ingenious Lord A. C. Hervey (see his valuable work on the 'Genealogies of our Lord Jesus Christ,' pp. 103, 307, 322; and articles in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:666, 667) can scarcely be warranted, when he wishes <span class="accented">first</span> to omit altogether the words <span class="cmt_word">and the sons of Shecaniah; Shemaiah</span>; and <span class="accented">next</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> regard Shemaiah as Shimei, the brother of Zerub-babel, and, as matter of course, those who followed as the descendants of this brother of Zerubbabel, instead of Zerubbabel himself. Now, a passage in the Book of Ezra helps us much here. Ezra mentions, as one of those of the "sons of David" who went up with him from Babylon to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2, 3</a>), Hattush, "of the sons of Shechaniah." There is not only nothing to prevent this Hattush being the same as the elder brother of Neariah, who comes fourth in succession from Zerubbabel (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the hypothesis that the six names of ver. 21 are brothers, not a line of descents), but at the above-mentioned average of twenty years the dates will admirably synchronize - the last date of Zerubbabel being about  <span class="date">B.C. 520</span>, and that of Neariah  <span class="date">B.C. 440</span>; while the date of Ezra's journey was  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span> (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' 3:186, 187). This coincidence of names and dates must not be regarded as con-elusive; but, pending further discovery, it strongly disfavours the idea of the names of ver. 21 constituting a succession, and it keeps well in check the rate of succeeding generations, bringing the last member of the succession to a date that may be harmonized with others which have for the most part held their ground. That in ver. 22 only five names are given for what are summed up as "<span class="accented">six</span>," must lead to the supposition that one has dropped out; and since no known manuscript of the Hebrew text, nor the Septuagint or Vulgate versions supplies us with the missing name, the Syriac and Arabic versions, which supply the name Azariah between Neariah and Shaphat, must be viewed with some suspicion. <span class="cmt_word">Igeal</span> is, in the Hebrew, a word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>) identical with the Igal of <a href="../../par/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-36.htm">2 Samuel 23:36</a> - Septuagint in the latter passages <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bb;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;</span>, but in the present place <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. Of the other persons in this verse little or nothing else is known.

Lord A. C.
