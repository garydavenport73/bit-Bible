Our present verse evidently continues both the subject and construction of that verse. Of the four sons (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>), two died without issue, viz. Nadab and Abihu (ver. 2); and the other two have to supply the "chief men of the house," viz.

This is virtually repeated in vers. 6, 31 (see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a> for an analogous case). For the "Ahimelech" of this verse and vers. 6, 31, should be read "Abiathar," as shown in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, by comparison of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a>.

The <span class="cmt_word">governors</span>; read rather, <span class="accented">the princes.</span> The distinction intended between "the holy princes," or "princes of the sanctuary," on the one hand, and "the princes of God" on the other, is not very clear. One instance of the former expression is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>. Keil supposes there may be no distinction between them, but adds that if there is, he would take the "princes of God" to stand for the regular high priests exclusively, viz. those who could enter into the most holy place before God. The "princes of God" is a title evidently illustrated by the word "Israel" (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>).

The present Hebrew text repeats the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5d6;</span> (taken) twice, before the name of Ithamar, at the end of the sentence. The evident and easy correction of the first occurrence of which into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> (one) will make the clause and sense correspond with what goes before. Bertheau, however, and Keil, and some others do not accept this correction, and would keep the present Hebrew text, the first-named, moreover, contending that the repetition of the word for "taking" points to two lots being represented by each house of Ithamar, whose total number was only eight, for one of Eleazar, whose total was sixteen. Not only does the repetition of the present Hebrew text not avail to authorize such a supposition, but the supposition itself would be unsupported and gratuitous. What is really told us amounts to this only, that the drawing was first from the collection of families under the name of Eleazar, and then from that descended from Ithamar. For anything we are here told, the urn of Ithamar can have held out only half as long as that of Eleazar, and it can be only conjecture to suppose that two lots were drawn from the urn of Eleazar for every one from that of Ithamar, so as to make them run out together at the end. Could any one of the names from sixteen to twenty-four that are recorded in this chapter as "coming forth" in the shape of a "lot," be identified as belonging to families descended from Ithamar, the question might be solved. <span class="cmt_word">Ahimelech the son of Abiathar</span>; read, as above, ver. 3, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, etc., <span class="accented">Abiathar the son of Abimelech.</span>

In <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a>, moreover, the names do not appear as even twenty-four, but twenty-two - deficient by two! - a thing most easily to be accounted for.

These, of course, do not exhaust the whole of the non-priestly Levites; for we read distinctly in the following two chapters of other detachments of the non-priestly Levites, whose office was as singers, doorkeepers, and treasure-keepers. And this consideration may of itself possibly be a sufficient account of the absence of any of the family of Gershonites in the list of the present chapter, though they do appear to view for other work in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-21.htm">1 Chronicles 26:21</a>, etc. Amram...  Shubael. The latter of these two names marks the line of Moses, in his eider son, Gershon, whose son was Shebuel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-15.htm">1 Chronicles 23:15, 16</a>), as the former is the name of the father of Moses, and <span class="accented">eldest</span> son of Kohath.

This name marks the line of Moses, in the person of his younger son, Eliezer, father of Rehabiah. And the practical result of these two verses is to give us the two "chiefs," or heads, or representatives, <span class="cmt_word">Jehdeiah and Isshiah</span>, both Amramites.

This Jahath furnishes for us the third name of this series of "other sons of Levi." And Keil plausibly argues, from the absence of these three names from the list of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6, 23</a>, that, while that list is occupied with fathers' houses, this list is occupied with the official classes of the Levites who were to be engaged in the way already stated.

What is necessary to fill up the evident gaps is to be found, however, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-19.htm">1 Chronicles 23:19</a>; also the pointed allusion to the time of David, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-31.htm">1 Chronicles 26:31</a>, is deserving of especial notice. The four names of this verse, then, are descendants of Kohath's <span class="accented">third</span> son, Hebron (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-12.htm">1 Chronicles 23:12</a>).

In all these fourteen heads were drawn from the four sons of Kohath.

For the oft-repeated <span class="cmt_word">Mahli</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Mushi</span>, they belonged to the time of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-19.htm">Exodus 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33</a>). The elder of these, <span class="accented">Mahli</span>, as already seen in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-21.htm">1 Chronicles 23:21, 22</a>, had two sons, Eleazar and Kish, the sons of the latter of whom took the daughters of Eleazar, who had no sons, and thus kept only one house surviving, the head of which was (ver. 29) <span class="cmt_word">Jerahmeel</span>. This would seem to complete all that needs to be said of the Mahli line. Meantime, however, we are confronted by the contents of the latter half of our ver. 26 and ver. 27. These purport to give, amid some confusion of expression, sons of <span class="cmt_word">Merari by Jaaziah his son</span> (<span class="accented">Beno</span>). No anterior authority, however, can be found for this <span class="cmt_word">Jaaziah</span>. Neither of him nor of any of the three names (omitting <span class="accented">Beno</span>, which is evidently to be translated "his son") here linked on to his, is anything known. While we accept the text as it at present is, we have an additional branch with three families to add to the account of Merari - the branch of <span class="cmt_word">Jaaziah</span>, the three families of <span class="cmt_word">Shoham</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Zaeeur, Ibri</span>. Even so we have in ver. 27 to obliterate arbitrarily the conjunction <span class="accented">van</span>, prefixed to the name Shoham. Under these circumstances, Keil impatiently rejects these clauses altogether, as an interpolation, though one of which he can give no account, and adds up, in consequence, the families of Levi (exclusive of the priests) to twenty-two instead of the unexplained twenty-five of the present text. On the other hand, Bertheau retains the present reading, and accepts Jaaziah as a third branch of the family of Merari. If this were so, it is surprising that nowhere else is room found for the slightest mention of Jaaziah, nor any other mention of these supposed descendants.

It is to be observed that, in the foregoing verses, we have no expressed sum of the families or heads to which they add up. Hence Bertheau finds twenty-five in all, which he would reduce to the twenty-four he wants by omitting, without any adequate justificacation, the Mahli of ver. 30. Others, omitting the three names of Shoham, Zaccur, Ibri, bring the twenty-five to twenty-two. Keil finds only fifteen "heads" or "classes," but surmises that the Hebronite and Mushite "fathers' houses" may have been numerous enough to find more than one "class;" and thereby to make up the twenty-four classes which he desires as well for symmetry's sake as for the patent suggestions of ver. 31.
