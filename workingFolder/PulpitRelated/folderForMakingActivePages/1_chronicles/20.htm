There we read more particularly that Joab sent word he had taken the "city of waters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the lower part of the city (where a stream had its source, and no doubt supplied the city with water), which was very likely the key of the whole position,and called upon David to come up and "encamp against the city and take it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the city, or citadel, which stood upon the heights north of the stream. Glimpses of this kind may suffice to convince us how rapidly a text, really correct, would melt away for us a very large proportion of the whole number of the lesser obstacles which often impede our path in the historical books of the Old Testament. At the time that kings go out. It was no doubt the case that, even in Palestine, the winter was often a period of enforced inactivity. Rabbah. Tim punishment of Ammou for the treatment of David's well-intended embassy of condolence is now about to be completed. The familiar root of Rabbah signifies multitudinous number, and, resulting thence, the greatness of importance. It was the chief city of the Ammonites, if not their only city of importance enough for mention. In five passages its connection with Ammon is coupled with its name (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>), "Rabbah of the children of Ammon." It has been conjectured to be the <span class="accented">Ham</span> of the Zuzim, or the Ashteroth Karnaim of the Rephaim (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>), of which latter theory there is some interesting evidence of a corroborating tendency at all events (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:985). Rabbah is the proper spelling of the word, except when in a constructive state, as in the above phrase. The relations of Moab and Ammon with Israel are full of interest. After the overthrow of Og, King of Bashan (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>), "Moab and Ammon still remained independent allies south and cast of the Israelite settlements. Both fell before David  - Moab, evidently the weaker, first; Ammon not without a long resistance, which made the siege and fall of its capital, Rabbah-ammon, the crowning act of David's conquests. The ruins which now adorn the 'royal city' are of a later Roman date; but the commanding position of the citadel remains; and the unusual sight of a living stream abounding in fish (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-27.htm">2 Samuel 12:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>) marks the significance of Joab's song of victory, 'I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters'" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' 323, edit. 1866). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-2.htm">1 Chronicles 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i>there were</i> precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Found it to weigh a talent of gold</span>. Two difficulties present themselves in this verse, viz. the reported weight of this crown, and the uncertainty as to what head it was from which David took it. Whatever was its weight, if David's head was able to sustain it for a minute or two, the head of the King of the Ammonites might also occasionally have borne it. Yet it would scarcely be likely that the King of the Ammonites would have so ponderous a crown (calculated at a weight of a hundred and fourteen pounds Troy, or a little more or less than one hundredweight) as one of ordinary wear, or that he would have one of extraordinary wear on his head precisely at such a juncture. Both of these difficulties will remove if we suppose that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, instead of meaning <span class="cmt_word">their king</span>, is the name of the Ammonitish and Moabitish idol (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> Moloch), and which we find (Authorized Version) in <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably (though not Authorized Version) in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>, and <a href="../../par/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. The Septuagint treats the word thus. The point, however, cannot be considered settled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he brought out the people that <i>were</i> in it, and cut <i>them</i> with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut them</span> with <span class="cmt_word">saws</span> (so <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>). We have here the very doubtful (so far as regards its real signification) Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (and he cut) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (he put). Probably it is nowhere else used in the sense of "cutting," if it is here. Its ordinary sense is to rule or put into subjection. The parallel place (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>) corrects, in the word (Authorized Version) <span class="accented">axes</span>, our Hebrew text, which repeats the word for saw, though putting it in the plural, and which thereby shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. This last word means "Axes" or "scythes," and is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;</span>, to cut (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-4.htm">2 Kings 6:4</a>). It is found only in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>, though it should appear here also. There is a fourth severity of punishment mentioned in the parallel place, that the people were "made to pass through the brick-kilns," a form of torture possibly suggested by the own familiar cruelty of the Ammonites in "making their children to pass through the fire to Moloch." However, in harmony with what is above said respecting the doubtfulness of the just signification of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, much uncertainty hangs over the interpretation of this verse. Instead of severity and needless cruelty on the part of David, it may rather set forth that he <span class="accented">subjected</span> them to hard tasks in connection with the cultivation of the soil and with the making of bricks. The saws and harrows and axes (or scythes) were awkward and unlikely weapons to be employed for the purpose of inflicting torture, when the ordinary weapons of battle and warfare were close at hand. This view, however, is contrary to the verdict, so far as the above Hebrew verb is concerned, of Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' p. 1326, and of Thenins, on this and the parallel passage. When such punishments were of the nature of torture, the cruelty was in some cases extreme. "The criminal was sometimes sawn asunder lengthwise; this was more especially the practice in Persia. Isaiah, according to the Talmud-isis, was put to death in this wise by King Manasseh, 'Sanhedrin,' p. 103, c. 2; comp. Justin's dialogue with Trypho" (Jahn's 'Sacred Antiquities,' p. 132, &sect; 260, 7.). <span class="accented">With saws.</span> The word in the original is not in the plural. It occurs again only in the parallel place (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>) and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-9.htm">1 Kings 7:9</a>, both times in the singular. The teeth of Eastern saws then and now usually incline to the handle instead of from it. With harrows of iron. The only <span class="accented">harrow</span> known to have been used at this time consisted of a thick block of wood borne down by a weight, or on which a man sat, drawn over the ploughed land by oxen (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/job/39-10.htm">Job 39:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>), and the root of the Hebrew word expresses the idea of crushing or levelling the land. But our present word is very different, and is found only here and in the parallel place, with the word "iron" accompanying it, so as to be equivalent to a compound word, and appears to mean "sharp instruments of iron," or sharp threshing instruments. The use of the former part of this phrase (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>) for <span class="accented">cheeses</span> is the only other instance of its occurrence. <span class="accented">Saws</span> should be "axes," or "scythes," as stated above, though it is not any of the three more ordinary words for "axe" (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:142).

The Hebrew word for "giant," <span class="accented">rapha</span> (always in these verses spelt with a final <span class="accented">aleph</span>, but in the parallel verses always with <span class="accented">he</span> final), is here (Authorized Version) translated.

There is a strange confusion in the reading of this and its parallel verse. If our present verse is to stand corrected by accepting from its parallel "the Bethlehemite" in place of our <span class="accented">Lamhi</span>, then either we have no name given for the brother of Goliath, the Gittite; or, if we drop the word "brother" (changing the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> of Chronicles into the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> of Samuel), and make Goliath the Gittite the man slain by Elhanan, then of such a Goliath we know nothing, and it is a most unlikely coincidence of name with the conquered of David's sling.. Kennicott's seventy-eighth dissertation is occupied, and ably, with the <span class="accented">pros</span> and <span class="accented">cons</span> of this question; and the curiosities of Jerome on the passage may be found in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae.'

Still this, it may justly be argued, may have been the very reason of the form of expression here chosen, coupling David's work and that of his servants.
