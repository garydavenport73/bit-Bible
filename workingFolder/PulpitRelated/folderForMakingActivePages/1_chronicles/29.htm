The additional expression here is to be noticed, <span class="cmt_word">whom alone God hath chosen</span>. By this plea, full of truth as it was, we may suppose that David would shelter himself from any possible blame or reflection on the part of the people, from the charge of partiality on the part of his elder children, and any unjust slight to them, and also from any <span class="accented">self-reproach</span>, in that he was devolving such a responsible task on so <span class="cmt_word">young and tender</span> a man. <span class="cmt_word">Palace</span>.

The word is found also in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; but there it carries the signification of the fortress of the temple.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Even</i> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses <i>withal</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Respecting the uncertainty of the amounts here denoted, even if the numbers of the present text be accepted as correct, see note on 1 Chronicles 22:14. Bertheau and Keil make <span class="cmt_word">three thousand talents of gold</span> the equivalent of thirteen millions and a half of our money, and <span class="cmt_word">seven thousand talents of silver</span> the equivalent of two and a half millions of our money - or, if the royal shekel instead of the sacred be supposed to be the standard, they make them the half of those two amounts respectively. Others calculate the value of the gold to reach thirty millions, and of the silver three millions of our money (see Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., pp. 63-65, 81). The situation of Ophir is still considered undetermined. The other occasions on which it is mentioned are as follows: - <a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-23.htm">1 Chronicles 1:23</a>); <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>. It must be understood also that it is to it that allusion is made in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>, where we read that silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks, beside the gold, were imported into Judaea from it. The "almug" tree is also said to have been brought in the same ships which brought the gold of Ophir. The Septuagint always translates by some form of the word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (except in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>), which word comes very near the Coptic name for India. There is also a place in India, mentioned by Ptolemy, Ammianus, and Abulfeda, the site of the present <span class="accented">emporium</span> of Goa, called <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and which would explain Both the Hebrew and the Septuagint words. An Indian site for Ophir would also well suit the mention of the ivory and the particular wood which the ships brought. On the other hand, the first occasion of this name Ophir finds it placed among the tribes of <span class="accented">Joktan's</span> descendants, who occupied South Arabia. It is there (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-23.htm">1 Chronicles 1:23</a>) placed between Sheba and Havilah, beth abounding in gold. There are other considerations that favour Arabia. Many other places have been suggested, and some of them supported by respectable authorities, such as Eastern Africa, South America and Peru, Phrygia, etc. If there be a real question about it, to the prejudice of Arabia, it would be to India we must look. That some of the commodities brought belonged more especially to India, though even in that case the majority belonged undoubtedly to Arabia, is very true. This circumstance throws great probability into the suggestion that whether Ophir were in Arabia or India, it was a great <span class="accented">emporium</span>, and not simply an exporter of its own particular produce (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>; Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The last sentence of this verse certainly says that the destined use of the <span class="cmt_word">refined silver</span>, as well as of the <span class="cmt_word">gold of Ophir, was to overlay the walls of the houses</span>. We know that gold was used for this purpose (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-5.htm">2 Chronicles 3:5-10</a>). But we do not read of the silver being used for <span class="accented">overlaying</span> purposes. We also read that none of the drinking-vessels of Solomon were of <span class="accented">silver</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> "it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>). It is possible, the order of the-sentences notwithstanding, that the mention of the <span class="accented">refined silver</span> is only to pro-pare the way for the contents of ver. 5, and that it mast not be applied to the last sentence of our present verse.

It includes adoration, acknowledgment of the inherent nature of human dependence, self-humiliation, and confession, dedication of all the offerings, and prayer both for the whole people in general, and for Solomon in particular, in view of his future position and responsibilities. Its utter repudiation of all idea of meritoriousness is very striking. The traces are visible of what may be called snatches of memory on the part of David from various religious odes of his own authorship, as well as from those of others still on record, as, for instance, especially in vers. 14-17, compared with passages in <a href="../../par/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89, </a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>; and 139. But the unity of this service is abundantly conspicuous, and every sentence seems weighed and measured for the occasion. The scene, reaching its climax in what is recorded in ver. 20, must have been one of the utmost religious grandeur and impressiveness. It is true that the very last clause, which couples the reverence done on the part of the assembled multitude to the king, with that done to Jehovah himself, strikes us as an unfortunate conjunction. It does not, indeed, need upon its merits any vindication, considering the tenor of all which has preceded; but it may be felt an extenuation of the form in which the expression occurs, if we suppose (as we justly may) that the people viewed their act in the light of part of their religious service at that particular time. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a> the same words express the reverence paid to David, though in numerous other passages they mark that offered to God (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>).

This latter expression is more forcible than the former. The <span class="cmt_word">second time</span> of making Solomon king is explained by <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a>. The statement that <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span> was anointed to be <span class="cmt_word">priest</span> must probably be understood to describe, either the re-anointing of him (just as "they made Solomon king the second time") on an occasion which particularly invited it; or an anointing which had not been before fully performed. This latter is, perhaps, an unlikely supposition; but at the same time, the fact of any previous ceremony of the kind does not happen to be narrated. Zadok had been joint priest with Abiatbar of the line of Ithamar (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>, 29; 19:11); but now he was anointed under circumstances of special publicity, and at a crisis of special interest, to supersede Abiathar. who had sided with Adonijah, and who was early to be removed altogether from the sacred office (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7, 8, 32, 38, 44, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>).

A uniform rendering for all might be found in the general word "history" or "acts." The question as to the probable nature of these works, and whether identical with our Books of Samuel, has been treated of in the Introduction. The Hebrew word for "seer," applied in this verse to Samuel, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>.

There can be no doubt that the word applied to Samuel would, under any circumstances, stand as the higher of the two names, were there any comparison intended between them. This is confirmed by the fact that it is found used only of him (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9, 11, 18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-28.htm">1 Chronicles 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>) and of Hanani (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7, 10</a>), whereas the word applied to Gad in this verse is the <span class="accented">generic</span> name for seers, and is used several times in the Books of Chronicles of other persons than Gad. At the same time, the parenthesis in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>, to the effect that the word here used of Samuel as seer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) was superseded in later times (as, for instance, at the time of the writing of the Books of Samuel) by the word prophet (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), compared with <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>, points in a somewhat different direction. In the first place, it would indicate that our Authorized Version in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a> should rather stand, "Which say to the prophets, Prophesy not, and to the seers," etc. While for our present passage it would indicate that no insidious comparison is possible between Samuel and Gad as seers, but rather that Samuel retains the old honoured name by which he had been wont to be called, and that to <span class="accented">Nathan</span> is with equal naturalness attached the more modern name - the functions represented being essentially the same, or at least analogous.
