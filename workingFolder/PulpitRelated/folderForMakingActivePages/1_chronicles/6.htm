He was one of the travellers with Jacob into Egypt, was probably about twenty years the junior of Joseph, lived thirty years after his death, and attained the age of one hundred and thirty-three years, after a residence in Egypt of about one hundred and fifteen years in all. The Kohathites are expressly mentioned in their sacred duties in the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-8</a>), and in the time of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-12.htm">2 Chronicles 29:12-14</a>). The four sons of Kohath are next instanced, in order to get another step nearer the clear beginning of the priest line.

It has been pointed out by Lord A. C. Hervey that the name Jehozadak is of the same meaning with Zedekiah, the last king before the Captivity; and that Jeshua is the same in meaning with Joshua, the leader of the tribes into Canaan. The two elder brothers of Eleazar, viz. Nadab and Abihu, died without issue (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-28.htm">Numbers 20:28</a>; ch. 24:1-3). It is somewhat obscurely said that the sacred office remained in the family of Eleazar till, in the person of Eli, it passed awhile into that of Ithamar, his brother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>; Josephus, 8:1, &sect; 3), to be recovered again in the Zadok of our ver. 9 (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Phinehas</span>; a memorable man (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-13</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-33</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30, 31</a>; which Grove well compares with <a href="../../par/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abishua</span>; only mentioned in this chapter and <a href="../../par/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1-5</a>. Josephus (8:1, &sect; 3) asserts that he it was who was succeeded in the high priesthood, not by any one of his own descendants, but by Eli, till Zedok, in the time of David, all the intervening members of the Eleazar family being private individuals. But no reliance can be placed on this assertion, for see Josephus again (5:11, &sect; 5).

Lightfoot ('Temple Service,' 4. &sect; 1) supposes that the change of priesthood family to Ithamar took place after Meraioth. But it is just as probable that the gap between Abishua and Eli, or possibly even between Phinehas and Eli, was filled by holders of the high priest office unknown by name to us.

With this name begins the light again. Ahitub, Zadok, Ahimaaz, and Azariah are of frequent mention in the Books of Samuel and Kings. Ahitub, here and elsewhere plainly given as father of Zadok, seems to be given as father of Meraioth in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>, and grandfather of Zadok; and in both passages is termed "ruler of the house of God" - an expression probably equivalent to high priest, as Azariah, high priest in the reign of Hezekiah, is also so described (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-13.htm">2 Chronicles 31:13</a>). The recurrence of the two names Ahitub and Zadok in vers. 11 and 12 is very possibly the result of some error; and it is in favour of such a supposition, in some form of it, at all events, that in that place, where, including Shallum (or Meshullam), only three steps are found, several more seem to be required - the period one of some one hundred and eighty years, and filled in the list of Judah's kings by as many as nine in succession. On the other hand, it is open to question whether the recurrence of the names Ahitub and Zadok be not legitimate. And this may then be the solution of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>, as above, with their insertion of Meraioth  - still other names being absent which would make up the requisite number of generations. <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span>. The earliest glimpse we get of him is in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-28.htm">1 Chronicles 12:28</a>, where he is introduced as "a young man mighty of valour," who now casts in his lot with David at Hebron, on Saul's death. In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24, 29, 35</a>, we find him and Abiathar the recognized priests. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7, 8</a>, we find him true to David when Abiathar joined Adonijah - the punishment of the latter and the reward of the former being recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27, 35</a>, respectively. Up to that time it is evident. that Abiathar had precedence in rank over Zadok. His death is not recorded, but it must be assigned to a date previous to the dedication of the temple, from the account of which (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>.) his name is entirely absent. The last allusions to him are in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-2.htm">1 Kings 4:2, 4</a>; in the latter of which verses (specially coupled as the name is with the deposed Abiathar) the notice is probably as merely <span class="accented">historical as</span> it certainly is in the former. This same verse states that Azariah was "the priest," and that he was son, <span class="accented">i.q.</span> grandson, of Zadok, proving, with very little doubt, that the explanatory parenthesis of our ver. 10 should follow the Azariah mentioned in the <span class="accented">previous</span> verse.

Again, this Azariah must not be identified with him of the time of King Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17, 20</a>), who must have been nearly a century later, and was contemporary with Isaiah, Joel, and Amos.

The latter half of ver. 19, according to the Hebrew, should rather refer to what has preceded, and be a "subscription," though it might best suit the connection to regard it as introducing what was to follow, and as being a "superscription."

The question is whether this list of seven is part of the longer list of thirteen from Gershom (vers. 39-43). terminating with Asaph; and it seems impossible to decide the question satisfactorily. From the occurrence of the name Shimei in this latter, though in the wrong place, viz. after Jahath in the descending order, instead of before him, some think, Keil and Zockler among them, that it is a line from Shimei, the <span class="accented">brother</span> of Libni, and second son of Gershom. If this be so, the occurrence of three names, the same and in the same order, is a thing to be remarked, though possible enough in itself.

But the descendants now to he spoken of are through another son, here called Am-minadab, a name not appearing among the four of ver. 2, but apparently standing for the Izhar of that verse.

This Heman is to be distinguished from Heman the "son of Zerah" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>), and with but little doubt, therefore, from Heman the Ezrahite (Zerahite) of <a href="../../par/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>. On the other hand, a theory has been suggested by Lord Arthur C. Hervey which might reconcile the two. He supposes that if Heman the Kohathite (or his father) had married an heiress of the house of Zerah, he might have become reckoned in the line of Zerah as well as in that of Kohath.
