There can surely be little doubt that it is the river Nile which is here spoken of, after comparison of the following passages: - <a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>.

Hamath was one of the great cities of the Orontes valley, in Upper Syria, which formed the boundary in especial of the empire of Solomon. This valley is watered by the Orontes, the river of Antioch, a river remarkable for its abundant spring (situate immediately north of the source of the Leontes), which won for it the name, among all the other springs of Syria, of "The Spring," and remarkable for "the length of its course, the volume of its waters, and the rich vegetation of its banks." It is <span class="accented">the</span> one of the four rivers which take their rise beneath the heights of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon which becomes really worthy of the name of river, the other three, viz. the Jordan, the Leontes or modern <span class="accented">Litany</span> of Phoeicia, and the Abana or modern <span class="accented">Barada</span> of Damascus, more resembling the nature of the mountain stream. This river was to the ancient Romans "the representative of Syria, as the Timings might be said to be of England, and in later times the region formed the chief point of contact between this part of Asia and the West" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 414, <span class="accented">e</span>,<span class="accented">f</span>, edit. 1866). The <span class="accented">kingdom</span> of Hamath comprised the tract of this valley of the Orontes, skirted by the hills separating the Leontes from the Orontes, and extending to the Pass of Daphne below Antioch. <span class="accented">Riblah</span> (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>) lies on the east bank of the Orontes, thirty-five miles north-east of Baal-bek, or Baal-gad. The people of Hamath were of the race of Ham, of the descendants of Canaan (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), and are not to be reckoned as of Phoenician origin.

We read in <a href="../../par/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17-27</a> how the men of Kirjath-jearim had been made by Joshua "hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord." Hither to this Kirjath-jearim the ark had been conveyed from Bethshemesh (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>), and here it "abode" long time, "for it was twenty years." Perhaps the word "abode" in this passage may be equivalent to abode <span class="accented">unmoved</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>.18, 19). For though the chronology from the death of Eli, through the remainder of Samuel's career and of Saul's, seems almost hopelessly uncertain, yet it would appear certain that the interval exceeded twenty years, to the time that David now takes in hand to bring home, as it were, the ark. <span class="cmt_word">The ark of God, the Lord</span>. Though the Authorized Version of this passage is better and cleverer than that of the parallel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>), yet it is left somewhat obscure. The comma should follow the name God. Jehovah sitting upon the cherubim then follows as a clause in apposition, while the last three words (<span class="accented">as the name is called</span>, rather than whose name) state that clause to contain "the Name of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-8.htm">1 Samuel 6:8</a>).

For Chidon, the parallel place has <span class="accented">Nachon</span>; possibly these are two names of the same place, or one form is a corruption of the ether; but there is nothing to determine for us which.
