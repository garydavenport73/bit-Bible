It is the place of <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> which disturbs the fittest order, and Keil suggests that his place in this text is accounted for by Rachel's desire that her handmaid's child should be accounted her own; but surely this was not exceptional, but applied to all or most of such cases, and should have been far rather taken into consideration in any of the other lists than in this. However accounted for, the order is - <span class="accented">lest</span>, the six sons of the first wife Leah; <span class="accented">secondly</span>, the elder son of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah; <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, the two sons of the loved wife Rachel; <span class="accented">fourthly</span>, the other son of Rachel's handmaid Billah; <span class="accented">lastly</span>, the two sons of Zilpah, handmaid of Leah. As this order corresponds with nothing in our Old Testament, it may serve as one slight indication that the compiler of Chronicles was not dependent on these records alone. The Hebrew text and the Septuagint accord exactly with the Authorized Version here.

There all these names are found in exact accord in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint. The Septuagint Version, however (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-2.htm">Genesis 38:2</a>), by an evident inaccuracy of translation, gives Shua as the name, not of the father, but of the daughter, <span class="greek">&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;</span>.

Er and Onan died without issue, and the descendants of <span class="accented">Shelah</span> are not mentioned till we reach <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-21.htm">1 Chronicles 4:21-23</a>.

If these last four names are not identical with those in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>, they are not to be found in any available connection elsewhere, and the last two not at all. Upon this supposition, it is held by some that this very passage proves that the compiler drew on resources not possessed by us. The weight of evidence seems, however, largely in favour of the persons being the same. (See Gilbert Barrington's 'Old Testament Genealogies,' 1:206-208, well summarized in art. "Darda," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' for as competent a discussion of the question as the present data will allow.) It needs to be constantly remembered that an enumeration like the above, of five so-called <span class="accented">sons</span>, does not necessarily involve their being five <span class="accented">brothers</span>, although in this case it looks the more as though they were so, as it is said <span class="cmt_word">five of them in all</span>

The missing son, any way, belongs to the seventh place. The Syriac and Arabic versions have taken the Elihu of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-18.htm">1 Chronicles 27:18</a>, and put him in this place. Others, following the Septuagint, suppose this Elihu, if strictly a brother of David, to be Eliab, the oldest. The explanation of the absence of the name here may be that he died early and without issue, and would accordingly be the less wanted in a genealogical register.

Light is thrown upon this by <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>, which says that Abigail was the daughter of one Nahash, and that Zeruiah was her sister. But it is to leave us in greater darkness as to who Nahath was: whether Nahath was another name for Jesse, or the name of Jesse's wife, or the name of a former husband of Jesse's wife, to whom she bore these two daughters before she became wife to Jesse, and that former husband possibly none other than the Ammonite king (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>) - or whether none of these conjectures be near the truth, some of which on the face of them seem unlikely enough, is as yet unsettled. Meantime it is worth remembering that Zeruiah named one of her celebrated sons, and probably the eldest of them, <span class="cmt_word">Abishai</span>, after Jesse, Ishai being the same as our Jesse; yet from the above premises it is taken that she was strictly sister of Abigail, and therefore was not really related to Jesse. The subject is treated interestingly under the various names in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary.' The husband of Zeruiah is given nowhere, while the husband of Abigail, here called <span class="cmt_word">Jether the Ishmeelite</span>, is, in the passage already referred to (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>), called Ithra (which is a slightly altered form of the name), an <span class="accented">Israelite</span>, with little doubt an error for <span class="accented">Ishmaelite.</span> In the same passage also her own name appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, though many manuscripts have this latter.

The descendants of <span class="cmt_word">Caleb</span> (Chelubai), placed third of Hezron's sons, are next dealt with; but the subject is almost immediately interrupted by resumed reference to <span class="cmt_word">Hezron</span> (vers. 21-24), and by the table of Jemh-meel and his descendants (vers. 25-41); after which the table of Caleb, apparently the same Caleb, is carried on (vers. 42-49). Taking these broken portions, however, just as they come, we are immediately met by a series of uncertainties and surprises. Ver. 18 is obscure in that it says Caleb had children by <span class="cmt_word">Azubah</span> (the Hebrew construction also unusual), a <span class="cmt_word">wife</span>, or indeed strictly a <span class="accented">woman</span> (not even using the ordinary formula "his wife"), and by <span class="cmt_word">Jerioth</span>, of whom nothing is said; and the verse adds obscurity by saying, her sons are these, without plainly indicating to which woman reference is made. It may be safely presumed, however, from what follows, that Azubah is intended, though no other part of Scripture helps us By so much as a mention of the sons' names to determine it certainly. Meantime one Hebrew manuscript and the Chaldee Paraphrase are found to omit the words "and by Jerioth." The Vulgate, and the Syriac and Arabic versions, make Jerioth one of the <span class="accented">children -</span> possibly a daughter - of Caleb and Azubah, and this view is supported by Kennicott and Houbigant (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). The tone of ver. 19 may certainly he held to offer some countenance to the assumption that either Jerioth's name ought to appear as that of a child or not at all. The name <span class="cmt_word">Ephrath</span> in this verse abounds with interest. The ancient name of the town of Bethlehem, and also apparently of a district round it, is the same word which is found here as the name of a woman. In either case it is more generally written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as even in the two other appearances of it in this very chapter.

The mother Ephrath is here interesting for her descendants given, her son <span class="cmt_word">Hur</span>, grandson <span class="cmt_word">Uri</span>, and great-grandson <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel</span>.

Two sons of Hezron by Abiah are given (the latter of them a posthumous child), but the elder having a son called <span class="cmt_word">Jair</span> tracked, no doubt as one who became famous by the number of cities he took. He was thus connected on the father's side with a great family of Judah, and on the mother's with a great family of Manasseh.

Evident stress is laid on his maternal descent. Thus (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>) he is styled son of Manasseh, and hence also the explanation of the last clause of ver. 23, <span class="accented">infra</span>, all these belonged to <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Machir the father of Gilead</span>.

They lay in the trans-Jordanic district Trachonitis, the modern El-leyah and Jebel-Hauran. It is not possible to harmonize exactly the numbers of the cities given here with those in passages quoted above; nor is the translation of ver. 23, Authorized Version, very certainly the correct one. E. Bertheau, in his 'Die Bucher der Chronik erklart; 15. Kurzgef. exegetisches Handbuch. z. A.T.,' translates, "And Geshur and Aram took the Havvoth-Jair from them with Kenath and her daughter-towns, sixty cities." "Took" is supposed to mean here "retook," or "recovered." Though this suits the Hebrew syntax better, it does not suit so well our immediate context; nor have we any other information of such re, covering of them.

This reading of the Vulgate has suggested to others that by a slight but still gratuitous alteration of our Hebrew text <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> might be substituted for the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to the name of Caleb; but upon <span class="accented">that</span> showing we have to <span class="accented">suppose</span> that Caleb did leave Egypt on his own account and travel to Ephratah, and then there fails any strong connection (but see Septuagint, in <span class="accented">loc.</span>) between that fact and what is said about <span class="cmt_word">Abiah</span>. Still, the explanation might receive some countenance from the fact that it is said that Abiah's son became the father - or <span class="accented">founder - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tekoa</span>, a place near Bethlehem, in South Judah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). Bertheau has at this point suggested that Caleb-ephratah, instead of being included in Neger-Caleb, may rather, in <span class="accented">distinction</span> from it, designate the northern portion of the territory of Caleb. The solution of the problem will probably not yield to anything but a justly restored text.

This statement would lead us to suppose that we were assuredly reading of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; but it cannot be so. The name of Caleb, with the questions gathering round it, will be best considered here. Of the nine times in which it occurs in this chapter, the mere duplicates (of vers. 20, 46, 48) may be at once counted off. The compound "Caleb-ephratah" of ver. 24 has been already dealt with. Nor need we for the present suppose ver. 50 to have any real meaning inconsistent with its apparent meaning, viz. that Caleb is the name of a grandson (son of Hut) as well as of the grandfather. There remain the occasions of the occurring of the word in vers. 9, 18, 42, 49. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The first appearance, then, of the name in this chapter (ver. 9) exhibits it in a form different from that in which it appears the other times in this chapter or elsewhere, viz. as <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> (or once as a patronymic, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). The Vulgate follows the Hebrew, but the Septuagint has at once substituted Caleb. The Syriac Version has Salchi, and the Arabic Sachli, both of them, no doubt, mere transcribers' errors through the mistake of a letter. This form "Chelubai" is, then, an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and no different account has yet been given of the name appearing thus on this one occasion. It may be described, with Lange ('Comm. Old Testament,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>), as "adjectivus gentilis" to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, which word, however, occur where it will, is never treated as a synonym with Caleb except by the Septuagint, and then but once (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-11.htm">1 Chronicles 4:11</a>), making Lange's further claim of <span class="accented">three</span> forms for the name of Caleb wrong. The name might be translated the "Cheluban" or "Chelubite." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The Caleb called here first "Chelubai," again" Caleb the son of Hezron," and now "Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel," some, and Keil among them, have endeavoured to identify with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. This latter is a well-known figure in history. He, together with Joshua, was among those who, departing from Egypt, were pursued of Pharaoh, and of all the host these two alone lived to enter into the promised land. This is enough to give him distinction and a prominent place before the eye. To this Caleb unmistakable reference is made in twenty-eight passages, in sixteen of which he is called "son of Jephunneh," and in three of those sixteen "son of Jephunneh the Kenazite." Now, he tells us himself (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7</a>) that he was forty years old in the seceded year after the Exodus. But it seems (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12, 26</a>) that Hezron, grandson of Judah, and the father of the Caleb of this chapter, was, however young, one of those who went down into Egypt with Jacob, at a date, according to any chronology, which must render it impossible for any son of his to have been alive and only forty years of age at the time of the Exodus. This being so, either the statement already referred to, found at the close of ver. 49, that "the daughter of Caleb was Achsa," must be an interpolation from some ignorant transcriber's marginal annotation, or, unlikely as it is, Caleb the son of Hezron and Caleb the son of Jephunneh both named a daughter Achsa. It is, moreover, likely enough that the frequent describing of Caleb the son of Jephuuneli in this style was occasioned by the desire to distinguish him from some other Caleb, <span class="accented">not</span> a contemporary, indeed, but already well known m a generation preceding but not too remote. Other considerations decidedly concur with this view: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ram is <span class="accented">brother</span> of Caleb the son of Hezron; he has a grandson, Nahshon, of great distinction," a prince of the children of Judah," whose sister Aaron married; he was the elect of the Judah tribe to assist Moses and Aaron in the first numbering of the people (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>). Great prominence is given to him (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>). He was clearly (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-32.htm">Luke 3:32</a>) fifth in descent from Judah, in perfect agreement with the table of this chapter. Now, it was this <span class="accented">grandson</span> of the <span class="accented">elder</span> brother of Caleb who was contemporary with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. Similarly, the Bezaleel of this chapter (ver. 20), a great-grandson of Caleb the Hezronite, is spoken of (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30</a>) at the same date exactly at which Caleb the son of Jephunneh says he was still but forty years of age l <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The identity of the Caleb of ver. 50, son of Hut, with Caleb the son of Jephuuneh is supposed by some, but is not clear. It appears to be asserted, without explanation, in the arts. "Caleb" and "Ephrath," signed A. C. H., Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' though in the second part of the latter article it is alluded to as only possible. On the other hand, it may rather be that Caleb the son of Jephunneh, instead of being identical with this Caleb the son of Hur, is so called in order to distinguish him from this latter as a contemporary. Again, it has been happily conjectured ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that just as ver. 33 closes the table of Jerahmeel with "<span class="cmt_word">These were the sons of Jerahmeel</span>," so ver. 49 should close the table of Caleb (ver. 42) with the words, These were the Boris of Caleb. With a slight alteration, ver. 50 would then begin <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Hur</span>, etc. This is, however, only conjecture. Ver. 42, then, must be considered to give us another family of Caleb, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a family by another wife, of name not given, just possibly the Jerioth unaccounted for in ver. 18. The first statement lauds us in perplexity. <span class="cmt_word">Mesha</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) is the <span class="cmt_word">firstborn</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the wife or woman in question), and the <span class="cmt_word">founder of Ziph</span>. And amid some omission or corruption of text, we are then confronted with the words, <span class="cmt_word">and the sons of Marsehah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the father</span> (or again, perhaps <span class="accented">founder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of Hebron</span>. The reading of the Septuagint gives Mareshah in <span class="accented">both</span> of these passages, and may come from a Hebrew text that we have not. The substitution could, however, scarcely be accounted for as a <span class="accented">mere</span> clerical error, considering both the omission of a <span class="accented">resh</span> and the replacing of an <span class="accented">he</span> with an <span class="accented">ayin.</span> The sentence refuses at present any treatment except the unsatisfactory one of pure conjecture. But employing this, it may be noted that the omitting of the words, "the sons of," before Mareshah would most help to clear the verse of confusion. In this and following verses, <span class="cmt_word">Ziph, Hebron, Tappuah, Jorkoam,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Beth-zur,</span> are all names of places certainly, whether or not they are all of persons.

Houbigant translates, "Porro Haran genuit Jahdai," and so summarily removes the difficulty from his way (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). Hiller ('Onomasticon,' S.) would make it the same name as Moza, but without any pretence of argument.

The town Netophah (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-21.htm">Ezra 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-26.htm">Nehemiah 7:26</a>) gave the gentile noun <span class="cmt_word">Netophathites</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-28.htm">2 Samuel 23:28</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ataroth, the house of Joab</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "crowns" of the house of Joab), is not mentioned elsewhere; but the reason of its being distinguished thus may be due to the fact that there was another Ataroth <span class="accented">of Gad</span> (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 34</a>), and yet another <span class="accented">of Ephraim</span> (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-5.htm">Joshua 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Zorites</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) Gesenius thinks to be another gentile form from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d4;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, but of them we do not read elsewhere.

This sixth set of descendants from Salma is exhibited to us in the shape of a trio of scribe families, the heads of which will have been, presumably, <span class="cmt_word">Tira,</span> Shimea, and <span class="cmt_word">Suchah</span>. They are said to have <span class="cmt_word">dwelt at Jabez</span>, a place not ascertained; and scarcely to be put into connection with the Jabez of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-9.htm">1 Chronicles 4:9</a>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">translated</span> the names of these three families: <span class="accented">Canentes et resonantes et in tabernaculis commorantes</span>;" and Bertheau advocates the interpretation. These families, it appears, were not purely of Judah; but very interesting it is that, though of the people whose land and possessions were to yield to the descendants of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>), yet friendship and intermarriage had found them apparently a lasting place in Judah (<a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), while Saul was careful to urge them to save themselves when he was about to smite the Amalekites (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>). Though nothing is known of the link of connection given here in the name Hemath (of which the Vulgate gives the rendering, <span class="accented">Qui venerunt de celose patris</span>), yet the house of the <span class="cmt_word">Rechabites</span> is well known (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2, 5, 18</a>; and cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2</a>, particularly 3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> In ver. 51 <span class="cmt_word">Hareph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>) only here; though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;</span>, found <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-24.htm">Nehemiah 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-20.htm">Nehemiah 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-18.htm">Ezra 2:18</a>, may possibly he connected with it. There is nothing further said of any people derived from him except that he was <span class="cmt_word">father of Beth-gader</span>. The identification of this place is not certain. Gesenius thinks it perhaps the same with Gederah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>), but it is more probably the Gedor of same chapter (fifty-eighth verse), on the road between Hebron and Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_chronicles/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
