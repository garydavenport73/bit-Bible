Yet there can scarcely he any doubt of the meaning of the verse, viz. that the writer would speak of <span class="cmt_word">the children of Israel, including the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, as regards their courses and their number in their courses, as they succeeded one another, month by month, including also all those officers who served the king in any relation to these courses - the courses were twelve, and each course was numbered twenty-four thousand.</span> Meantime, when we turn to the list, we do not find any full complement of <span class="accented">chiefs</span>, <span class="accented">captains</span>, and <span class="accented">officers</span> specified, but apparently only the <span class="accented">chief</span> of each course, with somewhat ambiguous additions in vers. 4 (Mikloth), 6 (Ammizabad), 7 (Zebadiah); while what seems an unnecessary stress repeats the <span class="accented">number</span> each time. This, however, in fact, tallies with the clause "respecting their number" in the first verse, and may constitute the explanation of the apparent inconsistency in question. Milman ('Hist. of the Jews,' 1:251, edit. 1830) says on this military portion of David's preparations, that he "organized an immense disposable force; every month twenty-four thousand men, furnished in rotation by the tribes, appeared in arms, and were trained as the standing militia of the country. At the head of his army were officers of consummate experience and, what was more highly esteemed in the warfare of the time, extraordinary personal activity, strength, and valour. His heroes remind us of those of Arthuror Charlemagne, excepting that the <span class="accented">armour</span> of the feudal chieftains constituted their superiority; here, main strength of body and dauntless fortitude of mind." <span class="cmt_word">Which came in and went out month by month</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> exchanged places in rotation (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5-7, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>).

The <span class="accented">tau</span> in this word is probably an error for the article. Kennicott ('Dies.,' 72, 82) confirms this supposition by noting that the Book of Samuel constantly replaces by the definite article what appears in Chronicles as "son of." He has also shown reason for believing that the words in this passage, "that sat in the seat, are a corruption of the Hebrew text for characters that would spell our name "Jashobeam." We know nothing of this name "Hachmon," which may be the name of an earlier forefather, while <span class="cmt_word">Zabdiel</span>, thence named "the Hach-monite," appears to Be the name of the actual father of Jashobeam. Jashobeam was of Judah.

The appearances of the Hebrew text, however, favour the supposition of an inaccurate text.

However differently enough from the method of either nature or mankind, the antidote has here preceded the evil. For <span class="cmt_word">because there fell wrath for it</span>, read the Hebrew, <span class="accented">and there was for this wrath upon Israel.</span> The last sentence of the verse purports to say that such numbering as had been done before the point at which Joab stopped was not honoured by a place, where other numbers were found, in the register of the chronicles of King David. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-25.htm">1 Chronicles 27:25</a></div><div class="verse">And over the king's treasures <i>was</i> Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, <i>was</i> Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-31.</span> - These verses have for their primary object, not to give an exhaustive summary of the wealth of David and the sources thereof, but to give the names of those persons who were charged with the care, or the management and care, of' it. The classification, however, is interesting, and may be naturally expected to be tolerably complete. We do not find any distinction made between such property as might have belonged to David as private property, and such as belonged to him as king - probably because there was none worth making. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">storehouses</span>, read, as in former clause, <span class="accented">treasures.</span> The suggestion of the second half of this verse in comparison with the first is that <span class="cmt_word">Azmaveth's</span> charge was over treasures in Jerusalem. For the castles, see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, though the same in both clauses, may probably enough cover precious treasure, as of gold, silver, costly raiment, etc. (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), more particularly in the first clause, and grain, fruit, etc. (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-11.htm">2 Chronicles 11:11</a>), in the latter, for the word has distinctly this double application.

It was a common tree, and useful to the poor. It is the same with the <span class="accented">black</span> mulberry of Egypt, and abounded in Palestine (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>). Its fruit was eatable, and its wood, though soft, yet valuable for enduringness (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3. p. 1394; Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., pp. 223, 399; Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 146, 393).

It is possible that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> may mean "nephew," as simply meaning "relative." It must be admitted, however, as very remarkable, that in Leviticus, Numbers, the historical books, Jeremiah, and Amos, to the number of sixteen times in all, the word confessedly means "uncle;" while this seventeenth time, it would appear to mean "nephew." On the other hand, in Proverbs, Canticles, Isaiah, Ezekiel, to the number of thirty-six times in all, the word follows its other branch of signification of "love," and in particular "one beloved."
