Its literal signification is "the bridle or curb of the mother city," and may mark a special strong position which commanded Gath, or it may describe Gath as owning itself to such a position. Gesenius understands it to mean that David "subjected the metropolis of the Philistines to himself," quoting the Arabian proverb, To <span class="accented">give</span> one s bridle to any one, as equivalent to submitting to him. He quotes also <a href="../../par/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>. It may be noted that Ammah is spoken of (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-24.htm">2 Samuel 2:24</a>) as the name of a hill, otherwise unknown, however. Although David subdued so many places, he reigned over them, <span class="accented">i.e</span>, over many of them, still by "their own kings" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>).

As the form of expression in the last two clauses of our present verse is the same in both cases, it is more natural to render<span class="cmt_word">, David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved a hundred</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hundred horses unhoughed; he houghed all but a hundred. Our Authorized Version, in the parallel, gets over the difficulty by inserting "for," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enough for, "a hundred chariots."

Much doubt has been entertained as to the meaning of this word. Its etymology is uncertain. Gesenius derives it from a root signifying "hardness." For the most part, however, the context of the seven places of its occurrence which he instances (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>) favour the rendering "shields," though the quotation from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a> (literally, "fill ye the shields") is not so satisfactory. The wealth of Zobah is, of course, illustrated by these shields of gold.

These names replace <span class="accented">Betah</span> and <span class="accented">Berothai</span> in the parallel place, in the former case with possibility of orthographic explanation, but not in the latter.

It is now called a sea, because of its large size. The use of the original laver is plainly told, for the priests to wash at it their hands and feet before offering sacrifices. It stood in the court of the tabernacle, between the altar and the door. The ten lavers of Solomon's temple were used for washing the sacrificial victims themselves (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>). The brazen sea (which was rather of <span class="accented">copper</span> than brass, however) rested upon twelve standing oxen, three turning their faces to each quarter of the heavens. Its height was five cubits, its diameter ten cubits, the thickness of its metal a handbreadth, and its capacity variously given at two thousand baths (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-26.htm">1 Kings 7:26</a>) or three thousand (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>). It was removed from its supports of oxen by Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>), and placed on a pedestal of stone. And it was eventually destroyed by the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13</a>). <span class="accented">And the pillars.</span> (For these pillars of the porch, named <span class="accented">Jachin</span> and <span class="accented">Boaz</span>, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15-17</a>.) <span class="accented">And the vessels of brass.</span> (For these, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40-51</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16-18</a>.)

The parallel place omits to say that it was by aid of Abishai that David slew these eighteen thousand Edomites. They are there called Syrians, which reading is at all events in keeping with the Aram of the previous verse. Abishai, here named son of Zeruiah, possibly served under "Joab son of Zeruiah" (ver. 15), who is spoken of (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>) as very trenchant in this Edomite war, without any mention being made of Abishai. <a href="../../par/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>.

The phrase occurs twice with the article expressed, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>.

The real situation of this place is still doubtful. Since the time of the German traveller Geethen ('Reisen,' 2:356), and of Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:109), it has been generally assumed to be a tract of land extending some six miles south of the Dead Sea, and bounded at that distance by the range of hills which there runs across the country; but beside the consideration that the word "ravine" could not describe that tract of country, there are others very unfavourable to the supposition (see these carefully stated by Grove, in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1097).

The historical development of this title is obscure, and not easy to trace. The use of some form or other of the root is abundantly frequent from the times of the earliest parts of Scripture, in the sense of "numbering," or "declaring," or "recording." Perhaps our title of "secretary" would answer sufficiently to it, and all the better, because the Old Testament scribes were also of different leading kinds, like in some degree to our various secretaries of state. There was the kind of scribe of <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a> - where our Authorized Version is far from the mark, and should rather read "the staff of the scribe," in place of "the pen of the writer" - a military officer, whose duty it was to keep the muster-roll. There was the scribe of <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>  - a passage which throws light on the former (see also <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>). There were the scribes of a more literary, lawyer-like, or clerk-like kind, as here, and in the parallel place, and in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>. In the time of Hezekiah, if not before, the scribes became distinctly a class of men (<a href="../../par/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>); and the times of the Captivity greatly enlarged their importance. Their exact duties in the best times of the monarchy are not laid down, but the dignified place the king's scribe held is evident from the company in which he is placed here and in the parallel passage.

On the other hand, a comparison of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a> would lead us to treat them as the names of people, although the Pelethites are net as identifiable in this sense as the Cherethites and Gittites. Anyway, it is evident they were the special guard of the king, and were faithful to David and to Solomon after him. Their duties included those of the executioner or <span class="accented">lictor</span>, and the courier. They are frequently mentioned on special occasions of the king's moving, and of danger (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-7.htm">2 Samuel 20:7, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38, 44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Chief about the king</span>. The Hebrew text here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The word used in the parallel place is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, which signifies strictly "priests," but sometimes more generally" princes." This is, without doubt, the meaning of our text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_chronicles/17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 17"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 19"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
