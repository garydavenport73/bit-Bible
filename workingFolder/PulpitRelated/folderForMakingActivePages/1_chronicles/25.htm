This is clear from the list of vers. 9-31, which contains all the same names as are found in the present vers. 2-4, and one more, Shimei, which therefore offers to supply the place vacant here.

Ewald suggests that these may be the commencing lines of some ancient prophet's oracles (Ewald, 'Lehrbueh der H. Spr.,' &sect; 274, S. 672, 7th edit., cited by Keil).

There is difficulty in assigning the right place of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">to lift up the horn</span>. There can be no doubt at all that it contains no allusion whatever to the horn as an instrument of sound (the almost solitary approach to which use of the word is found in <a href="../../par/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>), but that it falls in with the very frequent <span class="accented">figurative</span> use of the phrase as it occurs in the very same words (<a href="../../par/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1, 10</a>, etc.), and which means "to add to the strength" or "honour" of any one. The allusion is to the number of Heman's children being a mark of the honour God set on him. The words cannot go with the latter part of the verse, while the conjunction (<span class="accented">vav</span>) in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> opens it.

These brethren (partly composed of their <span class="accented">sons</span>, as appears from vers. 9-31) were to aid in the songs of the Lord, and were apparently under instruction for that purpose. Each one of the twenty-four had eleven associated subordinates with him, and for whose instruction and service he was probably answerable. These would, of course, multiply up to the <span class="cmt_word">two hundred four score and eight</span> mentioned in the verse. This verse appears (contrary to the interpretation of Keil, Bertheau, and others) with sufficient precision to mark <span class="accented">two</span> classes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, the latter <span class="accented">not</span> embracing the former, but the two together making up the two hundred and eighty-eight spoken cf. These two classes will surely satisfy the "teacher and the scholar" classification of the following verse; the classes are denoted by the same Hebrew roots. In ver. 7 the passive Pual participle of the instructed and the Hiphil participle of the cunning, or skilled, correspond exactly with the "scholar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) and the "teacher" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) of ver. 8. The contents of vers. 9-31 point to the same, being as they are without an allusion to any other outsiders - to any but the already introduced names of "sons" and "brethren." The supposing, therefore, of any allusion here to the "four thousand" of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a> seems unnecessary and unnatural in whatever way they were distributed - and probably enough it was in an analogous manner - no distinct reference is made to them here.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-9.htm">1 Chronicles 25:9</a></div><div class="verse">Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons <i>were</i> twelve:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-31.</span> <span class="accented">- List of the choirs in the order in which their lots came.</span> The formula, <span class="cmt_word">his sons, and his brethren</span>, which follows twenty-two out of the twenty-four leaders' names which now come before us, is absent from ver. 9, where we should have looked for it, viz. after the name <span class="cmt_word">Joseph</span>. It has been supposed that this is a mere omission of carelessness. But this can scarcely be asserted conclusively. It is observable, for instance, that the order of the formula in the same verse, on occasion of its very first occurrence, is not identical with the other twenty-two instances of it, the word "brethren" preceding "sons," and the pronoun "he" being expressed. The preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>) is sometimes expressed and sometimes not expressed before both the proper names and the ordinal numerals of the list. Examination of the contents of these verses shows, either that it was due to the Divine direction of the lot (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>) that an issue resulted which looks so unlike mere chance, and the system of which is so methodical and traceable; or that the lot-taking was not one of families and sons, all thrown together from the first. This supposition would, of course, leave room for some such ingenious hypothesis as that of Berthean, too artificial by far to be defensible except as a theory that would indeed work out the result. He suggests that the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> was by two urns, one for the first seven odd numbers, into which were put the names of Asaph's four sons and of the second, third, and fourth of Heman; the other for the first seven even numbers, into which were put the six sons of Jeduthun and the first of Heman. Turning from such a concocted theory to these verses, we find that the first cast brings to the surface the <span class="accented">second</span> son of Asaph, and the second cast brings up the eldest son of Jeduthun. At the end of the seventh all of Asaph's sons are exhausted, and what would have been his next place (the ninth) is occupied by the second son of Heman, whose eldest had just taken the sixth place so thrown out by the lot. At the end of the fourteenth throw Jeduthun's six sons are all used up, and all the remaining places belong to Heman's sons, but still in the order in which they are thrown out by the lot.
