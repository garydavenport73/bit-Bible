LIST OF GENERATIONS FROM ADAM TO NOAH. These verses contain a line of genealogical descents, ten in number, from <span class="cmt_word">Adam</span> to <span class="cmt_word">Noah</span>, adding mention of the three sons of the latter. The stride from Adam to Seth, and the genealogy's entire obliviousness of Cain and Abel, are full of suggestion. All of these thirteen names in the Hebrew and in the Septuagint Version, though not those in the Authorized Version, are facsimiles of those which occur in <a href="../../par/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>. They are not accompanied, however, here, as they are there, by any chronological attempt. Probably the main reason of this is that any references of the kind were quite beside the objects which the compiler of this work had in view. It is, however, possible that other reasons for this chronological silence may have existed. The uncertainities attaching to the chronology found in Genesis, as regards this table, may have been suspected or evident - uncertainties which afterwards proclaim themselves so loudly in the differences observable between the Hebrew, Samaritan, and Septuagint versions. Thus the Hebrew text exhibits the total aggregate of years from Adam to the birth of Noah, as amounting to one thousand and fifty-six; the Samaritan version to seven hundred and seven only; and the Septuagint to as many as sixteen hundred and sixty-two; nevertheless, all three agree in adding five hundred years onward to the birth of Shem, and another hundred years to the coming of the Flood. It must be remarked of this first genealogical table, whether occurring here or in Genesis, that, notwithstanding its finished appearance, notwithstanding the impression it undoubtedly first makes on the reader, that it purports to give all the intervening generations from the first to Shem, it may not be so; nor be intended to convey that impression. It is held by some that names are omitted, and with them of course the years which belonged to them. There can be no doubt that this theory would go far to remove several great difficulties, and that some analogies might be invoked in support of it, from the important genealogies of the New Testament. The altogether abrupt opening of this book - a succession of proper names without any verb or predication - cannot be considered as even partially compensated by the first sentence of ch. 9, "So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah." This verse applies directly to the genealogies of Israel and the tribes, beginning ch. 2:1, while under any circumstances, we must look on the first portion of this book as a series of tables, here and there slightly annotated, and suddenly suspended before the eyes.

LIST OF SONS AND GRANDSONS OF JAPHETH. After the mention of Noah's three sons, in the order of their age (though some on slender ground think Ham the youngest), this order, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, is reversed; and the compiler, beginning with <span class="cmt_word">Japheth</span>, the youngest, apparently with the view of disposing of what his purpose may not so particularly require, gives the names of seven sons and seven grandsons, viz. three through <span class="cmt_word">Gomar</span>, the eldest son, and four through <span class="cmt_word">Javan</span>, the fourth son. These fourteen names are identical in the Authorized Version with the list of <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-4</a>. The Septuagint, though not identical in the spelling of the four names <span class="cmt_word">Madai</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Tiras</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Kittim</span>, shows no material differences in the two places. In the Hebrew, according to the text and edition consulted, very slight variations are found in the orthography of Tubal (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> here for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) and Tarshish (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> here for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>)and in the adoption of <span class="cmt_word">Riphath</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Dodanim</span> in this book for <span class="accented">Diphath</span> and <span class="accented">Rodanim.</span> The names <span class="accented">Kittim</span> and <span class="accented">Dodanim</span> look less like names of individuals than of such family, tribe, or nation as descended from the individual. At the close of this short enumeration, we have in Genesis the statement, "By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations." It is evident here also that, whether the compiler borrowed from the Book of Genesis itself, or from some common source open to both, his objects are not exactly the same. Time and the present position and condition of that part of his people for which he was writing governed him, and dictated the difference. Accordingly we do not pause here on the colonizings and the fresh seats and habitations of the sons and grandsons of <span class="accented">Japheth.</span> The subject, one of extreme interest, and the threads of it perhaps not so hopelessly lost as is sometimes thought, belongs to the place in Genesis from which the above verse is cited. It may, however, be written here that the rather verbose disquisitions of Joseph Mede are neither altogether unin-retorting nor in some parts of them unlikely. They form Discourses 47, 48, bk. 1. (edit. 'The Works of Joseph Mode.' London, 1664).

However, in Genesis the following statements are added to Nimrod's name: - "He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty. hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city." And again, at the close of the enumeration of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons, follow the statements, "And afterwards were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comsat to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations."

Also after this description of Nimrod, it proceeds to the enumeration of the posterity of Shem, omitting all mention of Ham's grandsons through Mizraim and Cainan. Up to that point the names in this book and Genesis are in agreement in the Septuagint Version.

In the name <span class="cmt_word">Zemarite</span>, it is suggested by Michaelis, that we have allusion to the place Sumra, on the west coast of Syria, this Sumra being the Siniyra of Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 5:20), and of the Spanish geographer of the first century, Pomponius Mela (1. 12). But the place Zimira, in company with Arpad, is found in the Assyrian inscriptions of Sargon, n.o. 720, leaving little cause to hesitate in accepting the identification of Michaelis (Courier's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 233). Certainty, however, cannot be felt on the subject. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Meshech.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-27.</span> - D. THE LIST OF SHEM'S DESCENDANTS TO ABRAM. This list is broken in two; it pauses a moment exactly halfway to Abram, at the name <span class="cmt_word">Peleg</span>, to mention Peleg's brother <span class="cmt_word">Joktan</span> and Joktan's thirteen sons. Then, repeating the first five names of lineal descent, and picking up the thread at Peleg, the list gives the remaining five to Abram. In the first half of this list, we have apparently the names of nine sons of Shem, but, as Genesis explains, really the names of five sons, and through Aram, the last of them, the names of four grandsons. Another grandson, through Arphaxad the third son, follows, and through this grandson two consecutive lineal descents bring us, in the name Peleg, half-way to Abram. It is here the lineal table pauses to give Joktan and his thirteen sons. The names then in this portion of the list are twenty-six in number. In the Authorized Version they correspond with those in Genesis, except that <span class="cmt_word">Meschech</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>) here is called Mash (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) there; <span class="cmt_word">Shelah</span> here is spelled Salah there; and <span class="cmt_word">Ebal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) here is written Obal (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) there. The difference between the Hebrew texts justifies the first and last of these variations in the Authorized Version, but in all other respects those texts are in entire accord with one another, for this paragraph. The Septuagint gives very little of this portion of the list. It corresponds, whether with the Hebrew or the Authorized Version, only as far as to the name Arphaxad, after which it carries down the line at once to Abram by the remaining eight names as given in our twenty-fourth to twenty-seventh verses. Nor is it in agreement with its own version in Genesis, which has points of important variation with the Hebrew text also. It is then at this break of the list that, after the names of Joktan's sons, we have in Genesis these words, "And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lauds, after their nations. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the Flood." Upon this follows the account of Babel, in nine long verses, and then a chronological summary is furnished in lineal descent <span class="accented">only</span> from Shem to Abram. It is with the names in this chronological summary that those in this second part of our list (vers. 24-27) are found to agree. But any attempt at reproduction of the chronology found in Genesis is again absent here. At this point a significant stage of these genealogies is reached. The ever-broadening stream of population now narrows again. Two thousand years have flown by, then Abraham appears on the stream and tide of human life. Of that long period the life of Adam himself spanned nearly the half. So far we learn without partiality of all his descendants in common. But henceforth, the real, the distinct purpose of the genealogy becomes apparent, in that the line of the descendants of Abraham, and that by one family, alone is maintained, and proves to be a purpose leading by one long straight line to Christ himself. With Abraham "the covenant of innoceney," long forfeited in Adam, is superseded by the everlasting "covenant of grace," and we lose sight in some measure of Adam, the "common father of our flesh," to think of a happier parentage found in Abraham, the "common father of the faithful."

That these stand in the inverse order of their birth and age requires no explanation.

And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed." Although stated in the first place in the order of importance, and Isaac takes precedence of Ishmael, the name of this latter and of his posterity are treated of first.

But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his sou, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."

Of <span class="accented">Esau</span>, the names of five sons are given; and of seven grandsons by the first in order, and four grandsons by the second in order of these sons. In <a href="../../par/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1-5</a> we have the names of the five sons of Esau, which correspond in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text exactly with those of this list. We have there in addition the names of their mothers respectively, who were "daughters of Canaan," Adah of the Hittites, mother of the first; Bashamath of the Ishmaelites, mother of the second (and by these two lines came the seven and four grandsons); and Aholibamah of the Hivites, mother of the remaining three sons. The names correspond also in the Septuagint in the two places, with the minute differences of Eliphaz and Ieoul here, for <span class="accented">Eliphas</span> and <span class="accented">Ieous</span> there. Then follow the names of seven grandsons of Esau though his son <span class="cmt_word">Eliphaz</span>, of whom the first five are found and in agreement (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>), with the exception of <span class="cmt_word">Zephi</span> here for Zepho there, both in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text. But the sixth name here, Timna, is explained in Genesis as the name of a concubine of Eliphaz, by whom he had the son <span class="cmt_word">Amalek</span>, who appears here as the seventh son. There can be no doubt that we come here upon a transcriber's error, and it would be easily amended if we read "and by Timna, Amalek," <span class="accented">vice</span> "and Timna and Amalek." If this be the correct account of the matter, the grandsons of Esau of course count one fewer here. These two names also tally in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text in the two places; while for all seven names the agreement in the Septuagint is exact, except that we read Gootham here for Gothom there. There remain, in ver. 37, four grandsons to Esau, by Reuel. Their names agree with Genesis in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint, except that this last reads <span class="cmt_word">Naches</span> here for Nachoth there.

LIST OF DESCENDANTS OF SEIR. These verses contain the names of seven sons of <span class="cmt_word">Seir</span> and one daughter, and of grandsons through every one of the seven sons, viz. two through <span class="cmt_word">Lotan</span> the first, five through <span class="cmt_word">Shobal</span> the second, two through <span class="cmt_word">Zibeon</span> the third, one through <span class="cmt_word">Anah</span> the fourth, four through <span class="cmt_word">Dishon</span> the fifth, three through <span class="cmt_word">Ezar</span> the sixth, and two through <span class="cmt_word">Dishan</span> the seventh, - twenty-six names in all, or, including the one daughter, who is introduced as <span class="cmt_word">Lotan's</span> <span class="cmt_word">sister</span>, twenty-seven. The first question which arises is, who Seir was, now first mentioned here. He is called in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> "Seir the Horite," and the only previous mention of the name Seir in that chapter is in ver. 8, "Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom;" while we read in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>, "The Horites in mount Self;" in <a href="../../par/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>, "To the land of Seir, the country of Edom." For anything we know of the person Self, then, we are confined to these two notices - that in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> and the one in our text. The name signifies "rough;" and whether Seir. the person, took the name from Seir, the place (a mountain district, reaching from the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf), or <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, it would seem plain that the proper name belonged to the head of the tribe, which had become located there, and was, of course, not in the line of Abraham. This tribe, called Horites - Hori being the name of Seir's eldest grandson - or Troglodytes, acquired their name from hollowing out dwellings in the rocks, as at Petra. They were visited evidently by Esau: he married at least one of his wives from them; and his descendants, the Edomites, in due time dispossessed and superseded them (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>). No doubt some were left behind, and contentedly submitted to the Edomites and became mingled with them. These considerations put together account for the introduction here of the names of Seir and his twenty-seven descendants, while the particulars of their genealogy, so far as here given, would lie easily to hand. The sons of Seir are called in Genesis also "dukes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>), a word answered to by the later "sheikhs;" and they are called "dukes of the Horites," or "the dukes of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Self." The twenty-six or twenty-seven names under notice agree in the Authorized Version entirely with those in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20-27</a>, except that for <span class="cmt_word">Homam, Allan, Shephi, Amram,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Jakan</span> here, we have Hemam, Alvan, Shepho, Hemdan, and Akau there. Also in the Hebrew the texts agree in the two places as regards these names, with the same exceptions. But in the Septuagint the names differ much more in the two places. Thus for <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>),<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> here, we have <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a9;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span> there. When the name of Anah is reached in Genesis, it is added, "This was that Anah that found the mules [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, more probably 'hot springs,' as the finder of which Anah is supposed to have been called <span class="accented">Beeri</span>] in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon, his father." And again, when Dishon is mentioned as the son of Anah, there is added, "And Aholi-bamah the daughter of Anah." Note is made of her name, no doubt, for the same kind of reason as Timna is mentioned above. Aholibamah (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> "Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite," <a href="../../par/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>) enjoys notice inasmuch as she became the wife of Esau; and Timna, as she became the concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz, and thereby the mother of Amalek.

These verses contain a list of kings who reigned in <span class="cmt_word">Edom</span>, during a period expressly notified as anterior to the institution of kings in Israel. Some further point of practical use than has been yet ascertained may lie in the preservation of these snatches of Edom's history. Something surely hangs on the emphatic but otherwise gratuitous statement, that kings were unknown in Israel when this line reigned in Edom. It may turn out to cover the fulfilment of some obscure point of prophecy, or to subserve some important chronological purpose; but wedged in as it is, it cannot be permitted to count for nothing. That it stands in identical words in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a> increases not a little the attention to be paid to it. It has hence been asserted far too dogmatically, as by Spinoza, that the Book of Genesis was no work of Moses; or again, that the passage, in the course of some transcription of manuscripts, had found its way from Chronicles, through a marginal note, at last into the text of Genesis (see Kennicott). But these positions are only forced by the assumption that kings must have reigned in Israel before the sentence could have been written, which is an unnecessary assumption. Kings had been promised to Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>), as among his posterity, and had been prophesied of by Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>). It <span class="accented">may have been</span> that Edom, secure in her kings for generations, had been wont to make her boast of them. in comparison of and in presence of her neighbours, and the remark may have <span class="accented">thence</span> originated. Lastly, it has been correctly pointed out that the structure of the sentence in the original does not at all necessitate the suggestion (of which in the English Version there is confessedly the <span class="accented">appearance</span>), that kings had already been in Israel. At the same time, too great stress must not be laid upon this, for the slight alteration of translation that would suit the time for Genesis, would throw it out again for our text here, and yet the words of the original are identical. These kings are eight in number; the parentage or the land of each is given. It is to be noticed that the line of royalty is not hereditary, and that several dukes, or heads of tribes, or princes of districts, rule under the king. The names, whether of persons or places, agree in the Authorized Version as they occur here and in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31-39</a>, except that Saul is here spelt <span class="cmt_word">Shaul</span>, and that we have here <span class="cmt_word">Hadad</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Pai</span> for Hadar and Pan there. These two differences are occasioned by the Hebrew text, and are the only differences between the two Hebrew texts, except that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> here is given <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> there, and that the incorrect spelling here of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> is found right (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>) in Genesis. The superfluous statement, <span class="cmt_word">Hadad</span> died <span class="cmt_word">also</span>, which begins our fifty-first verse, is not found in Genesis. In the Septuagint the variations between the two places are greater, as well as those from the Hebrew text in either place. Thus we <span class="cmt_word">have Asom, Gethaim, Sebla, Roboth, Balaennor, Achobor, Adad,</span> here, for Asom, Getthaim, Samada, Robboth, Ballenon, Achobor, Arad, there. There is also an entire omission here of the name of the wife of the last king, with those of her mother and grandmother, all of which are given in the passage of Genesis, as found in the Hebrew text.

Thus this first chapter contains those genealogical tables which concern the patriarchs from Adam up to Israel, spanning a stretch of some two thousand three hundred years, and embracing also tables of Edom and certain of the descendants of Edom up to the period of kings. The chapter contains not a single instance of a remark that could be described as of a moral, religious, or didactic kind. Yet not a little is to be learnt sometimes, not a little suggested, from omission and solemn silence as well as from speech; no more notable instance of which could perhaps be given, when we take into account time, place, and circumstances, than that already alluded to in the omissions involved in the following of the name of Seth upon that of Adam. The genealogies of this chapter, with their parallels in Genesis, are notable also for standing unique in all the world's writing, and far over all the world's mythology, for retracing the pedigree of the wide family of men, and especially of the now scattered family of the Jew, to its original. From the time of the close of our Chronicle genealogies, supplemented by the earliest of the New Testament, no similarly comprehensive but useful, ambitious but deliberately designed and successfully executed enterprise has been attempted. And as Matthew Henry has well said, since Christ came, the Jews have lost all their genealogies, even the most sacred of them, "the building is reared, the scaffold is removed; the Seed is come, the line that led to him is broken off." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
