Already David had been anointed at Hebron by "the men of Judah, king over the house of Judah" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). And David continued "king in Hebron over the house of Judah seven years and six months" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-4.htm">1 Chronicles 3:4</a>). Notice the agreement of this date with the account of the six sons born to David in Hebron (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>). The explanation of the chronology for Ishbosheth affecting this period is not easy. It is said that he reigned over Israel "two years" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>). Where was the difference of five and a half years lost? Our first verse here, with its apparently emphatic <span class="cmt_word">then</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>), would seem to make it very unlikely that it was lost between the death of Ishbosheth and the kingship of David over "all the tribes of Israel" together with Judah. On the other hand, the interval in question might find its account in the "<span class="accented">long war</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1, 6, 17-21</a>) between the house of Saul and the house of David." There is, however, still possible the supposition that the historian intends to give the intrinsically correct facts of the case, and means that, what with delay before getting the adhesion of the people to Ishbosheth, and what with the early decay of his sovereign power, he could not be said to have <span class="accented">reigned</span> more than two years. This verse, then, shows that the history proper of Chronicles purports to begin from the time of David's rule over the entire and united people, at the exact date of seven and a half years after Saul's death, while no mention is here made of his intermediate partial rule over Judah, or of Ishbosheth's temporary rule over Benjamin and Israel. <span class="cmt_word">All Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the tribes of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>), by their representatives, "the elders of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>; as well as our ver. 3). The first nine verses of this chapter cover the same ground as the first ten verses of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5</a>. Unto Hebron. We learn how David came to be here from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>. "And it came to pass after this" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after David's "lamentation over Saul and Jonathan") "that David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron." Hebron was the "earliest seat of civilized life, not of Judah only, but of all Palestine." It and Bethlehem are two of the most special memorials of David. An interesting sketch of the topography and natural features of this place, and a succinct Biblical history of it in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 164 (edit. 1866), from which comes the following quotation: - "Hebron, according to the Jewish tradition, was the primeval city of the vine. Its name indicates <span class="accented">community or society.</span> It was the ancient city of Ephron the Hittite, in whose gate he and the elders received the offer of Abraham, when as yet no other fixed habitation of man was known in central Palestine. It was the first home of Abraham and the patriarchs; their own permanent resting-place when they were gradually exchanging the pastoral for the agricultural life. In its neighbourhood can be traced, by a continuous tradition, the site of the venerable tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and of the double cavern in which he and his family were deposited and perhaps still remain. It was the city of Arba, the old Canaanite chief, with his three giant sons, under whose walls the trembling spies stole through the land by the adjacent valley of Eshcoh Here Caleb chose his portion when, at the head of his valiant tribe, he drove out the old inhabitants, and called the whole surrounding territory after his own name; and here the tribe of Judah always rallied, when it asserted its independent existence against the rest of the Israelite nation. It needs but few words to give the secret of this early selection, of this long continuance of the metropolitan city of Judah. Every traveller from the desert must have been struck by the sight of that pleasant vale, with its orchards and vineyards and numberless wells, and we must add, in earlier times, the groves of terebinths and oaks which then attracted from far the eye of the wandering tribes. This fertility was in part owing to its elevation into the cooler and the more watered region above the dry and withered valleys of the rest of Judaea  - and commanding this fertile valley, rose Hebron, on its crested hill." <span class="cmt_word">Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh</span>. This is a figurative expression, the pedigree and lineage of which it is interesting to note (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>). The highest service to which it was promoted may be said to be reached, however, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-30.htm">Ephesians 5:30</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-2.htm">1 Chronicles 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i>wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt feed my people Israel</span> (so <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>). Thus to the servant is condescendingly vouchsafed the same description as the Master takes through the Spirit for himself  - to the under-shepherd the same as the Chief Shepherd acknowledges; note same psalm, ver. 72; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-3.htm">1 Chronicles 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Made a covenant</span>... <span class="cmt_word">before the Lord</span>. A forcible use of this phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>. It implies that the engagement was ratified in the presence of a holy place, a holy vessel of the sanctuary, or a holy person (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>). Whether the tabernacle was now at Hebron is doubtful, but the two priests, Abiathar and Zadok, were. <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David</span>. The first time of David's being anointed (l <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 13</a>) Samuel the prophet officiated. The second time (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>) was when the "men of Judah" anointed him king over "the house of Judah." This third time when David was anointed king over the united people, it was at all events at the special instance of "all the elders of Israel," although who officiated on these two last occasions is not mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord by Samuel</span>. The sentence marks the complete fulfilment of what had been foreshadowed in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12, 13</a>; and it may probably have been the more carefully introduced by the compiler of Chronicles, in consideration of the absence from his own work of previous details and of the previous anointings of David. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i>were</i>, the inhabitants of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem, which is Jebus</span>. This ancient name of Jerusalem, of Canaanitish date, is found only once beside, viz. in <a href="../../par/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10, 11</a>; the Gentile form of the noun, however, Jebusi, is of more frequent occurrence, and sometimes it is found even as the name of the city (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8, 63</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16, 28</a>). The derivation and meaning of the word are unascertained. Gesenius explains it to mean "a place dry or downtrodden like a threshing-floor." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-5.htm">1 Chronicles 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i>is</i> the city of David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not come hither</span>. The <span class="cmt_word">inhabitants of Jebus</span> added something beside (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). They had said, "Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither." <span class="cmt_word">The castle of Zion</span>. This fort became the site of the temple. It is the <span class="accented">Acra</span> of Josephus, and is different from the modern Zion. It was the eastern hill in the city, was the second highest elevation in the city, and up to the time of the destruction of the city of Jerusalem was uniformly named Zion, though from the time of Constantine it has been used for the name of the western hill, the site of <span class="accented">Jerusalem.</span> There is but little doubt of the identity of the hill of Moriah with the hill of Zion, though no individual passage of Scripture asserts it. The passage before us, however, with its parallel, tells us plainly enough that the city of David, and that which became the sacred hill of Zion are one; and many passages in the Psalms and the prophets both confirm this and point out the difference between Zion and Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The name and fresh glory of Joab, as given here, are not given in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3-10</a>; and we could suppose that they were purposely withheld there. It is true that Joab already held high office, probably the first place as captain of David's men, but Bertheau's objection to the statements of this verse on such grounds easily yields to the considerations - first, that there can be no doubt Joab had fallen into disfavour with David <span class="accented">and others</span>, upon his slaying of Abner (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26-29, 36, 37</a>); and further, that this was a great occasion, exceedingly favourable for evoking any very special ability of younger or unknown men, at present lost under the shadow of larger growths. The advantage which Joab gained now was one that confirmed his position and increased largely his influence; and an indication that he was not slow to avail himself of it is probably to be traced in the eighth verse, where it is said while "David built...  even from Millo round about,...  Joab repaired the rest of the city." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-7.htm">1 Chronicles 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</div><div class="comm">

There is great uncertainty as to the derivation and the meaning of this word. It is probably not really of Hebrew extraction, but of the oldest Canaanitish origin. In the Hebrew it is always used with the article, and would presumably come from the Hebrew root "to fill." Josephus seems to use, as synonymous expression for "<span class="accented">David's wall round Millo</span>," this, viz. "buildings round about the lower city" ('Jud. Ant.,' 3:2, compared with 5; 'Wars,' 6:1, where he identifies those "buildings," etc., with <span class="accented">Acra</span>). As the name of a family, it is mentioned in connection with Shechem, known specially as a place of the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>). The Septuagint represents it by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. In the remarkable passage, <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>, the word "Silla" is even a greater enigma, which, however, may designate the "steps from the city of David" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), or "the <span class="accented">causeway of going up"</span> to the west of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-16.htm">1 Chronicles 22:16</a>). The likeliest view of Mille is that it was a very strong point of fortification in the surrounding defences of the hill of Zion (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> the otherwise unvarying translation (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Septuagint is superseded by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, a word itself of doubtful signification. For while some would render it by the word "foundation," Schleusner translates it "height." Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:367) puts it in "the neighbourhood of the Tyropaean valley at the foot of Zion." Some clue may lie in the word "inward," applied to the building by David. Does it imply a covering by edifices of the space, or some portion of it, that lay between Zion and the rest of the city? (See also Keil on Kings, vol. 2:163.)

It plainly belongs to the time of the establishment of David's sway over the whole people. The different position of the list here is itself an indication of some force, that the writers of the work of Samuel and of Chronicles availed them- selves independently of the common source, and that the latter did not take through the former.

The Authorized Version reading in the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>) is "full of lentiles," the Hebrew for "barley" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, for "lentiles" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Possibly the words should be the same, one being here spelt, by accident, wrongly for the other (so Kennicott). The first Bible mention of "barley" occurs in <a href="../../par/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>, from which verses we learn that it, together with "flax," was an earlier crop than "rye" and "wheat." It was not only used for food for man (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>), but also for horses (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>). That it was nevertheless of the less-valued grain, we have significant indications, in its being prescribed for the "jealousy offering" (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>, comp. with <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and in its being part of the purchase price of the adulteress (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>). Its derivation in the Hebrew, from a verbal root signifying "to bristle," is in noticeable analogy with the Latin <span class="accented">hordeum</span>, from <span class="accented">horreo.</span> Gesenius's observation, that the singular of the word given above in the Hebrew marks the "growing crop," and the plural the "grain" itself, seems hardly corroborated by this single passage at all events. The <span class="accented">lentile</span>, on the other hand, was a species of <span class="accented">bean</span>, and used much for soup, of which Egyptian tomb-paintings furnish illustration (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a>). Sonnini, in his 'Travels' (translation of Hunter, 3:288), tells us that still the Egyptian poor eat <span class="accented">lentile-bread</span>, but, what is more <span class="accented">apropos</span> of this passage, that in making it they prefer to mix a little "barley" with it. This apparent discrepancy between the parallel accounts not only counts in itself for very little, but may easily be surmounted by supposing that, though it be written that the "parcel" of ground was "full of lentiles," and again "full of barley," the description may only amount to this, that such parcels were in close juxtaposition. But if not, our allusion above to the possible error in the Hebrew words will sufficiently explain the variation.

In that same place Shammah is called the "son of Agee," which probably answers to the "Shage" of the present chapter (ver. 34), where our reading should rather be, "Jonathan the son of Shammah the son of Shage, the Hararite." The word "Hararite" designates, according to Gesenius, "one from the hill-country," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hill-country of Judah or Ephraim, and would be equivalent with us to such a description as "the mountaineer."

It kept name and fame to the last (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). The "rock" marks the limestone cliffs of the region (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 254-259, edit. 1866). We read of it, as David's refuge (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>). From our present passage, and its parallel we should have concluded that it could not have been far from Bethlehem. In this sense Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607) refers to the tradition that fixes the cave at a spot now called <span class="accented">Khureitun</span>, between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea, and says, "Leaving our horses in charge of wild Arabs, and taking one Arab for a guide, we started for the cave, having a fearful gorge below, gigantic cliffs above, and the path winding along a shelf of the rock, narrow enough to make the nervous among us shudder. At length from a great rock, hanging on the edge of this shelf, we sprang by a long leap into a low window, which opened into the perpendicular face of the cliff. We were then within the hold of David, and creeping half-doubled through a narrow crevice for a few rods, we stood beneath the dark vault of the first grand chamber of this mysterious and oppressive cavern. Our whole collection of lights did little more than make the damp darkness visible. After groping about as long as we had Lime to spare, we returned to the light of day, fully convinced that, with David and his lion-hearted followers inside, all the strength of Israel under Saul could not have forced an entrance, and would not even have attempted it." <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host</span>. For this word "host" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) the parallel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>) has the "life of the Philistines" (but the Authorized Version, the "troop of"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beasts and cattle of the Philistines. So also the Syriac Version translates, The Septuagint shows in this place <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, and in Samuel <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">valley of Rephaim</span>. The situation of this notable valley is not certain. Yet there can be little doubt, in spite of Furst ('Handwortbuch,' 2:383), who supposes a situation north-west of Jerusalem, that it must be near Bethlehem, and therefore south-west of the city. The word employed Here for "valley" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> should mark an <span class="accented">enclosed</span> one. <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> means "giants."

He is right, certainly, if he means that it has received both translations, for see <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-19.htm">1 Kings 4:19</a> for the one, and our present passage supplies the other (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>).

If the reference is not as above (see ver. 22), the margin of the parallel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a>) may be followed, which would translate "guard" as <span class="accented">council.</span> This Gesenius adopts, and translates "privy council." There seems, however, no necessity for this, with the references before us above given (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, etc., to which may be added ch. 27:6, which shows Benaiah to be captain of the third division).

The list announced here as comprising "the valiant men of the armies," is unannounced there, but, beginning with the same name, <span class="cmt_word">Asahel</span>, it calls him "one of the thirty," and suggests the inference that those who follow will make up the rest. The number that follows (coinciding in this respect strictly with our list here) is itself thirty, which, though one too many, may be considered satisfactorily accounted for in the fact of the untimely death of Asahel, already recorded (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>). Considering the exact crisis at which he died, it is very likely that his place should be compensated for, although his name were unremoved from the honourable list. Amid the difficulties that develop themselves in the <span class="accented">contents</span> of these lists, when compared, the comparison of them aids the conviction that, so far as they go together, they do stand for "the thirty" spoken of in both places, and that a sentence or two here and there, now lost or corrupted beyond recognition, would clear up the whole subject. The comparison also seems to make it clear that the compiler of Chronicles, meaning to go beyond an enumeration of the <span class="accented">thirty</span>, nowhere speaks of thirty after ver. 25. On the other hand, the writer of the account in Samuel carefully sums up all (ver. 39) in the words, "<span class="accented">thirty</span> <span class="accented">and seven in all</span> " - an addition which means either the actual thirty-one given and the two sets of three each; or the thirty, with the two sets of three each and Joab ever all. Our present chapter, however, goes on to the number forty-eight in all, vers. 41-47, adding sixteen to the thirty-two which precede. Beside some minor differences, it must be said that at fewest three names, <span class="accented">Hepher</span>, <span class="accented">Ahijah</span>, and <span class="accented">Mibhar</span>, in Chronicles, resist identification with those that should (from position) correspond with them in the list of Samuel and with any others. And the same thing may be said of the same number in the list of Samuel (<span class="accented">Elika</span>, <span class="accented">Eliam</span>, <span class="accented">Bani</span>) when compared with the list now before us. The points of contact and clearest identification are, therefore, in so great a majority and are so uniformly distributed that, although it is left hard to decide the causes of them, these differences cannot throw any discredit upon the list as a whole. Perhaps the most probable suggestion to be offered is that the knowledge of the writer of the Book of Samuel enabled him to supersede the names of such as were soon lost to their brave career by death by other names; or, resting on the same fundamental reason, there may have been two different <span class="accented">editions</span> of the list, to one of which the writer of Samuel was indebted, and to the other the compiler of Chronicles.

This sentence is unmanageable as it stands, and is insufficiently assisted from its parallel But if from this latter we take the suggestion of the preposition "from" (Authorized Version) before "the sons" (which, however, is not in the Hebrew), and from the Alexandrian Septuagint, the suggestion of the name <span class="accented">Gouni</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), <span class="accented">Guni</span>, (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-15.htm">1 Chronicles 5:15</a>) in the place of <span class="accented">Gizonite</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), we should obtain a coherent reading. But this would be mere conjecture suggested by the Septuagint, and "the Gizonite" offers the difficulty of the presence of the article, which would not subsist with the proper name Guni. Were it not that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> is found in both passages all difficulty would disappear with <span class="accented">its</span> disappearance. The remainder of this verse, in relation to vers. 32 and 33 of the parallel, illustrates opportunely the uncertainties of the text. For, as seen <span class="accented">above</span>, Jonathan is the <span class="accented">grandson</span> of Shage (<span class="accented">Agee</span>, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>), and son of Shammah, while (2 Chronicles 23:32, 33) the parallel reads "Jonathan," with no connective word "son" at all, yet supplies the right name, "Shammah the Hararite" for the father, and omits all mention of Shage.

For these three names the parallel shows <span class="accented">Sharar</span>, <span class="accented">Eliphelet</span>, and <span class="accented">Ahasbai</span> respectively.

Although this name is not found in the parallel passage, it is tolerably plain that the niche for it is left before the words (ver. 34), "the son of the Maachathite," which last word answers to our Mecherathite. <span class="cmt_word">Ahijah the Pelonite</span>. This name cannot be identified with the "Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite," which answers to it in the parallel.

For this we have in the parallel place (ver. 36) the names "<span class="accented">Bani</span> the <span class="accented">Gadite</span>;" but before these comes the last word of the previous clause, "of Zobab." When these three words are compared with the three of our present passage, it is very possible to bring them into harmony ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="accented">Zobah</span> was a district of Syria in the time of Israel's first three kings, stretching north-east and east towards the Euphrates (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>).

Among David's great men were evidently numbered some foreigners, whose admiration and fidelity he must have won.

The Hebrew preposition here translated "with" appears thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, and will naturally translate "and in addition to him." As he was a captain, this addendum may probably refer to those over whom he was captain, and whom he brought in his train, and who were possibly themselves officers. As the writer of Chronicles indicates no difference, nor any sense of a change of persons enumerated, when he has reached (ver. 41) Uriah the Hittite, it would all the rather be consistent with his own superscription when (ver. 26) he proposes to set forth simply "the valiant men of the armies" without confining their number to the "thirty."
