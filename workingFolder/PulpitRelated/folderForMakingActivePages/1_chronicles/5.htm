The tribe of Reuben is now taken third in order by the compiler, though Reuben was the first of all the sons of Israel. The distinct statements of vers. 1 and 2, respecting the degradation of Reuben and his loss of the rights of primogeniture, are not to be understood, however, as mentioned in any way to account for his standing third here. That Judah takes in any genealogy the first place needs no other apology than that contained in this passage, "Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> David, and in him "David's greater Son and Lord"). And that Simeon is taken immediately after Judah was natural enough, both because the second place belonged to him, and because his tribe, in journeying, in settlement, and in acknowledged friendship, was so nearly related to that of Judah. It is as an important historical fact, a lesson and stern memento of crime, that the tale of Reuben is here as elsewhere told. Indeed, in the remarkably exalting language applied to Reuben (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>) by the dying father in those "blessings" of his sons which were so marvellously living with prophecy, that "blessing" seemed weighted with hard reality, and may really carry this meaning: "O Reuben I <span class="accented">though</span> thou <span class="accented">art</span> my firstborn, <span class="accented">though</span> my might and the beginning of my strength, <span class="accented">though</span> the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power," <span class="accented">yet</span>, because of thy boiling lust (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>) "thou shall not excel." In that endowing charter of the patriarch's death-bed, the birthright of Reuben is not in so many words given to Joseph and his sons, but what is given to Joseph is so abundant above the lot of all the others, that we find no difficulty in accepting the formal statement of the fact here first found in this passage. The large measure of promise meted to Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>) rests, no doubt, upon the title already referred to. There would seem to be also a righteous moral reason in Joseph after all becoming heir to the birthright, inasmuch as he was the eldest child of her who was Israel's real love, and who, but for deception and sharp practice, would have been his first wife. How he remembered her, and with what determined practical consequence, the affecting passage, <a href="../../par/genesis/48-1.htm">Genesis 48:1-7, 16, 21, 22</a>, sufficiently reveals; yet comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>. The meaning of the last clause of ver. 1 is evidently that, though thus Reuben was the natural firstborn, and Joseph had really the birthright, the registration did not proceed in this instance (probably partly for the very reason of the ambiguity) by the order of birthright, but everything yielded to the special call for precedence on the part of Judah (ver. 2).

Of none of the eight persons beginning with Joel and ending with Beerah is anything else known, unless either <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> or <span class="cmt_word">Shimei</span> may be identical with the Shema of ver. 8, in which case it might be also that the Joel of ver. 8 is identical with that of ver. 4.

These slight differences in the position of the radicals, with the introduction or omission of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, make as many as four different readings in the Hebrew. Tiglath-pileser, the second Assyrian king who came into conflict with the Israelites, reigned <span class="accented">about</span>  <span class="date">B.C. 747-727</span>.

Tigris; and that the latter, a root occurring also in the name <span class="accented">Nabo-pola-saris</span>, is from an Assyrian verb meaning "to guard." He translates the word as "Lord of the Tigris." The Assyrian reproduction of the name is <span class="accented">Tigulti-pal-tsira</span> (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), or <span class="accented">Tukulti-pal-zara</span> ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The Captivity is spoken of further in the last verse of this chapter and in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-31</a>. The Septuagint reads vers. 4 and 5 differently: "The sons of Joel, Semei and Banaea his son; and the sons of Gog the son of <span class="accented">Semei</span>," etc., and this in all three editions - Vatican, Alexandrine, and Aldine.

Nebo was the name of a heathen deity, known among the Chaldeans (<a href="../../par/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), Babylonians, and Assyrians; and this constituted one reason, if not the reason, for changing its name when it had been affixed to the Moabite city.

It takes us to the time of Saul, and from that time up to the time of "the Captivity" (ver. 22) the victorious Reubenites, Gadites, and people of the half-tribe Manasseh had the benefit of enlarged domain at their expense: "They dwelt in their steads," after seizing great spoil. It is exceedingly likely that we have the perpetuation of the name Hagarenes in the Agraeei (modern Hejer) of Strabo, 16:767; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:32; Dionysius, 'Perieg.,' 956; Pt. 5:2 (see art.

Gad was born seventh in order of all the sons of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-9.htm">Genesis 30:9-12</a>), and first of the children of Leah's maid Zilpah. The compiler seems to pass easily on to Gad, from the mere circumstance of the name of the tribe being so constantly linked with that preceding, in the matter of local settlement on the east of Jordan, after the journeyings of the wilderness (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7, 8</a>). The geography in vers. 11 and 16 offers very little difficulty. Compared with the time of the first settling of the Gadites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10-13</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25, 30</a>), it is evident that they had pushed their borders further to the north, trenching somewhat upon the lot of the half-tribe Manasseh, as <span class="accented">they</span> also in turn extended their limits northward to Hermon (ver. 23). This reconciles <a href="../../par/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a> with the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Salcah</span>, or (Authorized Version) Salchah (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>), is probably to be identified as the modern <span class="accented">Sulkhad</span>, at the extreme eastern point of the plain <span class="accented">Hauran</span>, which is bordered by the desert. "In Gilead in Bashan" may be read, with some, as two coordinate places, separating them by a stop; or may point to a time when Bashan included the upper half of Gilead. Sharon, which Keil, quoting Reland, 'Pal. Ill.,' 370, would make the well-known Sharon of Carmel and the Mediterranean, is, though unmentioned elsewhere, probably distinguished sufficiently from it by the absence of the article, which is invariably prefixed to the other. Stanley's suggestion ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 484, 485, 260) would seem exceedingly apt, that it is one in fact, as one in derivation and meaning, with the <span class="accented">Mishor</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "level ]ands," "table-land") of Gilead and Bashan. With this explanation, however, the term "suburbs" does not so well agree. Upon the other side, distant as the well-known Sharon is, a link of connection might be found with it, in that the other Manasseh half-tribe stretched into its plains; and in that case the last word of the verse, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, might mean (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-9.htm">Joshua 17:9</a>) "the outgoings" of the land or regions in question to the "sea"-coast.

The division between these verses has unfortunately cut in half one name, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Buzaki. The translators of the Septuagint saw that the two verses composed one line of ascent, but instead of piecing "Aki" to "Buz," translated it as" brother." Though this line takes us some way back, we find nowhere else any clue or identification of any of these ten persons. Of the twenty-one persons in all, therefore, named as belonging to the tribe of Gad, nothing else is known; and we have nothing to guide us to connect them with any one rather than another of the original" sons of Gad" (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-16.htm">Genesis 46:16</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15-18</a>).

Although presumably it would be an object of closer interest with Israel than with Judah to effect the registration of the Gadite genealogy, yet it was most just that Judah should do so as well. This would both vindicate Judah's own right place and be a happy omen of the continued predominance of her position compared with that of Israel. Independently of the question of <span class="accented">effecting</span> the actual registration, however, it is quite possible that, so long as history ran by the side of history.

Manasseh and his brother Ephraim stand in the place of Joseph, both the children of Joseph's Egyptian wife, Asenath, and born before the famine. Though Manasseh was the elder, Jacob gave the chief blessing (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-10.htm">Genesis 48:10-22</a>) to Ephraim. The Manassites were descended from Manasseh through his son Machir, born of a Syrian concubine (Septuagint, <a href="../../par/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-28.htm">Numbers 26:28-34</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14, 15</a>). Machir evidently was <span class="accented">spes gregis</span> (though apparently not the only son, for see <span class="accented">Asriel</span>, or <span class="accented">Ashriel</span>, in above references), and is repeatedly mentioned with his sou Gilead. It is probable that the division of the tribe was determined partly according to the energy of those who composed it at the time of division - the more warlike being more adapted to the east of Jordan. Nevertheless Machir is distinctly mentioned westward, as well as with Gilead eastward (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14-17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). (For the further prosecution of this part of the subject, see Exposition, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baal-hermon</span>, etc. These three names need scarcely be read as different names for exactly the same region, but as designating different sides or heights of what was essentially one and the same well-known mountain district, with which would agree Psalm 43:6, "Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and <span class="accented">of the Hermonites</span>, from the hill Mizar.' So <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8-10</a> tells us that Hermon was called <span class="accented">Sirion</span> by the Sidonians; Shenir, <span class="accented">i.q. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Senir</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, exactly the same word in the Hebrew text in all the four places of its occurrence - <a href="../../par/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>), by the Amorites. And the suggestion of Grove is likely enough, that <span class="accented">Baal-hermon</span> was the Phoenician cast of the name. If any point were to be gained by reading the names, however, as intended to cover exactly the same tract, it may be noted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Hebrew conjunction will perfectly admit of being translated "even;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the <span class="accented">order</span> of the names, going from the foreign to the native <span class="cmt_word">Hermon</span> itself, would so far favour it.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25</a></div><div class="verse">And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - The "transgressors" here described include manifestly not this half-tribe Manasseh alone, but the other tribes of Israel of whom this chapter has treated. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they went a-whoring</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>); so <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11, 13</a>. This verb, in one form of its root or another, occurs as many as ninety-seven times in the Pentateuch, Judges, Joshua, Psalms, Proverbs; and prophets, for only twice in Kings and four times in Chronicles, in all the rest of the Old Testament writings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a></div><div class="verse">And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pul</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Tilgath-pilneser</span>. These two were chosen ministers of God's will, if not ministers of himself. We can identify the date of this punishment which befell the transgressing Israelites east of the Jordan. The visit of the former, in the reign of Menahem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-15.htm">2 Kings 15:15-20</a>), may be interpreted and might have operated as a lesson and a warning. He was bought off with a thousand talents of silver. It seems to be said with significance," So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land." It was in the reign of Pekah, the usurping successor of Menahem's son Pekahiah, that the completer punishment fell, and Tilgath-pilneser effected the captivity spoken of here and in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-29</a>. The name <span class="accented">Pul</span> cannot, it would appear, be a pure Assyrian name, and there is reason to think it may be identified with <span class="accented">Vul-lush</span> (grandson of the Shalmaneser who warred with Benhadad, etc.), a name found on Assyrian monuments, and belonging to a king who reigned at Calah,  <span class="date">B.C. 8004750</span> (see art. "Pul," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="accented">Tilqath-pilneser</span> (see notes on ver. 6) was probably the founder of the lower dynasty of Assyria, and first king of the new empire. His first invasion was one chiefly of Israel and Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). His second was of a much more significant character. Called in to aid Judah under Ahaz against Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Syria in alliance, he both conquered these latter and brought into vassalage Judah itself (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Halah; Habor Hara; Gozan</span>. This enumeration exceeds that of <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> by the addition of <span class="accented">Hara</span>, important as helping with consistent witness to the antiquity of the region described. <span class="accented">Halah</span> (<span class="accented">not</span> the "Calah" of <a href="../../par/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) is believed to be identifiable with <span class="accented">Chalcitis</span>, its verbal resemblance to which comes out a little more evidently in its Hebrew form (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>). A trace of it possibly remains in the name of a hill, <span class="accented">Gla</span>, on the <span class="accented">Khabour</span>, <span class="accented">i.q. Habor</span> of this passage, an important tributary of the Euphrates, and not the "Chebar" of Ezekiel. This name <span class="accented">Khabour</span> is found in an Assyrian inscription dating upwards of eight centuries before Christ. The mention of Habor in <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> and 2 Kings 18:11 is, in the Authorized Version, made to convey the impression of a place "by" the "river of Gozan," instead of being, what the Hebrew says, "the river of Gozan." Here, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Gozan</span> is, in the Authorized Version, incorrectly translated as a river itself, instead of the region of a river. It is, according to the testimony of Layard ('Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 270-312), a remarkably fertile tract, being the <span class="accented">Gauzanitis</span> of Ptolemy, and substantially the Mygdonia of Polybius and Strabo. <span class="accented">Hara</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, with little doubt, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">Haran</span>, or <span class="accented">Charran</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>), the ancient adopted home of Abraham, in Padan-aram, in Mesopotamia, on the Belik, a small tributary of the Euphrates. It is the Greek <span class="accented">Carrhae</span> of Strabo and Polybius. These four names purport to give us, probably in brief, the information that those of the Captivity here alluded to were divided - some to settle at Halab on one river, some in Hara on another, and the rest in the district called <span class="accented">Gauzanitis.</span> The region called Halah and that called Gau-zanitis, however, were both watered by the Khabour, and therefore the insertion of the name Haran where it is inserted occasions some difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_chronicles/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
