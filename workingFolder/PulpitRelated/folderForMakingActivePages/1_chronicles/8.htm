It has been proposed, in the utter obscurity here, to add this name as a third to Uzza and Ahihud.

And even if it were on other grounds possible to identify the person with the Abiel of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a> and 1 Sam 14:51, it is not possible to identify the names.

Even then, if we accept what the passage allows, it is somewhat remarkable that in the next verse Ner should be signalized as father of Abner rather than of Kish - a difficulty, however, much less considerable if we accept the suggestion (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) to translate ver. 51 thus, by the substitution of the word "sons" for "son:" "And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were <span class="accented">sons</span> of Abiel." It must be remembered at the same time that this is not equivalent to saying that they were necessarily brothers, but only descendants of the <span class="accented">chief</span> of the family, of the Demarch or Phylarch under mention in the genealogy.
