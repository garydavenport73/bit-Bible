This the Masoretic accenting dictates, though the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Luther have our Authorized Version order. The inconvenience to certain of not being able to find their registers is alluded to in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-59.htm">Ezra 2:59</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">Now the first inhabitants that <i>dwelt</i> in their possessions in their cities <i>were</i>, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions, in their cities</span>. Authorities are very divided as to whether this expression describes inhabitants of the land before the Captivity or subsequent to it. Almost all the older authorities, and Keil amongst those of more modern date, take the former position; Movers, Bertheau, and others take the latter, as also Canon Rawlinson ('Speaker's Commentary,' 3:157, 211). It must be admitted that there is some obscurity, and which accounts for the contrariety of opinion. But obscurity and contrariety notwithstanding, a comparison of vers. 2 and 3 with <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a>: produces two impressions almost irresistible, viz. that the difficulty is occasioned by some comparatively slight corruption or mutilation in our ver. 2; and that, whatever the reference is in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a> (and there is no ambiguity there), that it is in the present passage. The fourfold classification intends the <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span> <span class="accented">people</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>), the <span class="cmt_word">priests</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">Levites</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">Nethinims</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those <span class="accented">given</span> as helpers of the priests, bond-men of the temple (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-18.htm">Numbers 8:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/31-47.htm">Numbers 31:47</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40-48</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-17.htm">Ezra 8:17, 20</a>). Not before the time of the return does the name Nethinim seem to have crystallized upon this class of helpers, the explanation of which may possibly be that their numbers and their services then became so much more necessary. To this classification is added in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>, "And the children of Solomon's servants" (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-55.htm">Ezra 2:55</a>).

The name <span class="cmt_word">Azariah</span> (in Nehemiah appearing, probably simply by copyist's error, as <span class="accented">Seraiah</span>), here described as <span class="cmt_word">ruler of the house of God</span>, probably <span class="accented">points</span> to the high priest <span class="accented">Eliashib</span>, who held that office in the time of Nehemiah, and was <span class="accented">descended</span> from Seraiah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-14.htm">1 Chronicles 6:14</a>). The ins and outs of the lists of these verses confirm the supposition that the way in which differences in the other lists occur are easily to be accounted for, in one compiler having selected some of the names of the whole line of genealogy, and another others, though in each several case according to reasons often unknown by us. Thus, between <span class="cmt_word">Jeroham</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Pashur</span> the table of Nehemiah supplies three additional links in the names Pelaliah, Amzi, Zechariah; while in our very next verse, for the three between <span class="cmt_word">Maasiai</span> (Amashai) and <span class="cmt_word">Meshillemith</span>, Nehemiah has only two names, and neither of those two (Azareel, Ahasai) the same as found here.
