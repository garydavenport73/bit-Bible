There can be no doubt that the Hebrew text does say this, and does not merely register the fact of the attendance and presence of the sons of the king, as also it does not specialize the attendance of Solomon himself, though it is certain that he was present.

Eunuchs are never mentioned elsewhere in David's reign. There is no reason to suppose the word means "eunuch," for instance, in <a href="../../par/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-9.htm">1 Kings 22:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a>.

He had not lost the man and the brother in his official and exalted rank, and, following ancient precedents (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-4.htm">Genesis 29:4</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/19-23.htm">Judges 19:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a>), he addresses the congregation as <span class="cmt_word">my brethren, and my people</span>.

God is often spoken of as "dwelling between the cherubim," and sometimes (<a href="../../par/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>) as "<span class="accented">sitting</span> between the cherubim," which were over the <span class="accented">lid</span> of the ark, called the mercy-seat.

This proviso is emphatically presented again to the attention of Solomon, when the time comes for the direct appeal of God to him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-61.htm">1 Kings 8:61</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>).

The. expression, <span class="cmt_word">Know thou the God of thy father</span>, for a practical knowledge and fear of God, is analogous with the expression, "Hear thou," for the matter of practical <span class="accented">obedience</span>; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "If they <span class="accented">hear</span> not Moses and the prophets" (Luke 16:32). Although there are not very many instances of this use of the word "know," its antiquity and classical character may be considered guaranteed by such passages as <a href="../../par/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. The expression, "the God of thy father," evidently intended to be touching, is more fully given in ver. 20, "God, even my God, will be with thee," which in its turn reminds us of Paul's language, "But my God shall supply all your need" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The urgent entreaty on the part of David breathes in every sentence of it, thought, and a mode of presentation of it, feeling, and depth of conviction, with which we are familiar in his psalms. He speaks from his own varied, remarkable, and rich experience of the Divine care and jealous love, and from much personal experience of the deceitfulness of the heart, to Solomon, into whom, were it possible, he would pour the advantage of all he had learned, and from whom he would hide nothing of his intense and anxious solicitude. To the same strain he returns in ver. 20, but there with more exclusive reference to the undertaking of the building of "the house of the Lord," or the <span class="cmt_word">house for the sanctuary</span>. One thing only fails, perhaps, to be made quite apparent from the language of David, viz. why he deemed it necessary to urge so strenuously on Solomon the enterprise of building the temple and of carrying it to completion. With abundance of means and preparations so large already made, one might have supposed a young king and a young man would have needed little pressure and little exhortation. Nevertheless, in the manifest presence of David's words, it is very far from impossible to suppose the dangers and temptations of Solomon's position as constituting a serious risk.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-19.</span> - These hints respecting the parts of the building that was to be, and respecting the furniture of it, will come in for fuller consideration in the fuller treatment of them, found in the narration of the actual construction of the building in 2 Chronicles compared with <a href="../../par/2_kings/6.htm">2 Kings 6</a>, etc. It is evident that David desired to make a solemn and set business of handing over even the patterns and plans. Nor is this under any circumstances wonderful, but least of all considering their Divine origin. The Divine original of the tabernacle and all its belongings (<a href="../../par/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-30</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>) was not to be a neglected precedent as regards the greater temple. It is said that "David gave" these "patterns to Solomon his son" (ver. 11), and the form in which he gave them is explained in ver. 19. There we read, "The whole in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he made me to understand - all the works of this pattern." Whatever we generally accept respecting the <span class="accented">writing</span> of the tables of the Law by the finger of God (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>), is at all events open for acceptance here. At the same time, the phraseology of our nineteenth verse is certainly not so uncompromising-as that of the references just instanced from the Books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The words of ver. 19 may be satisfied by the meaning that David was in such manner and degree "in the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>), that in the writing and the drawing of patterns his hand was entirely under the guidance of that Spirit. In either alternative, to hand over such documents and such "patterns" must have been felt by David and all present an act of which much should be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The <span class="cmt_word">patterns</span> of six parts of the future building are here delivered over to Solomon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="cmt_word">porch</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-7.htm">Ezekiel 40:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, where we read that the length was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty cubits; 2 Chronicles 8:12; 15:8; 29:7, 17); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> rang generally, but in this verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is all that appears.

Such manifest stress has been laid upon the two facts - that the patterns were of God's giving, and that they were now in such form that they could be given over into the hands of Solomon - that such an interpretation seems inadmissible. Rather translate, <span class="cmt_word">And the pattern of all which was by the spirit with him.
