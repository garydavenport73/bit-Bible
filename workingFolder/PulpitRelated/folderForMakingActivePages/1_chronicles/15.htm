They also direct fresh attention to the sources upon which they drew. The history of the preparations made for the reception of the ark, and for its safe and religious escort into the city, is now proceeded with. These preparations occupied the three months, or part of the three months, spoken of in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>. The <span class="cmt_word">houses</span> may have been both his own (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>) and the buildings referred to in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>. The old tent, or <span class="accented">tabernacle</span>, is repeatedly alluded to, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>. It will be remembered that the tabernacle established by Joshua at Shiloh remained there till the time of Eli, and the ark within it (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>). Afterwards we find it removed to Nob, for there David ate the shewbread (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>). From thence, very possibly after the savage slaughter of the priests by the order of Saul, it was removed, and we find it at Gibeon, according to the above references. Here at Gibeon was an altar and "high place," which, in the earlier time of Solomon, formed the chief religious centre. The wanderings of the ark already given from Shiloh, through Philistia to Beth-she-mesh, Kirjath-jearim, Perez-uzzah, now land it in this tent in Jerusalem. It is no more sheltered in the tabernacle. But the tabernacle, as well as the ark, was ultimately brought to the new-built temple of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse together with vers. 12-15 show that the severe lesson of the destruction of Uzzah had been laid to heart, and had made David supremely anxious to take better counsel of the Law. Uzzah, though possibly the son of a Levite, more probably of a Hivite (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7, 17</a>), was not a priest, nor is there any sufficient evidence that he was a Levite; and most distinct was the order of the Law (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-51.htm">Numbers 1:51-53</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-29.htm">Numbers 3:29-32</a>; 4:15420), that "when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." So the sons of Kohath are to come to bear the sanctuary with all its sacred vessels, "but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die." Many things were allowed to be carried on waggons under the charge of the Gershonites and Merarites, but the strict contents of the sanctuary were to be borne in a specified manner by the Kohathites.

The mention of the six representative Levitical families follows. That of <span class="cmt_word">Kohath</span> (ver. 5) takes the lead, because, though second in order of birth (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16-19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1-30</a>), its priestly importance gave it always first rank. To the same head belonged also three of the remaining five families, viz. <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span> (ver. 9) and <span class="cmt_word">Uzziel</span> (ver. 10), who were brothers, as being beth sons of Kohath (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>); and <span class="cmt_word">Elizaphan</span>, who, though son of Uzziel (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-22.htm">Exodus 6:22</a>), had come to represent a distinct family (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30</a>). The other two required to complete the six are <span class="cmt_word">Asaiah</span> (ver. 6) of the house of Merari, and <span class="cmt_word">Joel</span> (ver. 7) of the house of Gershom. The representatives, then, of these six families, with the company of the brethren belonging to each of them, and the two priests <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Abiathar</span> (ver. 11), are now summoned into the presence of David, to receive a short but special charge.

These "sanctifyings" consisted of different observances, according to the person and the occasion, but largely of ablutions of the body, washing of the clothes, and keeping separate from all natural and ceremonial causes of uncleanness in ordinary cases of Levitical service. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may bring up the ark</span>. The word here employed for "bring" is not the same with the "carry" of vers 1 and 2. But the following verses (13-15) seem to intimate that, whatever the exact reason for which Uzzah had been peremptorily cut off, the Levites had also been to blame in not sanctifying themselves to <span class="accented">carry</span> the ark by its staves in the way originally appointed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13</a></div><div class="verse">For because ye <i>did it</i> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - This verse purports to say that the Levites had been deficient in their duty in the double sense of not having themselves exclusively undertaken the removal of the ark, and not having executed that removal after the due order.

It is plain that from the first stress was laid upon the rings and the staves through them by which the ark was to be carried, as also the "table of shittim wood" (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-26.htm">Exodus 25:26-28</a>) and the "altar" (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-4.htm">Exodus 27:4-7</a>) and the "altar of incense" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-4.htm">Exodus 30:4, 5</a>). However, these rings and staves were not found in the permanent furniture of the temple, except only for the ark.

This word is either altogether an accidental interpolation, or a remnant of some statement of the patronymic character regarding Zechariah.

Yet their connection in a series of four divisions of musical duty does throw some light upon them. These four verses manifestly purport to describe a special part to be performed by those of whom they respectively speak. Gesenius explains <span class="accented">psalteries on Alamoth</span> to mean such instruments as savoured of virgin tone or pitch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> high as compared with the lower pitch of men's voices. This lower pitch he considers intimated by the word "Sheminith," literally, <span class="accented">the eighth</span>, or <span class="accented">octave</span>. The added expression, "to excel," need scarcely be, with him, understood to mean "to take the lead musically," but may be read generally to mark their supassing quality.

There is considerable diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this word. Some think its meaning to be "in the carrying (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>)" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the ark. Its exact position here seems not unfavourable to such interpretation. On the other hand, its position in ver. 27 seems conclusively to point to the translation of the Septuagint and of our Authorized Version in this place as the correct one. Dr. Murphy, however, to escape this, thinks "with the singers" in ver. 27 to be a "copyist's inadvertent repetition." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-23.htm">1 Chronicles 15:23</a></div><div class="verse">And Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Berechiah and Elkanah</span>.

These trumpets were of solid silver, of one piece, were straight and narrow, and had an expanded mouth. They are found on the arch of Titus, and are described by Josephus. On the other hand, the trumpet, more correctly rendered "cornet" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, as distinguished from our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which was used for proclaiming the jubilee, for announcing the new year for sentinel and other special signals, and for war, was shaped like a ram's horn, and probably made of the same. The particular appropriateness of the use of the former on this occasion is manifest, in addition to the fact that they were the appointed trumpets for the journeying of the camp and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> of the ark itself at a time so essentially religious as the present. Yet, as we learn from ver. 28, the latter were used as well, and <span class="accented">cymbals</span>, <span class="accented">psalteries</span>, and <span class="accented">harps. The</span> original number of the silver trumpets was two only, and they were to be sounded strictly by the anointed priests, sons of Aaron, at all events when their employment was within the sanctuary. Their employment, however, grew far more general, and we find (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>) that their number had risen to a hundred and twenty (so too <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>).

The fine linen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span>), in the first clause of this verse, is not the same with that (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span>) in the last clause. The first clause of this verse (which makes the last clause somewhat redundant) bears some resemblance in letters to the <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a> <span class="bible_ref">fourteenth verse</span> of 2 Samuel 6. first clause, which means, "and David danced with all his might," and the two clauses exactly answer to one another in position - another suggestion of an uncertain text here.

Neither of the words here rendered <span class="cmt_word">dancing and playing</span> (but which would be better rendered "leaping and dancing") is the same with those employed in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14, 16</a>, where our Authorized Version rendering is "dancing" and "leaping and dancing" respectively. The word in both of those verses that represents the dancing, does correctly so represent, bet is a somewhat generic form, as it carries the idea of dancing in a circle. The reason of Michal "despising David in her heart" can only be found in the unreason and the irreligion of that heart itself. She was a type of not a few, who despise devotion, enthusiasm, and above all practical liberality and generosity, on the part of any individual of their own family, when these are shown to Christ and his Church, and when they think they may be a trifle the poorer for it, or when they feel that the liberality and devotion of another exposes their own "poverty" in both these respects. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_chronicles/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
