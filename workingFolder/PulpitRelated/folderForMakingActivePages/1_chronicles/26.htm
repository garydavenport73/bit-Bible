And if at any time of the history it were the case that these ninety-three were the leaders of groups among the total of "four thousand porters," it would put exactly forty-two under each of these ninety-three, leaving but one over. This number ninety-three, meantime, does not agree with the <span class="accented">two hundred and twelve</span> of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>.

At the same time, no little light may be thrown on this subject by noticing that the porters numbered in Zerubbabel's time one <span class="accented">hundred and thirty-nine</span> (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>); and that the number one <span class="accented">hundred and seventy-two</span> is given for them by Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>). The conclusion may well be that the numbers varied in David's time and the other times severally;and that the date in question (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>) was not the same with the date of David in our present chapter, but was a subsequent date nearer the time of the Captivity. There is, therefore, no special ground for doubting the accuracy of the numbers given in this chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-13.htm">1 Chronicles 26:13</a></div><div class="verse">And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.</div><div class="comm">

A special note is made of the care taken for the house of <span class="cmt_word">Asuppim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of "gatherings" or "stores." For all that we know of this "house," we seem to be left to the verses (15, 17) of this passage, and to the expression (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>), "the storehouses, or stores of the gates" (though the Authorized Version, the "thresholds" of the gates), which would have been more intelligible had it been reversed, "the gates of the stores." Presumably it was a building for keeping safe certain of the sacred property, and was situated south of the temple, and, judging from ver. 17, had two doorways. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">seniorum concilium. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To Shuppim</span>. Nothing can be made of this word in this connection, as a proper name, though we have it (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12, 15</a>) as such. It is now generally rejected, as probably due to the error of some transcriber, whose eye may have been caught again by the last two syllables of the closely preceding "Asuppim." But some would place it as the last word of the previous verse, and make it amplify the meaning of <span class="accented">Asuppim</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "gatherings for stores." <span class="cmt_word">Shallecheth</span>. By derivation, this word means "sending or throwing down." Hence some call it, "the refuse gate." The situation of it is, however, defined here, as by the <span class="cmt_word">causeway of the going up</span>, and would seem to render such an interpretation less likely. According to Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), this causeway is still traceable: it runs up from the central valley of the town to the sacred site west of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>); and Grove would identify the "gate of Shallecheth" with the present <span class="accented">Bab Silsileh.</span> The Septuagint translates <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate of the temple-cell, which word they could get from the inverting of the order of the first two letters of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Shallecheth.</span> The Septuagint then mutts the following word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Ward against ward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. watch with watch.</span> The expression up- pears to refer to the fact that Hosah's lot threw to him the charge of a double position.

These words, with forms akin to them, are often found in the Targums, but not elsewhere in the Scriptures. The nearest approach to the meaning of the word, as yet discovered, is a "suburb." The connection may just do as much as indicate that, whereas four porters kept the causeway gate, the Parbar gate was in closer proximity to the temple that was to be, but what this Parbar really was is not yet ascertained. Possibly it is the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of Josephus ('Ant.,' 15. 11:5).

The very first use of this word to signify a place where treasures were kept is in <a href="../../par/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19, 24</a>. The same word is used for either the place or the treasures kept in it. Not found in the Books of Samuel, the word often occurs in the two Books of Kings and of Chronicles, once in Ezra, several times in Nehemiah, etc. In our next chapter (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-25.htm">1 Chronicles 27:25, 27, 28</a>) it appears in the Authorized Version <span class="accented">as</span> "<span class="accented">storehouses"</span> and "cellars<span class="cmt_word">."

Samuel, Saul, Abner, and Joab had then been unwittingly finding some of the treasures now disposed to highest use by David.

For the <span class="cmt_word">officers and judges</span>, see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5-11</a>. The too generic term "officers" (<a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6-19</a>: <a href="../../par/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>, etc.) may be advantageously superseded by the word "scribes." These scribes and judges, it appears, were taken from the families of Izhar and Hebron alone, without any Amramite or Uzzielite of the other Kohathites, and without any Gershonite or Merarite of the other Levites. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-30.htm">1 Chronicles 26:30</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, <i>were</i> officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> -  Were <span class="cmt_word">officers among them of Israel.</span> The simpler translation would be, <span class="accented">were for the superintending of Israel</span> (compare the verb in ver. 32). <span class="cmt_word">On this side Jordan westward</span>; literally, <span class="accented">across Jordan westward</span>, the point of view being from the Persian side. So <a href="../../par/ezra/4-16.htm">Ezra 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-6.htm">Ezra 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7</a>; but also <a href="../../par/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-7.htm">Joshua 22:7</a>, when the point of view was that of those who had still to cross the Jordan to the west. The expression, in all <span class="cmt_word">the business of the Lord</span>, is probably no mere reminiscence of the temple or semi-sacred business (such as the gathering of the tithes, etc.), but rather the recognition of the fact that all that pertained to the right discharge of the civil duties of an Israelite's life lay within that description. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-31.htm">1 Chronicles 26:31</a></div><div class="verse">Among the Hebronites <i>was</i> Jerijah the chief, <i>even</i> among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers.

He and his brethren were now appointed to the superintendence of the two tribes and a half eastward of Jordan, while "Hashabiah and his brethren" fulfilled the like duties westward of Jordan The number of those east of Jordan constituted overseers seems large in proportion to those mentioned on the west; but we must bear in mind that the numbers of Chenaniah and their range of sphere are not stated. These will presumably complete the six thousand of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a>. Otherwise we have but to fall back on the conviction that the present account is imperfect as well as brief. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-32.htm">1 Chronicles 26:32</a></div><div class="verse">And his brethren, men of valour, <i>were</i> two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Chief fathers</span>. The number of chief fathers mentioned in this verse leads Keil to point out very justly that here at least the designation cannot mean anything beyond the fathers of individual families - cannot mean the heads of those groups which are composed of all the branches or relations of one house. They must have been heads of households (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), not heads of <span class="accented">fathers</span> <span class="accented">houses</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). The ambiguity is owing to the use of the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> in ver. 32, the latter of which words has so often supposed the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> to precede it, coupled to it by a hyphen. Adding the numbers of vers. 30 and 32, we find a total of Hebronite "officers and judges" amounting to four thousand four hundred. The remaining sixteen hundred to complete the" six thousand" were drawn from the Gershon, Amram, and Izhar families. Some of the Uzzielites probably helped the Hebronites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_chronicles/25.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 25"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 25" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/27.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 27"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 27" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
