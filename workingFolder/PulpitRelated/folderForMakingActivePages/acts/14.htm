There is great resemblance between this miracle of healing, and that of the lame man laid at the gate of the temple, who was healed by Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2-10</a>), and, not unnaturally, considerable identity of expression in the narratives. Both men were lame from their birth; the apostles fastened their eyes upon both; both, when healed, leaped and walked; and in both cases the miracle 'had a great effect upon the multitudes who beheld it. Zeller (vol. it. p. 6), with characteristic recklessness, infers that "this narrative was, merely in imitation of the early miraculous story of Peter;" and so relegates both it and the subsequent narrative to the regions of fable.

It is not known what the language of Lycaonia was, whether Cappadocian, or Celtic, or Lycian; but we learn incidentally from Stephanus Byzantinus, that there was a Lycaonian language, for he tells us that <span class="accented">Delbia</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> some write the name Derbe) was the Lycaonian for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a juniper tree or berry. No other Lycaonian word is known (see "Jablouskii Disquis. de Ling. Lycaon," in Stephan., 'Thesaur.'). The Lycaoniaus doubtless understood Greek as the language of intercommunication all over Roman Asia, but among themselves would speak their native dialect. The belief that <span class="cmt_word">the gods were come down in the likeness of men</span>, and that these gods were Jupiter and Hermes, or Mercury, was most natural to Lycaonians, who were conversant with, and doubtless believed, the Phrygian legend of Philemon and Baucis, who entertained hospitably Jupiter and Hermes, when no one else would take them in, and whose cottage was by the gods turned into a temple (when all the neighborhood was drowned by a flood), of which they were made priest and priestess during life, and simultaneously metamorphosed into an oak and lime tree when their life ended (Ovid, 'Metamorph.,'8:611, etc.). Ovid places the scene of the legend at Tyana, the site of which has been ascertained by Hamilton to be near Erekli, in Cappadocia, close to the borders of Lycaonia. The moral drawn in the legend itself seems to have been that which influenced the people of Lycaonia in their conduct towards the two strangers: "Cura pii dis sunt, et qui coluere coluntur," which may be Englished, "Them that honor me I will honor" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).

The same fickleness of the multitude which led those who had cried, "Hosanna!" to turn round and say, "Crucify him!" here led those who would have worshipped Paul as a god, now to stone him as a blasphemer.

In the choice of an apostle the election was by lot (<a href="../../par/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>), in the appointment of deacons the choice was by the people, how indicated we are not told (<a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>); the question here, on which commentators disagree, is whether the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> indicates voting by the people, selection by the apostles, or simple creation or appointment.
