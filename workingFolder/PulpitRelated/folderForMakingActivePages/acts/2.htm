The idea of the <span class="accented">cloven tongue, i.e.</span> a tongue parted into two, which is thought to have been the origin of the miter, is not suggested either by the Greek or by the circumstances, and is clearly a mistaken one. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means <span class="accented">distributing themselves</span> or <span class="accented">being distributed.</span> From the central apparition, or rather place of sound, they saw issuing forth many several tongues, looking like small flames of fire, and one such tongue sat upon each one of the brethren or disciples present. <span class="cmt_word">Each one</span>.

For not only must the <span class="accented">all</span> of ver. 1 refer to the same company as was described in the preceding chapter (vers. 15-26), but it is quite clear in ver. 15 of this chapter that Peter and the eleven (ver. 14), standing up separate from the body of the disciples, say of them, "These are not drunken, as ye suppose;" which is a demonstration that those of whom they thus spoke had been speaking with tongues (see also <a href="../../par/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>). St. Augustine, too, says that the hundred and twenty all received the Holy Spirit. To the same effect Meyer, Wordsworth, Alford (who adds, "Not the hundred and twenty only, but all the believers in Christ then congregated at Jerusalem;" so also Lange). Farrar well remarks, "It was the consecration of a whole Church to be all of them a chosen generation, a royal priest- hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people" ('Life of St. Paul,' <a href="../../par/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>.). Lange says, "Not only the apostles, but all the disciples, were filled with the Holy Ghost. There is a universal priesthood of all believers, and the Holy Ghost is the anointing which consecrates and qualifies for this priesthood" ('On the Acts,' Clark's edit., p. 67).

St. Paul speaks of them as "the tongues of men and of angels" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>), and as "kinds of tongues" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). His habitual phrase is "speaking in [or <span class="accented">with</span>] <span class="accented">a tongue</span> [or <span class="accented">tongues</span>]" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2, 4-6</a>, etc.), and the verb is always <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, as here. What these tongues were on this occasion we are explicitly informed in vers. 6, 8, and 11. They were the tongues of the various nationalities present at the feast - Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Phrygians, Arabians, etc. This is so clearly and so distinctly stated that it is astonishing that any one should deny it who accepts St. Luke's account as historical. The only room for doubt is whether the speakers spoke in these divers languages, or the hearers heard in them though the speakers spoke in only one tongue. But not to mention that this is far more difficult to imagine, and transfers the miracle from those who had the Holy Spirit to those who had it not, it is against the plain language of the text, which tells us that "they began to speak with other tongues," and that "every man heard them speaking in his own language." "Speaking," said they, "in our own tongues the mighty works of God." There <span class="accented">may</span>, indeed, have been something ecstatic besides in these utterances, but there is no reference to such made either by St. Luke or by the audience whose words he reports. The narrative before us does not hint at any after use of the gift of tongues for missionary purposes. In <a href="../../par/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-15.htm">Acts 11:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>, as well as in the passages above referred to in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the speaking with tongues is always spoken of - often in connection with prophecy - simply as a gift and a manifestation (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>) of the power of the Holy Spirit. In this case and in <a href="../../par/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a> the subject-matter of the utterance is the greatness of God's works; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2</a> it is" mysteries;" in ver. 15, "prayers and psalms;" in ver. 16 it is "blessing" and "thanksgiving" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). But nowhere, either in Holy Scripture or in the Fathers of the three first centuries, is the gift of tongues spoken of in connection with preaching to foreign nations (see Alford's just remarks). Farrar ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 98-101) takes the same view, but is much less distinct in his conception of what is meant here by speaking with tongues. He adheres to the view of Schneckenburger, that "the tongue was, from its own force and significance, intelligible equally to all who heard it;" he agrees with the dictum of Neander that "any foreign languages which were spoken on this occasion were only something accidental, and not the essential element of the language of the Spirit." He says, "The voice they uttered was awful in its range, in its tones, in its modulations, in its startling, penetrating, almost appalling power; the words they spoke were exalted, intense, passionate, full of mystic significance; the language they used was not their ordinary and familiar tongue, but was Hebrew, or Greek, or Latin, or Aramaic, or Persian, or Arabic, as some overpowering and unconscious impulse of the moment might direct... and among these strange sounds... there were some which none could interpret, which rang on the air like the voice of barbarous languages, and which ... conveyed no definite significance beyond the fact that they were reverberations of one and the same ecstasy." The writer seems to suggest that when any real language was spoken it was one more or less known previously by the speaker, and that in other cases it was no language at all, only thrilling emotional sounds. Renan's view of the day of Pentecost is a carious specimen of rationalistic interpretation. "One day when the brethren were come together there was a tempest. A violent wind burst open the windows, and the sky was one sheet of fire. In that climate tempests are often accompanied by an extraordinary amount of electric light. The atmosphere is on all sides furrowed with jets of flame. On this occasion, whether the electric fluid actually passed through the room, or whether the faces of all present were suddenly lit up by an extremely bright flash of lightning, all were convinced that the Holy Spirit had entered their assembly, and had sat upon the head of each in the shape of a tongue of fire... In these moments of ecstasy, the disciple possessed by the Spirit uttered sounds 'inarticulate and incoherent, which the hearers fancied were the words of a strange language, and in their simplicity tried to interpret They listened eagerly to the medley of sounds, and explained them by their own extemporaneous thoughts. Each of them had recourse to his own native <span class="accented">patois</span> to supply some meaning to the unintelligible accents, and generally succeeded in affixing to them the thoughts that were uppermost in his own mind" ('Les Apotres,' pp. 66-68). Elsewhere (pp. 64, 65) he suggests that the whole conception of <span class="accented">speaking with tongues</span> arose from the anticipation on the part of the apostles that great difficulty would arise in propagating the gospel from the impossibility of learning to speak the necessary languages. The solution with some was that, under the ecstasy caused by the Holy Spirit, the hearers would be able to translate what they heard into their own tongue; others rather thought that by the same power the apostles would be able to speak any dialect they pleased at the moment. Hence the conception of the day of Pentecost as described by St. Luke! Meyer, again, fully admits, as "beyond all doubt," that St. Luke intended to narrate that the persons possessed by the Spirit spoke in foreign languages previously unknown by them; but adds that "the sudden communication of a facility of speaking foreign languages is neither logically possible nor psychologically and morally conceivable" (a pretty bold assertion); and therefore he sets down St. Luke's account of what occurred as "a later legendary formation," based upon the existing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.  Zeller, traveling a little further on the same road, comes to the conclusion that "the narrative before us is not based on any definite fact" (p. 205). Leaving, however, these fanciful varieties of incredulous criticism, and interpreting the statements of this chapter by the later spiritual gifts as seen in the Church of Corinth, we conclude that the" tongues" were sometimes "tongues of men," foreign languages unknown to the speakers, and of course unintelligible to the hearers unless any were present, as was the case on the day of Pentecost, who knew the language; and sometimes languages not of earth but of heaven, "<span class="accented">tongues</span> of angels." But there is no evidence whatever of their being mere gibberish as distinct from <span class="accented">language</span>, or being language coined at the moment by the Holy Ghost. All that St. Paul says to the Corinthians is fully applicable to any language spoken when there were none present who understood it. The significance of the miracle seems to be that it points to the time when all shall be one in Christ, and shall all speak and understand the same speech; and not only all men, but men and angels, "<span class="accented">the</span> whole family in heaven and earth," "<span class="accented">things</span> in the heavens and things upon the earth" all gathered together in one in Christ. It may also not improbably have been used occasionally, as it was on the day of Pentecost, to convey doctrine, knowledge, or exhortation, to foreign people; but there is no distinct evidence that this was the case.

This title includes both the Jews of Judaea and all those of the dispersion, to whatever tribe they belonged. <span class="cmt_word">Approved of God</span>. Observe the distinct reference to the miracles of Christ, as the proofs that he came from God, the authenticating evidences of his Divine mission. So St. Peter again, in his address to Cornelius, declares how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (<a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). The miracles of the gospel are, and were intended to be, a demonstration of the truth of Christianity, and it is at their peril that Christians allow themselves to give up this argument at the bidding of the skeptic. <span class="cmt_word">Mighty works and wonders and signs</span>. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> are <span class="accented">powers</span>, acts of healing and such like, done by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit (see the above reference to <a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">wonders</span> or <span class="accented">portents</span>, such as are spoken of by the Prophet Joel, "wonders in heaven above," the darkening of the sun, the discoloration or the moon, or any ether wonder considered only with reference to its portentous character; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">signs</span>, not necessarily miraculous, but things which are proofs, either by their miraculous character or from the time or mode of their occurrence, of the truth of the things spoken. "Miracles, wonders, and signs" occur together in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>.

So we read <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "Through [or 'by'] whom also he made the worlds." And so our Lord said of himself, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work;" and "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do" (<a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 19</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).

As Mediator, Christ did all things by his Father's appointment, and for his Father's glory, Even as ye yours, elves know. Mark the confidence with which Peter appeals to their personal knowledge of the miracles of Christ. This was a fitting preparation for the announcement of that mighty power, wonder, and sign which he was now about to proclaim to them - the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead.

The sixteenth psalm is ascribed to David in the title prefixed to it in the Hebrew and the LXX. Without pronouncing the titles to be infallible, we must confess that they carry great weight with them in the absence of any strong internal evidence against them. Meyer speaks of the psalm as "certainly later than David," and Ewald and others ascribe it to the time of the Captivity; but Hitzig thinks the internal evidence is in favor of its belonging to the time before David ascended the throne ('Speaker's Commentary'). We may safely rest on the authority of St. Peter here and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35, 36</a>), and be satisfied that it is really David's. The manner in which it is quoted by the two apostles is also very strong evidence that by the Jews of that day it was generally admitted to be a Messianic psalm.

The "hell" of the A.V. is the exact English representative of <span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The article in the Creed, "He descended into hell," is based upon this text especially, the other two alleged in support of it (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18, 19</a>) being less conclusive (see Pearson on the Creed, art. 5.).

The Hebrew word always means <span class="accented">a pit</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>); but the LXX. here render it <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, as if from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (in Pihel, to destroy, waste; in Hophal and Niphal, to be corrupted, spoilt, to rot). In the A.V. it is rendered <span class="accented">corruption</span>, here and in <a href="../../par/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, where it answers to "the worms," in the parallel clause. It is very probable that the LXX. are right. Nothing is more common than for Hebrew verbs to take the meaning of verbs with similar radicals. <span class="cmt_word">Holy One</span>. So the LXX. and the Keri of the Hebrew text. But the Cethib has <span class="accented">Holy Ones</span> in the plural. It is obvious that the singular, <span class="accented">Holy One</span>, agrees far better with the singulars which precede and follow <span class="accented">it - my</span> heart, <span class="accented">my</span> glory, <span class="accented">my</span> flesh, <span class="accented">my</span> soul, thou wilt show me - than the plural, which is entirely out of place.

It is a title of dignity, signifying the head of a house. It seems to be here applied to David, because he is spoken of as head of the family from which Christ sprang. Abraham was the head of the whole Hebrew race: "Abraham our father." The twelve patriarchs were the heads of their respective tribes.

In common parlance, the term is also applied to those chief persons who lived before the time of Moses, and have their record in his books. <span class="cmt_word">His tomb is with us</span>, etc. Josephus speaks of David's tomb (calling it, as St. Peter here does, his <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) as consisting of several chambers, and relates how one of these chambers was opened by the high priest Hyrcanus, who took from it three thousand talents of gold to give to Antiochus Pins, who was at that time laying siege to Jerusalem. He adds that another chamber was opened later by King Herod, who abstracted a great quantity of golden ornaments from it; but that neither of them penetrated to the vaults where the bodies of David and Solomon were deposited, because the entrance to them was so carefully concealed. He further mentions that Herod, having been terrified by the bursting out of flames, which stopped his further progress, built a most costly marble monument at the entrance of the tomb ('Jud. Ant.,' 7. 15:3; 13. 8:4; 16. 7:1). For the sense, supply "and therefore he could not be speaking of himself." The explanation follows that he was a prophet, etc.

Thy throne shall be established forever;" and in ver. 28, David speaks of it as God's promise: "Thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant." But there is no mention there of an oath. But in <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, great stress is laid upon God having sworn to David: "I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations" (vers. 3, 4); and again, ver. 35, "Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David" <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, should be read through carefully (comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>).

But it is equally clear that he is but one of the apostles; he is not set over them, but acts with them; he is not their superior, but their fellow; they are not eclipsed by his presence, but only animated by his example; inquirers after salvation do not ask at his mouth only, but of the whole college of the apostles.

It is very remarkable that at this early age of the Church's existence Christians did not deem themselves separated from their Jewish brethren, or from the Old Testament institutions. Christianity was but Judaism perfected; the gospel the full blossoming of the Law. The first Christian Jews, therefore, did not conceive of themselves as quitting the religion of their fathers, but rather hoped that their whole nation would in a short time acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ. Christian institutions, therefore - the prayers, the breaking of bread, the prophesyings and speaking with tongues, and the apostolic teachings - were supplemental to the temple service, not antagonistic to it; and the church took the place rather of the synagogue than of the temple (see 'Dict. of Bible:' "Synagogue"). <span class="cmt_word">At home.</span> This version hardly represents the true idea of the original; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> represents the private Christian place of meeting, as contrasted with the temple. The meaning is not that every disciple broke bread in his own house, but that they broke bread at the house where the Christian assemblies were held, whether one or more. We have already seen the Church gathered together "in an upper room" (<a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), in "one place," in "a house" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1, 2</a>), and "together" (ver. 44; see too <a href="../../par/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>); and we know that as the synagogue was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, house of prayer, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, the house of assemblage, so the Christian place of meeting was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the Lord's house, whence the word "<span class="accented">church."</span> (For <span class="accented">breaking bread, see</span> above, ver. 42.) They did take their food. The link of connection is the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span> or love-feast, which formed an important part of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or common life, of the early Christians. The whole description is a beautiful picture of Christian unity, piety, love, and joy.

In fact, they have no sense unless you construe them with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "those who escaped to the same place," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Church.
