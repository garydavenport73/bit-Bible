But the mention of "the apostles whom he had chosen" drew him, as it were, into the stem of his history before he was able to describe it. O Theophilus. The omission of the title "most excellent," given to Theophilus in the Gospel (<a href="../../par/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>), is one among other indications that the publication of the Acts followed very closely upon that of the Gospel. Began both to do and to teach Some take the phrase as equivalent to <span class="accented">did</span> <span class="accented">and taught</span>; <span class="accented">o</span>thers supply the sense <span class="accented">and continued</span> until the day, etc.; or, which is the same thing, supply the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span>, making the whole sense equivalent to "all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day," etc.; others again, as Bishop Wordsworth, gather St. Luke's meaning to be that in the Acts he is about to narrate the <span class="accented">continuance</span> by our Lord in heaven of the work which he only <span class="accented">began</span> on earth. Meyer thinks that, by the insertion of the word "began," the thing said or done "is in a vivid and graphic manner denoted according to its moment of commencement;" so that our Lord is represented as at one time actively beginning to heal, then to teach, then to walk on the sea, and so on. But the words "began" and "until the day" certainly suggest the beginning and the ending of our Lord's ministry, or rather the whole ministry from its beginning to its end, so that the meaning would be "of all that Jesus did and taught from first to last." To do and to teach. So the disciples on the way to Emmaus speak of Jesus as "a Prophet mighty in deed and word" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-19.htm">Luke 24:19</a>).

Doubtless, too, he had in his mind those other proofs which he records in <a href="../../par/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>, and those referred to by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>). For this sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, see <a href="../../par/acts/24-13.htm">Acts 24:13</a>, "to rove:" and Lysias's 'Oration against Eratosthenes' (p. 125), where the almost identical phrase occurs which we have here, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "I will prove both these things by many certain proofs." The A.V. rendering, "infallible proofs," was quite justified. Stephanus says, "De certo et indubitato signo dicitur apud Rhetoricos" ('Thesaurus,' 9216); and the technical meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in Aristotle is a "demonstrative proof," as opposed to a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which leaves room for doubt; and in medical writers, which is important as regards St. Luke, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the "infallible symptom."

In the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a> it is used of the staves of the ark within the veil, which "were not seen without." The idea intended to be conveyed, both by the use of this verb and by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> (by the space of), is that our Lord was not with the apostles always, as he was before the Resurrection, but that he came and again disappeared (St. Chrysostom). They were fleeting appearances spread over forty days. The nearly related substantive, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, means "a vision," and is frequently used by St. <a href="../../par/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-23.htm">Luke 24:23</a>; 26:19.

(See <a href="../../par/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>.)

St. Peter refers to this saying of the Lord's in his address to the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/11-16.htm">Acts 11:16</a>), and the record of it here may be an indication that St. Luke derived his information of these early events from Peter. A curious question arises as to the baptism of the apostles themselves. When were they baptized, and by whom? Chrysostom says, "They were baptized by John." But it is evident, from <a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>, that converts were baptized with Christian, as distinct from John's, baptism in our Lord's lifetime, and hence it may seem probable, especially considering that St. Paul was baptized, that the apostles may have been baptized by Christ (Bishop Wordsworth On <a href="../../par/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>). If so, the baptism with the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was the complement of that baptism, not the substitute for it. "In our case," says Chrysostom, "both (the baptism of water and of the Spirit) take place under one act, but then they were divided." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">They</span> <span class="accented">therefore, when</span> for <span class="accented">when they therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">him</span> for <span class="accented">of him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">dost thou</span> for <span class="accented">wilt thou</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">restore</span> for restore <span class="accented">again</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou at this time</span>, etc.? It appears from <a href="../../par/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a> and Luke 24:21, as well as from other passages, that the apostles expected the kingdom of Christ to come immediately. It was most natural, therefore, that, after the temporary extinction of this hope by the Crucifixion, it should revive with new force when they saw the Lord alive after his passion.

The description of our Lord's second advent constantly makes mention of clouds. "Behold, he cometh with clouds" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>). "One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven" (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>; and so <a href="../../par/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-27.htm">Luke 21:27</a>, etc.). We are reminded of the grand imagery of <a href="../../par/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, "Who maketh the clouds his chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind." It may be remarked that the above is by far the fullest account we have of the ascension of our Lord. St. Luke appears to have learnt some further particulars concerning it in the interval between writing his Gospel (<a href="../../par/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50-52</a>) and writing the Acts. But allusions to the Ascension are frequent (<a href="../../par/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-62.htm">John 6:62</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>, etc.). With reference to Zeller's assertion, that in St. <span class="accented">Luke's</span> Gospel the Ascension is represented as taking place on the day of the Resurrection, it may freely be admitted that the narrative in the Gospel does not mark distinctly the interval of time between the different appearances and discourses of our Lord from the day of the Resurrection to that of the Ascension. It seems to group them according to their logical connection rather than according to their chronological sequence, and to be a general account of what Jesus said between the Resurrection and the Ascension. But there is nothing whatever in the text of St. Luke to indicate that what is related in the section Luke 24:44-49 took place at the same time as the things related in the preceding verses. And when we compare with that section what is contained in <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it becomes clear that it did not. Because the words "assembling together with them," in ver. 4, clearly indicate a different occasion from the apparitions on the day of the Resurrection; and as the words in <a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-49</a> correspond with those in <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it must have been also on a different occasion that they were spoken. Again, the narrative of St. John, both in the twentieth and the twenty-first chapters, as well as that of <a href="../../par/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>, precludes the possibility of the Ascension having taken place, or having been thought to have taken place, on the day of the Resurrection, or for many days after, so that to force a meaning upon the last chapter of St. Luke's Gospel which it does not necessarily bear, and which places it at variance with St. Luke's own account in the Acts (Acts 1:3; 13:31), and with the Church traditions as preserved by St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. John, is a violent and willful transaction.

Where they were abiding. A slight change in the order of the words, as adopted in the text of the R.V., makes Peter and the other apostles the nominative case to the verb "went up," instead of, as in the A.V., to "abode." In regard to the list of the apostles which follows, it may be noticed first, that it is identical with that of <a href="../../par/luke/6-14.htm">Luke 6:14-16</a>, except in the omission of Judas Iscariot and the order in which the apostles are named. The order in Luke seems to have followed that of natural birth and association. The brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, are classed together; Philip and Bartholomew, or Nathanael, go together, and so on. But in this list John follows Peter, his close companion in missionary work (<a href="../../par/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>, etc.; Acts 4:12; 8:14); James follows instead of preceding John; and others are classed somewhat differently, for reasons probably analogous, but which we know not. Of the other lists that in <a href="../../par/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16-19</a> agrees most nearly with that before us. In all, Simon Peter stands <span class="accented">first.</span> The Jude of <a href="../../par/luke/6-16.htm">Luke 6:16</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>) and <a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a> is called <span class="accented">Thaddaeus</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a> (" Lebbaeus whose surname was Thaddaeus," A.V.) and in <a href="../../par/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>; but no doubt the persons are the same. In all the lists Philip stands fifth. In three Bartholomew is sixth, while in the list in Acts his being named after Thomas makes him seventh. In all the lists James the son of Alphaeus is ninth, and Judas Iscariot the last, except in the Acts, where he is not named, being already dead.

The only apparent discrepancies in the accounts of St. Matthew and St. Luke in regard to the purchase of the field, and the name given to it, are that, according to St. Matthew's more detailed account, it was the chief priests who actually purchased the field with Judas's money, whereas St. Luke says, less accurately, that Judas purchased it. Again, St. Matthew explains the name <span class="accented">Akel-dama as</span> being given to the field because it was the price of the "innocent blood" of Jesus betrayed by Judas, whereas St. Luke's account rather suggests that it was Judas's own blood shed in his fall which gave the name. But both accounts of the name might be true, some understanding the name in one sense and some in the other. (Compare the different accounts of the name of Beer-sheba in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a> and Genesis 26:32, 33; of the origin of the proverb, "Is Saul among the prophets?" <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11, 12</a> and 1 Sam 20:24; and other similar cases.) Though, however, there is no serious discrepancy between St. Luke and St. Matthew, it is probable, from the variations above named, that St. Luke had not seen St. Matthew's account.

Here, however, as in <a href="../../par/luke/20-42.htm">Luke 20:42</a>, it may rather mean the Book of Psalms proper.

"the bishopric of souls." This same office is called a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (a deaconship), and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> (an apostleship) in vers. 17 and 25.

The ecclesiastical names for the different offices in the Church only acquired their distinctive use later, and by the gradual growth of custom.

He began to go in and out among his apostles from the time that John baptized, and continued to do so till his ascension, the day that he was received up ("taken up" A.V.), as in ver. 11. This definition of the time of our Lord's public ministry exactly agrees with <a href="../../par/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-25</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1.htm">Mark 1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3.htm">Luke 3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-51</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Must one become a witness</span>, etc. The resurrection of Christ from the dead thus appears to be a cardinal doctrine of the gospel. The whole truth of Christ's mission, the acceptance of his sacrifice, the consequent forgiveness of sins, and all man's hopes of eternal life, turn upon it. All the sermons of the apostles recorded in the Acts and the Epistles also agree with this (see <a href="../../par/acts/2.htm">Acts 2, 3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>:56, 59; 10:39-41; 13:30, etc.; <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1.htm">1 Peter 1</a>.3; 3:21,22; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>,etc.). The great care taken to secure competent witnesses is very remarkable. A disciple who had recently joined the company might be mistaken; one who had been the daily companion of Jesus Christ for three years and a half, and knew every gesture and every feature of the Master with perfect certainty, could not be mistaken.

Joseph called <span class="cmt_word">Barsabbas</span> (or Barsabas). Nothing more is really known of him. His work for Christ has no earthly record, except that Papias (Euseb., 'H.E.,' 3:39) says that, having drunk some deadly poison, by the grace of God he sustained no harm. Eusebius elsewhere (<a href="../../par/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>) says that he and Matthias were reported to be of the seventy, which is not improbable. The derivation of the name Barsabas, or Barsabbas, is unknown; it seems to be a patronymic (son of Sabas, or Sabbas), like Bar-Tholomew, Bar-Jonas, Bar-Jesus, etc. But it might also be descriptive of his qualities, like Barnabas, Son of Consolation (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), in which case one would expect it to mean the same as <span class="cmt_word">Justus</span>, as in the case of "Thomas called <span class="accented">Didymus"</span> (<a href="../../par/john/20-4.htm">John 20:4</a>; where <span class="accented">Thomas</span> and <span class="accented">Di-dymus</span> both mean "a twin"); but no Aramean word of this signification is forthcoming. The surname Justus, with its derivatives Justinus and Justinianus, was not an uncommon Roman name. It was also borne by a Jewish historian contemporary with Josephus, Justus of Tiberias, the son of Pistus (see 'Life of Josephus,'&sect;&sect; 35, 65) and was the surname of James the Less. <span class="cmt_word">Matthias</span> not otherwise known, but said by Nicephorus to have preached and suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia. Eusebius ('H. E.,'3:24) mentions spurious Gospels "of Peter, Thomas, Matthias, and others," as quoted by heretics. A work called 'The Traditions of Matthias'is referred to by Clemens Alexandrinus ('Strom.,' 2:163).

An awful phrase, showing that every man has the place in eternity which he has made for himself in time. If the reading <span class="accented">place</span>, in the beginning of the verse, is adopted instead of the part (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of the A.V., then them is a contrast between the blessed place of apostleship, which Judas forfeited, and that of <span class="accented">traitorship</span>, which he acquired.

Some think the name of each candidate was written on a tablet, and that the first name which fell out of the urn after it had been shaken was the one chosen. Some think the lot was taken by dice. But however the taking of the lot was managed, the effect was to leave the choice to God in answer to prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 21"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
