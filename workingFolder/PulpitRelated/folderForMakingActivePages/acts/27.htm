It would appear at first sight, from <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, that he not only stayed with St. Paul during his two years' imprisonment at Rome, but was his "fellow-prisoner," if at least the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> to be taken literally. This, however, is very doubtful, because in the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:7) St. Paul calls Andronicus and Junius his "fellow-prisoners," though he was not then in prison himself; and also because, in the Epistle to Philemon (Philemon 1:23, 24), he gives this epithet to Epaphras, with the addition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> ("my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus"), and does not give it to Aristarchus, who is named in the same sentence as his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and Bishop Ellicott, on ibid.).

De Page, a French navigator, as saying, "The winds from the west which prevail in these places (Cyprus) forced us to run to the north." This is exactly what the ship in which Paul sailed did. Instead of going in a westerly direction, and leaving Cyprus on her right, she turned due north, having Cyprus on her left. It was now late in August (Farrar, p. 363).

It is a nautical term for embarking men on board ship (Thucydides, Xenophon, Lucian, etc.), and is also used by medical writers for "placing patients in a bath." The corn-vessel (<span class="accented">naris frumentaria</span>) <span class="accented">from</span> Alexandria to Italy may very probably have been driven out of its direct course by the same contrary winds which forced St. Paul to sail under Cyprus (see Howson, vol. it. p. 325, note 5), or commercial objects may have brought it to Lycia, to carry Asiatic merchandize to Rome, in addition to its cargo of Egyptian wheat - possibly "timber from the woody mountains of Lycia" (Lewin, vol. it. p. 188, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/27-7.htm">Acts 27:7</a></div><div class="verse">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Were</span> <span class="accented">come with difficulty</span> for <span class="accented">scarce were come</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">further suffering</span> for <span class="accented">suffering</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">under the lee of</span> for <span class="accented">under</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had sailed slowly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, only here).

When they had with great difficulty got as far as over against Cnidus, on the coast of Carla, the north wind which caught them made it impossible to go further north. Accordingly they struck nearly due south, and bore down upon Crete, and passing Cape Salmone, its eastern extremity, they came along the southern side of the island.

It is a nautical phrase, meaning to sail alongside of the coast. In Latin <span class="accented">legere</span> has the same meaning. The difficulty arose from their being under the lee of the island, which sheltered them from the north-west wind, but left them without any motive power. However, they managed to get as far as Fair Havens, where they anchored in the roadstead so called, near to an obscure and otherwise unknown town called Lasea, possibly the same as <span class="accented">Lasos</span>, mentioned by Pliny as one of the inland cities of Crete ('Nat.

Judas of Galilee (<a href="../../par/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>) drew "much" people after him; the Jews at Damascus conspired to kill Saul after "many" days were fulfilled (<a href="../../par/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a>); Paul and Barnabas abode "long time" at Iconium (<a href="../../par/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>); Paul talked a "long" while at Tress (<a href="../../par/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>); and they sailed slowly off the coast of Asia "many" days (ver. 7); the length, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "sufficiency" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) must depend in each case upon the standard by which it is measured. Here "much time," measured by the common experience of sailing-vessels waiting for a favorable wind, may mean one or two weeks.

The Jews considered navigation unsafe between the Feast of Tabernacles (five days after the Day of Atonement) and the Feast of Pentecost (Lewin, vol. it. p. 192, note). It became, therefore, a very serious question what they were to do. Fair Havens was an inconvenient anchorage for the winter, and not near any large town. On the other hand, if they passed beyond the shelter of Cape Matala, which lay a few miles to the east, and where the coast of Crete suddenly trends due north, they would be exposed to the violence of the Eterian westerly wind. They called St. Paul into their counsels. <span class="cmt_word">Admonished them</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, only here and ver. 22.

It is identified with almost certainty with the modern <span class="accented">Lutro</span> or <span class="accented">Loutro</span>, which is both "an admirable harbor," situated exactly where Phoenice ought to be, and further by its proximity to a village called <span class="accented">Aradhene</span>, and another called <span class="accented">Anopolis</span>, shown to be the same as.

It is found also in classical writers. <span class="cmt_word">Looking north-east and south-east.</span> The margin of the R.V. has "Greek, <span class="accented">down the southwest wind, and down the north-west."</span> This phrase has caused considerable perplexity to commentators. To say, as a recommendation of a harbor for winter quarters, that it lies or looks toward the south-west and north-west, and consequently is exposed to the most furious winter storms, is obviously impossible. If Phoenix was open to the south-west and the north-west, it would not be as commodius a place to winter in as Fair Havens was which was sheltered by Cape Matala. Two methods, therefore, have been adopted of explaining the phrase so as to make it give a reasonable sense. One, that adopted by Dean Howson and Bishop Wordsworth, viz. that it looks southwest and north-west, from the point of view of the sailor, or any one approaching it from the sea, the object upon which it looks being the land which locks it in and shelters it. The other is that supported by Alford, and adopted by the R.V., and rests upon the observation that <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are not points or' the compass, but the names of the south-west and north-west winds, and that to look down (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>) a wind is the same as looking down a stream. If the harbour looks down the south-west wind it looks toward the north-east, and if it looks down the north-west wind it looks toward the southeast. Its open side would be from northeast to south-east, it would be entirely sheltered on the south-west and north-west side. This is the explanation adopted also by Dean Plumptre. <span class="accented">The south-west wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;</span>, only here in the New Testament, but frequent in classical Greek and in the LXX. (see <a href="../../par/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>. [82, Septuagint] 26). As a point of the compass, it is the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14</a>, etc.), <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="../../par/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>, etc.), of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>). <span class="accented">The north-west wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the Latin <span class="accented">Caurus</span> or <span class="accented">Corus</span>), only here in the New Testament, and not found in Greek writers.

The meaning of this somewhat difficult phrase clearly is that given by Alford and Howson, and, on second thoughts, by Smith, viz. that a violent squall from the north-east beat down the heights and through the valleys of the island, becoming more violent when they had passed Cape Matala, and compelled them to alter their course, and run south-west before the wind towards the island of Clauda; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in a neuter sense, "struck," or "beat," or "fell," as in Homer (see Liddell and Scott). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>.

As regards the nautical sense in which St. Luke here uses the word, Dean Howson, in his excellent chapter (23.) on the 'Navigation and Ships of the Ancients,' writes as follows: - "In consequence of the extreme danger to which the ships of the ancients were exposed from leaking, it was customary to take to sea, as part of their ordinary gear, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, undergirders, which were simply ropes for passing round the hull of the ship, and thus preventing the planks from starting;" and he adds in a note that "within the last twenty years (in 1837) marble tables had been dug up in the Piraeus, containing a list of Athenian ships and an inventory of their tackle, and that they all carried, as part of their "hanging gear," <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Another great ship described by Athenaeus carried twelve such. The operation of undergirding is still occasionally performed, and is called by seamen "frap- ping." The German word is <span class="accented">umgurten</span> (Howson). Among ether recent examples (Howson, p. 33) the <span class="accented">Albion</span> was frapped with iron chains after the battle of Navarino. <span class="cmt_word">Cast upon the Syrtis</span>. The wind was driving them straight toward the Syrtis Major, "the Goodwin Sands of the Mediterranean" (Farrar), and another twenty-four hours of such a gale might bring them there. The Syrtis Major was a wide gulf off the northern coast of Africa, now the Gulf of Sidra, lying between Tunis and Tripoli, considered very dangerous from its rocks and shoals. <span class="accented">Be east upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the classical word (Homer, Herodotus, Euripides) for being driven or thrown ashore, and is used in this sense in vers. 26, 29 of this chapter, and in a slightly different sense in ver. 32. <span class="cmt_word">They lowered the gear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a very common word, variously rendered "goods," "stuff," "vessel," according to the <span class="accented">material</span> to which it is applied (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/17-31.htm">Luke 17:31</a>, etc.). In the LXX. it is used of agricultural implements (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20, 21</a>), of weapons of hunting (<a href="../../par/genesis/27-3.htm">Genesis 27:3</a>), of household furniture (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-37.htm">Genesis 31:37</a>), weapons of war (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>), instruments of music (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). This is the only passage in the Bible where it is used in its technical sense as a nautical term. In classical Greek, when applied generally to ships, it means the whole tackling, sails, ropes, yards, stores, engines, etc. The meaning, of course, is narrowed when applied to some particular part of the ship. Here, on the whole, it seems to mean the "great yard," or, if that had been already lowered, the heavy "head-gear," ropes, pulleys, and the like, which, under the circumstances, would contribute to make the ship roll and be unsteady. The word rendered "lowered" is <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It is rendered "let down" in <a href="../../par/mark/2-4.htm">Mark 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>; and ver. 30 of this chapter (A.V.). In the R.V. it is sometimes rendered "let down" and sometimes "lowered." In the LXX. it is used in the sense of "spreading" a sail (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>), which would be equivalent to "let down," if the sails were reefed at the top of the mast; and of "letting down" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). The R.V., therefore, is correct. The object of what they did was to enable the ship to go as near the wind as possible, and with as little straining and rolling as possible. The operation is called by sailors "lying to." <span class="cmt_word">Were driven</span> (see ver. 15).

The freight here mentioned may have been heavy packages of merchandise other than the main cargo of wheat (see ver. 6, note).

There is great difference of opinion as to what the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> means here. Smith thinks the main spar is meant, "the huge mainyard," and Farrar adopts his view, which he thinks is strengthened by the use of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (for he adopts the T.R.), implying one single act, and showing, by the use of the first person, that it was the act of the whole crew united. Alford thinks that it means all the furniture, beds, and movables of all kinds, and <span class="accented">so</span> Wordsworth and Meyer. Wetstein explains it of the passengers' baggage. Howson thinks it unlikely they would have thrown away a great spar which would have supported twenty or thirty men in the water in the event of the ship foundering. Schleusner renders it "apparatus quo navis erat instructa." <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, and it is difficult to speak decisively. But the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and the general use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> in classical Greek favors the interpretation "the ship's furniture" ("meubles et ustensiles," Renan).

They pretended, therefore, that they wished to let down more anchors from the bow; and let down the boat, as if with that intention, being prepared to jump in and make for the shore, leaving the ship to be wrecked, with all on board her.

The ship of Alexandria described by Lucian is calculated to have been of above a thousand tons. The mention of the number brings before us a striking picture of so many persons at St. Paul's bidding, in the midst of so great a danger, taking a cheerful and leisurely meal together, in dependence upon a speedy deliverance promised to them in God s Name. It also adds another vivid touch to the picture of the eye-witness of what he relates. Dean Plumptre well suggests that St. Luke very likely counted the crew on the. occasion of their being all assembled together for the first time.

Meyer and others think it was merely "the ship's provision," and that, considering the number of persons in the ship, and the little consumption during the last fortnight, the weight of what was left would be considerable. They add that the cargo had been already thrown overboard in ver. 18. Others, as Howson, following Smith and Penroso, Farrar, Lewin, and many older commentators, with more reason, understand "the wheat" to mean the ship's cargo from Alexandria to Rome; they think it had been impossible to get at it while the ship was drifting; and that, even had it been possible, it was the last thing they would have recourse to. But now, when it was impossible to save the ship, and the only chance of saving their lives was to run her on the beach, it was an absolute necessity to lighten the ship as much as possible. They therefore cast her freight of Alexandrian corn into the sea, and waited for daylight (see note to ver. 18).

This verse, so obscure before, has been made intelligible by the masterly labors of Smith, of Jordan Hill.

So also in the LXX., where it is of frequent use, it means "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "<span class="accented">put</span> away," "<span class="accented">remove</span>," and the like. In classical Greek it means to "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "take off," "strip off."

These paddle-rudders had been hoisted up and lashed, lest they should foul the anchors at the stern. But now, when the free use of them was absolutely necessary to steer the ship toward the beach, they unloosed the lashings, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span> "the bands of the rudders," and at the same time they hoisted up the foresail. <span class="cmt_word">The foresail</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, a word found only here in this sense, but used in Vitruvius for a "pulley," and so explained in Ducange.

The explanation of this "place where two seas met" is as follows: - As the ship stood at anchor in the bay on the north-east side of the island, it would have the Koura Point (<span class="accented">Ras el-Kaura</span>) on its left, and on entering deeper into the bay westward, the little island of Salmonetta, or Selmoon, otherwise called Gzeier, would lie on its right, and would appear to be part of the island of Malta, from which it is separated by a narrow channel about a hundred yards in width. When, however, she was just coming upon the beach for which she was making, she would come opposite to this open channel, and the sea from the north would break upon her and meet the sea on the south side of the island, where the ship was. Here, then, <span class="cmt_word">they ran the vessel aground</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, or, according to the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, is only found here in the Bible; but it is the regular word for running a ship aground, or ashore, in classical writers. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> has exactly the same meaning. The simple verbs <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> are also both in use for running a ship to land. <span class="cmt_word">The foreship struck</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, here only in the Bible, but very common in classical Greek.

"A ship impelled by the force of a gale into a creek with a bottom such as that laid down in Admiral Smyth's chart of St. Paul's Bay, would strike a bottom of mud graduating into tenacious clay, into which the forepart would fix itself and be held fast, whilst the stern was exposed to the force of the waves" (Smith, p. 144).

And thus ended the eventful voyage of about four hundred and eighty miles (as laid down in the charts) from Clauda to the Point of Koura on the north coast of Malta. It is one of the striking proofs of the identity of Melita with Malta, that the rate at which it is calculated that a large ship laying to in a gale would drift in twenty-four hours, viz. thirty-six miles, multiplied by thirteen and a half (the number of days occupied by the voyage), gives four hundred and eighty-six miles as the whole distance. (36X13.5   =   486) Smith thinks that the coincidence between "the actual bearing of St. Paul's Bay from Clauda, and the direction in which the ship must have driven," with the wind blowing in the quarter we know it did," is, if possible, still more striking" (pp. 127, 128). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/26.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 26"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 26" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/28.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 28"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 28" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
