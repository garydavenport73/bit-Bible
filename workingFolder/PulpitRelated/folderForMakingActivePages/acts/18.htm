But as the double journey of the Beroeans, who accompanied him to Athens, back to Beraea, and of Timothy from Beraea to Athens, amounted to above five hundred miles (Lewin, p. 268), we cannot suppose it to have been less than a month; and it may have been a good deal more. His reasonings in the synagogue with the Jews and devout Greeks, apparently on successive sabbaths, his daily disputations in the Agora, apparently not begun till after he had "waited" some time for Silas and Timothy, the knowledge he had acquired of the numerous temples and altars at Athens, and the phrase with which this chapter begins, all indicate a stay of some length. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Corinth</span>. If by land, a forty miles' or two days' journey, through Eleusis and Megara; if by sea, a day's sail. Lewin thinks he came by sea, and that it was in winter, and that possibly one of the shipwrecks mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a> may have occurred at this time. <span class="accented">Corinth</span>, at this time a Roman colony, the capital of the province of Achaia, and the residence of the proconsul. It was a great commercial city, the center of the trade of the Levant, and consequently a great resort of the Jews. It had a very large Greek population. Ancient Corinth had been destroyed by Mummins, surnamed Achaicus, R.C. 146, and remained waste (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>) many years. Julius Caesar founded a Roman colony on the old site (Howson), "consisting principally of freedmen, among whom were great numbers of the Jewish race." Corinth, as a Roman colony, had its duumviri, as appears by coins of the reign of Claudius (Lewin, p. 270.

Whether the Jewish family residing in Pontus took the name of Aquila from any of these Romans is not known. Aquila, the translator of the Old Testament into Greek about A.D. , was also a Jew of Pontus, the old kingdom of Mithridates. That there was a considerable colony of Jews in Pontus appears also from <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Priscilla</span>.

Prisca is a not uncommon name for Roman women. The masculine Priscus occurs very frequently. Aquila and Priscilla were among the most active Christians, and the most devoted friends of St. Paul (vers. 18, 26; <a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>); and were evidently persons of culture as well as piety.

But it occurs in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>, and in the apocryphal books repeatedly, and in Polybius. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which is also used by the LXX. and the Apocrypha and in classical Greek for "new," is used only once in the New Testament, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>. It means properly "newly killed," hence anything "recent," "fresh, or "new." Both the adjective and the adverb are very common in medical writings. <span class="cmt_word">Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome</span>. Suetonius mentions the fact, but unfortunately does not say in what year of Claudius's reign it took place. His account is that, in consequence of frequent disturbances and riots among the Jews at the instigation of Chrestus, Claudius drove them from Rome. It seems almost certain, as Renan says, especially combining Tacitus's account ('Annal.,' 15:44) of the spread of Christianity in the city of Rome before the time of Nero, that <span class="accented">Chrestus</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>,) is only a corruption of the name Christ, similar to that found on three or four inscriptions before the time of Constantine, where Christians are called <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, and to the formation of the French word <span class="accented">Chretien</span> - in old French <span class="accented">Chrestien</span>; and that the true account of these riots is that they were attacks of the unbelieving Jews upon Christian Jews, similar to these at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.), at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="../../par/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>), at Iconium and Lystra (<a href="../../par/acts/14.htm">Acts 14</a>.), and at Thessalonica and Beraea (<a href="../../par/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.). The Romans did not discriminate between Jews and Christian Jews, and thought that those who called Christ their King were fighting under his leadership (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>; see Renan, 'St. Paul,' p. 101). Tertullian and Lactantius (quoted by Lewin, p. 274) both speak of the vulgar pronunciation, Chres-<span class="accented">tianus</span> and <span class="accented">Chrestus.</span> Howson also adopts the above explanation. But Meyer thinks that Chrestus was, as Suetonius says, a Jewish leader of insurrection at Rome. The question bears on the passage before us chiefly as the solution does or does not prove the existence of Christians at Rome at this time, and affects the probability of Aquila and Priscilla being already Christians when they came to Corinth, before they made St. Paul's acquaintance.

But the fact of such manufacture would equally lead persons who were living in Cilicia to exercise the trade of making tents of the cloth so manufactured. St. Paul alludes to his manual labor in <a href="../../par/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33-35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9</a>.

If there were extant a letter of Paul to the Beraeans, it would probably mention his sending back Silas to them, just as the Epistle to the Thessalonians mentions his sending Timothy to them. Now they both come to Corinth from <span class="accented">Macedonia</span>, which includes Beraea and Thessalonica. If they came by sea, they would probably sail together from Dium to Cenchreae (see <a href="../../par/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Was constrained by the Word</span>.

St. Luke has not infrequently a use of words peculiar to himself. The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">instabat verbo</span>, seems so to understand it. It was probably soon after the arrival of Silas and Timothy that St. Paul wrote his First Epistle to the Thessalonians (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2, 6</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a></div><div class="verse">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proconsul</span> for <span class="accented">the deputy</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">with one accord rose</span> up for <span class="accented">made insurrection with one accord</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">before</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V. Gallio. Marcus Annaeus Novatus took the name of Lucius Junius Annaeus Gallio, on account of his adoption by L. Junius Gallio. He was the elder brother of Seneca, and a man of ability, and of a most amiable temper and disposition. His brother Seneca said that he had not a fault, and that everybody loved him. He was called "Dulcis Gallio" by Statius. It is unfortunately not known exactly in what year Gallio became either Consul or Proconsul of Achaia. Had it been known, it would have been invaluable for fixing the chronology of St. Paul's life. Lewin puts it (his proconsulate) in the year A.D. , and so does Renan; Howson, between A.D.  and A.D. . The circumstantial evidence from secular writers corroborating St. Luke's account is exceedingly curious. There is no account extant either of his consulate or of his proconsulate of Achaia. But Pithy, speaking of the medicinal effect of a sea-voyage on persons in consumption, gives as an example, "as I remember was the case with Annaeus Gallio after his consulate," and seems to imply that he went to Egypt for the sake of the long sea-voyage; which would suit very well his going there from his government in Achaia (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 31. cap. 6:33). And that his proconsulate was in Achaia is corroborated by a chance quotation in Seneca's Epistle 104, of a saying of "my lord Gallio, when ha had a fever <span class="accented">in Achaia</span> and immediately went on board ship," where the phrase "domini met," applied to his own brother, seems also to indicate his high rank. Profane history also shuts up the probable date of Gallio's proconsulate between the year A.D.  and the year A.D.  or 66, in which he died. There is a diversity of accounts as to his death. Ernesti, in his note on Tacitus, 'Auual.,' 15. 73, where Tacitus speaks of him as frightened at the death of his brother Seneca, and a suppliant for his own life, says, "quem Nero post interfecit," and refers to Dion Cassius, 58,18, and Eusebius. But Dion is there speaking of Junius Gallio in the reign of Tiberius, not of our Gallio at all; though afterwards, speaking of the death of Seneca, he says, "and his brothers also were killed after him "(62, 25). As for Eusebius, the passage quoted is not found in the Greek or Armenian copies of the 'Chronicon,' but only in the Latin of Jerome. But, as Scaliger points out, there is a manifest blunder here, because the 'Chronicon ' places the death of Gallio two years before that of Seneca, whereas we know from Tacitus that Gallio was alive after his brother's death. Moreover, the description "egregius declamator" clearly applies to Junius Gallio the rhetorician, and not to Gallio his adopted son. Though, therefore, Renan says, "Comme son frere il eut l'honneur sous Neron d'expier par, la mort sa distinction et son honnetete" ('St. Paul,' p. 222), if we give duo weight to the silence of Tacitus, it is very doubtful whether he died a violent death at all. St. Luke, as usual, is most accurate in calling him proconsul. Achaia had been recently made a senatorial province by Claudius.

It is used in the same sense in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11. 8:6). In a metaphorical sense it means" to renounce," "to bid adieu to" (<a href="../../par/luke/14-23.htm">Luke 14:23</a>). Of the six times it occurs in the New Testament, four are in St. Luke's writings and one in St. Paul's. <span class="cmt_word">With him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchreae</span>, etc. There is great diversity of opinion as to whether it was St. Paul or Aquila who had the vow. Meyer thinks that the mention of Priscilla before Aquila, contrary to the order in ver. 2 and in ver. 26 (where, however, the R.T. reads "<span class="accented">Priscilla</span> and <span class="accented">Aquila</span>), is a clear indication that Luke meant the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., to refer to Aquila, not to St. Paul, and Howson takes the same view. But this is a very weak argument, refuted at once by <a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, as well as by the whole run of the passage, in which Paul is throughout the person spoken of; or, as Alford puts it, in the consecutive narrative from ver. 18 to ver. 25, there are <span class="accented">nine</span> aorist participles, of which eight apply to Paul, as the subject of the section, making it scarcely doubtful that the ninth applies to him likewise. Moreover, there is no conceivable reason why the vow should be mentioned if it was taken by Aquila, and, what is still more conclusive, the person who went to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Paul, must be the one who had the vow, not the person who stayed behind, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Aquila. In fact, nobody would ever have thought of making Aquila the subject if it were not for the thought that there is an incongruity with Paul's character in his making a vow of that kind. But we must take what we find in Scripture, and not force it to speak our own thoughts. As regards the nature of the vow, it is not quite clear what it was. It was not the simple Nazaritic vow described in <a href="../../par/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18-21</a>; nor is the word here used by St. Luke (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) the one which is there and elsewhere employed by the LXX., and by St. Luke himself in <a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>, of that final shaving of the hair of the Nazarite for the purpose of offering it at the door of the tabernacle (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>). It seems rather to have been of the nature of that vow which Josephus speaks of as customary for persons in any affliction, viz. to make a vow that, for thirty days previous to that on which they intend to offer sacrifice, they will abstain from wine and will shave off (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) their hair, adding that Bernice was now at Jerusalem in order to perform such a vow ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 15:1). But it further appears, from certain passages in the Mishna, that, if any one had a Nazarite vow upon him outside the limits of the Holy Land, he could not fulfill such vow till he was come to the Holy Laud, to Jerusalem; but it was allowable in such case to cut his hair short (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and as some say to take it with him to Jerusalem, and there offer it at the same time that he offered his sacrifice and shaved his head (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). It would seem, therefore, that either in a severe illness or under some great danger (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>) St. Paul had made such a vow; that he had been unwilling to cut his hair short at Corinth, where he was thrown so much into the society of Greeks, and therefore did so at Cenchreae just before he embarked for Syria; and that he made all haste to reach Jerusalem in time for the Passover, that he might there accomplish his vow (see Bishop Wordsworth's note on Acts 18:18; and Farrar's ' Life of St. Paul,' 2. p. 2). His motives for the vow may have been partly those described on another occasion (<a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>), and partly his own Jewish feelings of piety showing themselves in the accustomed way. <span class="cmt_word">Cenchreae</span>.

As regards the expression, <span class="cmt_word">left them there</span>, it probably arises from some actual detail which made it the natural one to use. If, for example, the synagogue was just outside the city, and Paul, parting with Aquila and Priscilla in the city, had gone off immediately to the synagogue, the phrase used would be the natural one; or the words, "he left them there," may be spoken with reference to the main narrative, which is momentarily interrupted by the mention of St. Paul's visit to the synagogue. Note the extreme importance of this brief visit to Ephesus, where the foundation of a vigorous and flourishing Church seems to have been laid. He who knows "the times and the seasons" sent St. Paul there now, though two years before he had forbidden him to go to Asia.

According to Renan, Lewin, 'Speaker's Commentary,' and many others, it was at this time that the meeting with St. Peter occurred to which St. Paul refers in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, etc. And Renan ingeniously connects that perversion of the faith of the Galatians which led to St. Paul's Epistle being addressed to them, with the visit to Antioch of James's emissaries, Lewin also identifies the journey of St Paul to Jerusalem mentioned in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a> with that recorded in our ver. 22. But neither of these theories is borne out by any known facts, nor is in itself probable. There is no appearance of Barnabas or Titus being with St. Paul at this time, and it is very unlikely that any should have come from James to Antioch so immediately after St. Paul's salutation of the Church at Jerusalem and the fulfillment of his vow there. The time preceding the visit of Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, is far the most likely for the encounter of the two apostles (see <a href="../../par/acts/14-28.htm">Acts 14:28</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>, and note). <span class="cmt_word">Went through</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The region of Galatia and Phrygia</span>. In <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a> the order is inverted, "the region of Phrygia and Galatia," R.V., or "Phrygia and the region of Galatia," A.V. The natural inference from this is, as Lewin says, with whom Farrar agrees, that on this occasion St. Paul went straight from Antioch to Galatia, passing through the Cilician Gates and by Mazaca, or Caesarea, as it was called by Tiberius Caesar, in Cappadocia, and not visiting the Churches of Lycaonia. He proceeded from Galatia through Phrygia to Ephesus. The distance from Antioch to Tarsus was one hundred and forty-one miles, from whence to Tavium in Galatia was two hundred and seventy-one miles, making the whole distance from Antioch to Tavium in Galatia four hundred and twelve miles, or about a three weeks' journey including rest on the sabbath days. From Galatia to Ephesus would be between six hundred and seven hundred miles. The entire journey would thus be considerably more than a thousand miles, a journey of forty days exclusive of all stoppages. Six months probably must have elapsed between his departure from Antioch and his arrival at Ephesus; Lewin says "several months" (p. 330, note). <span class="cmt_word">In order</span>; in the same order, though inverted, in which he had first visited them, leaving out none. <span class="cmt_word">Stablishing</span>, etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); see above, <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32, 41</a>.

From ver. 24 to ver. 28 is a distinct episode, and an important one, as containing the first mention of a very remarkable man, Apollos (a short form of <span class="accented">Apollonius</span>, like Epaphras for <span class="accented">Epaphroditus</span>) of Alexandria, a city destined to play a conspicuous part in Church history, as the traditional Church and see of St. Mark, the school of the Neoplatonists, the scene of the labors of Origen, Clement, and many other men of note, and the birthplace of the Gnostic leaders Cerinthus, Basilides, and Valentinus. The notices of Apollos in the New Testament are <a href="../../par/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4, 5, 6, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; and all show St. Paul's high esteem for him. It was no more his fault than St. Peter's and St. Paul's that the factious Corinthians elevated him, or rather degraded him, into the leader of a party, Eloquent seems to be a better translation of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here than <span class="accented">learned.</span> The Greek word, which only occurs here in the New Testament, has both meanings.

It is difficult at first sight to conceive how at this time any one could know the baptism of John without knowing further that of Christ. But a possible account of it is that Apollos living at Alexandria, where as yet there was no Christian Church. had met some Jews who had been in Judaea at the time of John's ministry, and had heard from them of John's baptism and preaching, and of his testimony to Jesus as the Messiah, but had had no further opportunity of careful instruction in the faith of Jesus Christ till he happened to come to Ephesus and make the acquaintance of his compatriots, Aquila and Priscilla. They hearing him speak with fervor and eloquence, but perceiving that his knowledge was imperfect, immediately invited him to their house, and instructed him in the fullness of the truth of the gospel. This necessarily included the doctrine of Christian baptism, which we cannot doubt was administered to him (<a href="../../par/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>).

Nothing can be more natural than the course of events here described. In his intimate intercourse with Priscilla and Aquila, Apollos had necessarily heard much of the great work at Corinth, and the flourishing Church there; and so he longed to see for himself and to exercise his powers in watering what St. Paul had so well planted (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). Priscilla and Aquila having heard his eloquent sermons at Ephesus, and being interested in the Corinthian Church, seem to have encouraged him, and to have joined with the other disciples at Ephesus in giving him commendatory letters to the Church of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">Encouraged him</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, a word found nowhere else in the New Testament, but used in classical Greek and in the Apocrypha, in the sense of "exhorting," "urging." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> are hortatory words.

There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether the exhortation was addressed to Apollos, as the R.V. takes it, or to the brethren at Corinth, as the A.V. understands it. It seems rather more consonant to the structure of the sentence and to the probability of the case that the exhortation was addressed to the Corinthian Church, and not to Apollos, who needed no such encouragement, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is equivalent to "wrote and exhorted."

It is remarkable that the success of Apollos at Corinth seems to have been chiefly among the Jews, who had opposed themselves so vehemently to St. Paul (ver. 6). It is one of the many proofs of the singleness of eye and simplicity of purpose of the great apostle, that the success of this novice where he himself had failed did not excite the least jealousy (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>).
