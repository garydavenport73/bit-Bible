But as the scene is laid in the court of the temple, this is very improbable. Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20, 6:2) speaks of an officer apparently of the temple, who was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and was certainly a Jew by his name Ananus, and being, as Josephus relates farther ('Bell Jud.,' 2, 12:6), the son of the high priest Ananias. He also mentions the captain of the temple ('Bell. Jud.,' 6, 5:3) at the time of the destruction of the temple. There can be little doubt, therefore, that the captain of the temple here spoken of was a priest who had under him the Levitical guard, and whose duty it was to keep order in the temple courts in these turbulent times, lie appears from <a href="../../par/acts/5-25.htm">Acts 5:25, 26</a>, <a href="../../par/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4</a>, 52, and the passages in Josephus, to have been an officer of high rank.

The preaching the resurrection of the Lord Jesus as the "First fruits of them that slept," would be especially obnoxious to the Sadducees, "which deny that there is any resurrection" (<a href="../../par/luke/20-27.htm">Luke 20:27</a>). The Sadducees were at this time in power (see <a href="../../par/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6-8</a>); and we learn from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,'20. 9:1) that the son of this Annas (or Anauus) went over to the sect of the Sadducees, being himself high priest as his father had been.

The harsh persecution of the disciples at Jerusalem at this time when the Sadducees were in power is in exact accordance with Josephus's statement in the passage just referred to, that the Sadducees were more severe and cruel in their administration of justice than any other Jews. Their tenet of no life to come made them look to severe punishments in this life.

It is not clear whether the five thousand is exclusive of or includes the three thousand converts at the Feast of Pentecost; but the grammar rather favors, the former, as there is nothing in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, itself to signify "disciples," or "believers," and therefore it is more naturally referred to those of whom it had just been predicated that, having heard the Word, they believed it.

This clause is placed in the A.V. at the end of ver. 6 because, in the T.R., Annas, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander are in the accusative ease, whereas, in the R.T., they are in the nominative case; for which reason the R.V. supplies the words "was there" in ver. 6. We see here the different classes which composed the Sanhedrim.

He is called by Josephus, <span class="accented">Ananus.</span> The succession of the high priests was so irregular, and their tenure of the office so uncertain, in these later years of the Jewish commonwealth, being dependent upon the caprice of the civil rulers who appointed and deposed them at their pleasure, that it does not surprise us to find Annas and Caiaphas high priests at the commencement of John the Baptist's ministry, then Caiaphas at the time of our Lord's passion, and now Annas again. It is possible, however, that Annas may have continued to be president of the Sanhedrim, and be called high priest, even when not actually so. He seems to have lived to old age. He is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20, 60:1) as having had the singular felicity not only of enjoying the high priesthood himself for a great length of time, but of having five sons promoted to the dignity of high priest, viz. Eleazar, Jonathan, Theophilus, Mat-thins, and Ananus (or Annas). <span class="cmt_word">Caiaphas</span> (<a href="../../par/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>). Of <span class="cmt_word">John</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Alexander</span> nothing further is known, but Farrar conjectures that John may be "the celebrated Johanan Ben Zakkai, and Alexander perhaps the wealthy brother of Philo" ('Life of St. Paul,' 1. p. 107). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kindred of the high priest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the high priestly race.</span> The high priests were only taken from certain families; the members of which were called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, or chief priests, A.V. (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-47.htm">Matthew 26:47</a>, etc.), Many of these would naturally be the near relations of the high priest.

O Lord, etc. Either the margin or the A.V. is preferable to the R.V., which gives an unmeaning vocative pendent. The word here used for "Lord" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, from which our English word "despot" comes. It means "master, owner," in respect of slaves, and "a lord" or "king," whose power over his subjects is similar to that of a master over slaves. Here, with reference to creation and God's unlimited power overall that he has made, the Church in danger finds support and solace in the thought of God's absolute sovereignty. The term is applied to God in the New Testament elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29</a> (where observe its relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>, R.T.

In the LXX. it sometimes answers to <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and sometimes to <span class="accented">Adonai.</span> As regards the question how the whole assembly joined in this prayer, whether by a common inspiration, or by repeating the words after him that prayed them aloud (Alford), or by merely singing the second psalm (Baumgarten), or by all using what was already a formulary prepared for the needs of the Church (Meyer), it is difficult to speak positively, nor is it of any moment. Another possible explanation is that several members of the congregation, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, uttered brief prayers and praises, the consenting matter of which Luke thus puts together.

It was the fact that, while they preached the Word of God, the Lord confirmed the Word with <span class="accented">signs</span> following, which gave them such superhuman courage to persevere in the face of death and bonds.

The other ways of construing the sentence are either to make the clause, "that signs and wonders may be done," dependent upon "grant," which seems to be the meaning of the A.V., or else to take it, as Meyer does, as an independent clause, expressing the aim of the stretching out of the hand.

But it is also applied to the rocking caused by an earthquake (<a href="../../par/acts/16-26.htm">Acts 16:26</a>), which maybe the kind of shaking here meant. In this fresh outpouring or the Spirit, whereby they were enabled to <span class="cmt_word">speak the word of God with boldness</span>, they had a direct and immediate answer to their prayer (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>).

A significant token of the place occupied by the apostles (as later by the bishops of the Church) as the trustees and dispensers of the Church's funds as well as of the Church's doctrines. Compare "Ante pedes praetoris in fore expensum est auri pondo centum" (Cie. pp. Flacco, quoted by Alford). We have, too, here an instance of the way in which Church institutions rose gradually as occasion gave birth to them. So the institution of deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2, 3</a>), of presbyters or priests (<a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>), of bishops (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1.htm">1 Timothy 1-3</a>.), of Confirmation (<a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14-17</a>), appear to have come about in each case <span class="accented">pro re nata.</span>

The A.V. is less accurate, but it gives the sense better. Cyprus was the country where he was born and lived, as, it is likely, his fathers had done before him.
