This was the ancient capital of that division of Macedonia (Macedonia Prima); see <a href="../../par/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a>, note. It was situated on the Via Egnatia, thirty-four miles southwest from Philippi, and three miles from the AEgean Sea. It lay in a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Strymon, whence its name, <span class="accented">Amphipolis</span>; its modern name is <span class="accented">Neokhoria</span>, now a village. Its original name was <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1ffe;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, The Nine Ways. Originally a Thracian city, it was conquered by the Athenians, then by the Lacedaemonians, then fell under the dominion of Philip of Macedon, and finally, with the rest of Macedonia, became part of the Roman empire. <span class="cmt_word">Apollonia</span>; now probably <span class="accented">Polina</span>, thirty miles due west of Amphipolis, on the Via Egnatia. The modern track from Amphipolis to <span class="cmt_word">Thessalonica</span> does not pass through Polina, but beneath it. Thessalonica; on the Via Egnatia, now the important seaport of <span class="accented">Saloniki</span>, on the Aegean Sea or Archipelago, thirty-eight miles from Apollonia, and con-raining about sixty thousand inhabitants. Its ancient name was Therma (whence the Thermean Bay), but it took the name of Thessalonica under the Macedonian kings. It continued to grow in importance under the Romans, and was the most populous city of the whole of Macedonia. It was the capital of Macedonia Secunda under the division by AEmilius Paulus (<a href="../../par/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a>, note), and in the time of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia consisted of two provinces, it was the capital of Macedonia Prima. But from its situation and great commercial importance it was virtually the capital of "Greece, Macedonia, and Illyricum" (Howson, in ' Dict. of Geog.'). Its trade attracted a great colony of Jews from before the time of St. Paul, and through the Roman and Greek and Turkish empires, down to the present day, when "one-half of the population is said to be of Israelitish race "(Lewin). Thessalonica had a terrible celebrity from the massacre of its inhabitants by order of the Emperor Theodosius, in revenge for the murder of Botheric, his general, which led to the famous penance imposed upon the emperor by St. Ambrose (Gibbon,' Decline and Fall,' <a href="../../par/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>.). It was also taken three times in the Middle Ages: by the Saracens, with fearful slaughter, A.D. 904; by the Normans, with scarcely less cruelty, A.D. 1185; and by the Turks, in 1430. Its ecclesiastical history under its archbishops is also of great interest (see 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). <span class="cmt_word">Where was a synagogue</span>. It is needless to point out the exact agreement of this brief statement with historical fact as pointed out above. There is said to have been twenty-two Jewish synagogues at Thessalonica after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in the fifteenth century, and the number at the present time is stated to be thirty-six. The existence of a synagogue at this time was the reason of St. Paul's visit and sojourn there.

The fulfillment of prophecies relating to the Messiah in the person of Jesus is like the fitting of a key to the intricate wards of the lock, which proves that it is the right key. The preacher of the gospel should carefully study and expound to the people the word of prophecy, and then show its counterpart in the sufferings and glory of Christ. This did St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Opening</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); as our Lord had done (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>), the hidden meaning of the prophecies, and then <span class="cmt_word">alleging</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), setting before them the propositions which had thus been established.

He was a relation, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, of St. Paul's, and doubtless a Jew. <span class="accented">Jason</span> was a Romanized form of the name <span class="accented">Jesus</span>, or <span class="accented">Joshua, as</span> we see in the case of the high priest, the brother of Chins (Josephus, ' Ant.

This is a remarkable instance of St. Luke's accuracy. The word is unknown in Greek literature. But an inscription on an ancient marble arch, still standing in Thessalonica, or Saloniki, records that Thessalonica was governed by seven politarchs (see the inscription in Conybeare and Howson, col. 1. p. 360).

So Homer ('Odyssey,' 13:294) uses the word of transporting any one by ship to this or that town (quoted by Meyer). There is the indication in the word of St. Paul's defect of sight or infirmity. <span class="cmt_word">Receiving a commandment</span>, etc. We learn here that St. Paul sent a message to Silas and Timothy to join him at Athens as quickly as possible, and at ver. 16 that he waited at Athens for them. From <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2</a>, we learn that he sent Timothy from Athens back to Thessalonica; and from <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a> we learn that Timothy came to St. Paul at Corinth (where the Epistle to the Thessalonians was written) from Thessalonica. We also learn from <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a> that Silas and Timothy were both with him at Corinth when he wrote the Epistle, and from <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> that they had both come to Corinth from Macedonia, some weeks after Paul himself had been at Corinth (<a href="../../par/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4, 5</a>). All these statements harmonize perfectly (as Paley has shown) on the supposition that Silas and Timothy did join St. Paul at Athens; that for the reasons given in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3.htm">1 Thessalonians 3</a>, when he was unable to return to Thessalonica himself, as he much wished, he sent Timothy back to Thessalonica, and Silas probably to Beraea; and that Silas and Timothy came together from Macedonia to Corinth, where St. Paul had gone alone; where it may be noted, as another undesigned coincidence, that whereas the First Epistle to the Thessalonians implies that Silas did <span class="accented">not</span> go to Thessalonica (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy came from <span class="accented">Thessalonica</span>, but from <span class="accented">Macedonia.</span> The inaccuracy supposed by Meyer (on this verse) is purely imaginary. <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy "only joined Paul at Corinth," but merely relates some change in St. Paul's procedure consequent upon their joining him at Corinth. Alford (on this verse), in saying that Paul sent Timothy from Beraea, not from Athens, is guided by his own idea of what is probable, not by the letter of the narrative (see further note on Acts 18:5).

It is (says Lewin) a bare, rugged rock, approached at the south-eastern corner by steps, of which sixteen still remain perfect. Its area at the top measures sixty paces by twenty-four, within which a quadrangle, sixteen paces square, is excavated and leveled for the court. The judges seem to have sat on benches tier above tier on the rising rock on the north side of the quadrangle. There were also seats on the east and west sides, and on the south on either side of the stairs. The Areopagus (the upper court) was the most august of all the courts at Athens. Socrates was tried and condemned before it for impiety. On the present occasion, there is no appearance of judicial proceedings, but they seem to have adjourned to the Areopagus from the Agora, as to a convenient place for quiet discussion.

On the other hand, the Vulgate (<span class="accented">superstitiosiores</span>), the English Versions, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, etc., take the word in its most common classical sense of "superstitious;" and it weighs for something towards determining St. Luke's use of the word that Plutarch uses <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> always in a bad sense, of superstition, as in his life of Alexander and elsewhere, and in his tract 'De Superstitione' (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). Perhaps the conclusion is that St. Paul, having his spirit stirred by seeing the city full of idols, determined to attack that spirit in the Athenian people which led to so much idolatry; which he did in the speech which follows. But, acting with his usual wisdom, he used an inoffensive term at the outset of his speech.

There is no direct and explicit testimony in ancient writers to the existence of any one such altar at Athens, but Pausanias and others speak of altars to "unknown gods," as to be seen in Athens, which may well be understood of several such altars, each dedicated to an unknown god. One of these was seen by St. Paul, and, with inimitable tact, made the text of his sermon. He was not preaching a foreign god to them, but making known to them one whom they had already included in their devotions without knowing him.

St. Paul applies it, too, to the circumcision made with the knife, as distinguished from that wrought by the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a>). It is frequent in the LXX. It is a striking instance of St. Paul's unflinching boldness and fidelity to the truth, that he should expose the hollowness of heathen worship, standing within a stone's throw of the Parthenon and the temple of Theseus and the countless other temples of gods and goddesses, which were the pride and glory of the Athenian people. Note how he begins his catechetical instruction to the Athenians with the first article of the Creed: "I believe in God the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth."

It may be remarked by the way that the languages of the earth, differing like the skins and the features of the different races, and corresponding to those various bounds assigned by God to their habitations, yet bear distinct and emphatic testimony to this unity.

The teaching, therefore, of the passage is that, though God was very near to every man, and had not left himself without abundant witness in his manifold gifts, yet, through the blindness of the heathen, they had to feel their way uncertainly toward God. In this fact lies the need of a revelation, as it follows ver. 30, etc. And hence part at least of the significance of such passages as, "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>); "Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a> ); "God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>), and many more like passages.

The earliest notice we have of him in ecclesiastical writers is the well-known one of Eusebius, 'Eccl.

Eusebius repeats the statement in his long notice of Dionysius of Corinth, in 4. 23. Other uncertain traditions speak of him (Suidas) as one who rose to the height of Greek erudition, and as having suffered a cruel martyrdom (Niceph., 3:11). "The works which go by his name are undoubtedly spurious" (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Damaris</span>; "wholly unknown" (Meyer), but certainly not the wife of Dionysius, as Chrysostom (' De Sacerd.,' 4:7) and others have thought ('Dictionary of the Bible'). <span class="cmt_word">And others with them</span>. These would seem to be but few from St. Luke's way of mentioning them, and from our hearing nothing more in the Acts about the Church at Athens. It is remarkable that this small number of converts coincides with the weakness of the synagogue at Athens - too weak to persecute, and too weak to make proselytes among the Greeks of Athens. It scorns clear that nowhere else had St. Paul won so few souls to Christ. And yet God's Word did not return to him wholly void.
