Peter and John. The close friendship of these two apostles is remarkable. The origin of it appears to have been their partnership in the fishing-boats in which they pursued their trade as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. For St. Luke tells us that the sons of Zebedee were "partners with Simon," and helped him to take the miraculous draught of fishes (<a href="../../par/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). We find the two sons of Zebedee associated with Peter in the inner circle of the Lord's apostles, at the Transfiguration, at the raising of Jairus's daughter, and at the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (see also <a href="../../par/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>). But the yet closer friendship of Peter and John first appears in their going together to the palace of Caiaphas on the night of the betrayal (<a href="../../par/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15</a>), and then in the memorable visit to the holy sepulcher on the morning of the Resurrection (<a href="../../par/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2-4</a>), and yet again in <a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20, 21</a>. It is in strict and natural sequence to these indications in the Gospel that, on opening the first chapters of the Acts, we find Peter and John constantly acting together in the very van of the Christian army (see <a href="../../par/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1, 3, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hour of prayer</span>; called in <a href="../../par/luke/1-10.htm">Luke 1:10</a>, "the hour of incense," that is, the hour of the evening sacrifice, when the people stood outside in prayer, while the priest within offered the sacrifice and burnt the incense (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, note). Hence the comparison in <a href="../../par/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set before thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- That was lame</span> for <span class="accented">lame</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">door</span> for <span class="accented">gate</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Door</span>.

Perhaps the lame man leant against one of the open doors. <span class="cmt_word">Which is called Beautiful</span>. It is not certain what gate this was. In the 'Dictionary of the Bible' it is described as "the great eastern gate leading from the court of the women to the upper court," following apparently Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5. 5:3. But it is impossible to reconcile Josephus's two accounts - that in the 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. and that in 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 11. In the former he says distinctly that there were ten gates - four on the north, four on the south, and two on the east. In the latter he says there were three gates on the north, three on the south, and one on the east. In the former he says that fifteen steps led up <span class="accented">from</span> the women's enclosure to the great gate, exactly opposite the gate of the temple itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); in the latter he says very distinctly that women were allowed to enter through the great gate on the east. With such discrepancies in the description of the only eye-witness whose evidence has been preserved, it is impossible to speak with certainly. But it seems probable that there were two gates on the east - one the beautiful and costly gate of Corinthian brass, elaborately described by Josephus, through which the women did pass; the other the greater gate, just opposite to and above the beautiful gate (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), leading from the court of the women to the inner court; and that Josephus has confounded one with the other in his descriptions. Anyhow, the beautiful gate was probably on the east. Its correct name is said to be the gate of Nicanor. <span class="cmt_word">The temple</span>. It must be remembered that the whole platform, including the porches, and the courts of the Gentiles and of the women, and the outer court and the court of the priests, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; the actual house was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; that part of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> to which only Israelites were admitted, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Josephus also divides the precincts into the first, second, and third <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The description of this lame man laid at the gate of the temple to ask alms is very similar to that in <a href="../../par/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> of Lazarus laid at the rich man's gate; only that the word for <span class="accented">laid</span> is in St. Luke <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>.

Barabbas was a murderer, one who took away human life for his own base ends; the other was the Prince and Author of life, who was come into the world, not to destroy men's lives, but to save them. This title, taken in connection with the preceding declaration, "God hath glorified his Servant Jesus," seems almost to be a reminiscence of our Savior's prayer," Father,...  glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him" (<a href="../../par/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1, 2</a>). Jesus himself in very many places dwells upon his own great prerogative of giving life: "I am come that they might have life, and.., have it more abundantly" (<a href="../../par/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>); "I am that Bread of life;" "I am the living Bread ... if any man cat of this bread, he shall live for ever;" "I give... my flesh for the life of the world;" "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life;" "They that hear shall live;" "As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;" "The Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should...  have eternal life;" "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> applied to Christ is found also in <a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>, and in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, rendered the "<span class="accented">Author</span> or <span class="accented">Captain</span> of their salvation," "of our faith." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof we are witnesses</span> (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, note). The marginal rendering <span class="accented">of</span> whom is equally literal, and may be defended by reference to <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-31.htm">Acts 13:31</a>; but the rendering <span class="accented">whereof</span> is in accordance with the more frequent phrases (<a href="../../par/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>, etc.). The meaning is practically the same. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/3-16.htm">Acts 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- By faith in his Name hath this</span> for <span class="accented">his Name through faith in his Name</span>, A.V.: the order of the words is changed from that of the A.V., to bring it into accordance with the order of the Greek, but with a great loss of force in English; <span class="accented">behold</span> for <span class="accented">see</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the faith</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the faith.</span> The two propositions are not the same.

Some (see Alford, 1:1) compare <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>, and make God the object of the faith of his witnesses, Peter and John. Others (Meyer) understand that the faith in the Name of Christ was wrought in Peter and John by or through Christ's ministry and resurrection. But it is much more consonant with other passages (<a href="../../par/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-28.htm">Matthew 15:28</a>, etc.) to understand the faith to be that of the man who was healed; and then the phrase, "which is through him," will denote naturally that it was through Jesus Christ that the man's faith brought him into contact, so to speak, with God who healed him. In the same spirit we read that the lame man "praised God" (vers. 8, 9) for the cure effected through the Name of Jesus Christ; and Peter says (ver. 15), "Whom God raised from the <span class="accented">dead."</span> The interpretation of the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> depends upon whether we supply an active or a passive word. The faith which <span class="accented">acts</span>, or <span class="accented">works</span>, or <span class="accented">moves</span> through him is one way of understanding it; the faith which <span class="accented">is wrought</span> or <span class="accented">produced</span> through him is the other. The first is preferable. <span class="cmt_word">This perfect soundness</span>; pointing to what they saw with their own eyes while the man was leaping and dancing before them (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, perfect soundness, used only here in the New Testament; it is a medical term).

What Peter conceives is that if Israel turns to God at once in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, then there will come at once those times of refreshing, those blessed days of righteousness, and peace, and rest, and universal joy, which are the characteristics of Christ's kingdom as foretold by the prophets. Those days are delayed by the unbelief of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Seasons of refreshing</span>. The A.V." times of refreshing" is manifestly right, though there is no article in the Greek. "Seasons of refreshing" seems very vague and vapid (see Alford, 1:1, who very appropriately and conclusively cites the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "the times of the Gentiles"(<a href="../../par/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>).

If so, the time of restoration is not exactly synchronous with the times of refreshing, but preparatory to them; preparatory, too, to that restoration of the kingdom to Israel of which the apostles spake to the Lord (<a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). Probably, however, St. Peter includes in his view the immediately following times of" the presence of the Lord," just as in St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>) the preparatory mission of John the Baptist is included in the phrase, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof God spake</span>.

That this was understood by the Jews to relate to some one great prophet who had not yet come, appears from the question "Art thou that prophet?" (<a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>), and from the saying of the Jews after the miracle of the loaves and fishes, "This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world" (<a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>). St. Peter here teaches that that prophet was none other than Christ himself, who was like unto Moses in the fullness of the revelation given unto him, in his being a Mediator between God and the people, in being the Author of a new law - the law of faith and love, in building a new tabernacle for God to inhabit, even the Church in which he will dwell for ever and ever (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>).
