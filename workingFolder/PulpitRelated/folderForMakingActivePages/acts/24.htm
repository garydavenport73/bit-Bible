The groan flattery of this address of the hired orator, placed at the beginning of his speech, in order to win the favor of the judge, is brought into full light by comparing Tacitus's account of the misconduct of Felix in Samaria in the reign of Claudius, who he says, thought he might commit any crime with impunity, and by his proceedings nearly caused a civil war ('Annah,' 12:54); and his character of him as a ruler of boundless cruelty and profligacy, using the power of a king with the temper of a slave ('Hist' 5. 9.); and Josephus s statement that no sooner was Felix recalled from his government than the chief men among the Jews at Caesarea went up to Rome to accuse him before Nero, when he narrowly escaped punishment through the influence of his brother Pallas. <span class="cmt_word">By thy providence</span>.

St. Paul uses it four times in his Epistles for "rest" or "ease" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-13.htm">2 Corinthians 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>). Doubtless St. Luke was thus enabled to be much with St. Paul during his imprison merit, and, as suggested above, to have his help in writing his Gospel.

It implies that Felix had been absent from Caesarea for some days after the trial. <span class="cmt_word">Drusilla</span>. She was, according to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 7:1, 2) the daughter of Herod Agrippa I., who "killed James with the sword" (<a href="../../par/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 2</a>), and died shortly afterwards. She was first the wife of Azizus, King of Emesa; but Felix, becoming enamored of her on account of her singular beauty, employed a certain magician, a Jew named Simon, to entice her away from her husband, and persuade her to marry him, contrary, as Josephus says, to the institutions of her country. She perished, with Agrippa, her only son by Felix, in the eruption of Vesuvius, in the reign of Titus (Josephus, as above). Tacitus says that Drusilla, the wife of Felix, was granddaughter of Antony and Cleopatra. But he seems to have confounded her with another of the three royal wives of Felix, mentioned by Suetonius in 'Claudius;' unless, perchance, as has been conjectured, be had two wives of the name of Drusilla, of whom one was, as Tacitus says, granddaughter of Antony, by being the daughter of King Juba and Cleopatra Selene, Antony's daughter (see note in Whiston's 'Josephus,' and in Kuinoel, on <a href="../../par/acts/23-24.htm">Acts 23:24</a>). But there is no certainty on the subject. Only Josephus's detailed account of Drusilla, the wife of Felix, agrees with St. Luke's statement that she "was a Jewess," and is beyond doubt true.

The mixture of conviction with covetousness in the mind of Felix as the motive for seeing Paul is observable. As in other cases of double-mindedness, the convictions were doubtless stifled by the corrupt avarice, and so came to nothing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a></div><div class="verse">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> <span class="accented">- When two years were fulfilled</span> for <span class="accented">after two years</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus</span> for <span class="accented">Porcius Festus came into Felix</span> <span class="accented">room</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">desiring to gain</span> favor <span class="accented">with the Jews</span> for <span class="accented">willing to show the Jews a pleasure</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in bonds</span> for <span class="accented">bound</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Felix</span> is also transposed. <span class="cmt_word">Was succeeded by</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. This word occurs only here in the New Testament, but is used twice in Ecclesiasticus. It is also, as above noted, the identical word used by Josephus of Festus. But in <a href="../../par/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a> Festus's government is called an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:11) calls Festus an <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of the more usual <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Could Josephus have seen the Acts of the Apostles? <span class="cmt_word">Porcius Fetus</span>. Josephus speaks of him as sent by Nero to be the "successor" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of Felix ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2. 14:1). Nothing is known of him from Tacitus or other Latin historians, and he appears from Josephus's account to have held the government for a very short time, probably less than two years, when he died ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 9:1). But the impression derived from Josephus is the same as that conveyed by St. Luke, that he was a just and upright ruler, in marked contrast with Felix his predecessor, and his successors Albinus and Gessius Florus. <span class="cmt_word">Desiring to gain favor</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to lay up in store good will</span>, or favor, or <span class="accented">a boon</span>, to be requited at some future period. A frequent phrase in the best classical authors. Felix had good reason thus to try and put the Jews under obligation to him at the close of his government. For the danger was great to the retiring governor of complaints being sent to the emperor of oppression and plunder, which were often listened to and punished. Josephus relates, in point of fact, that the chief Jews in Caesarea sent an embassy to Rome to lodge a charge against Felix before Nero; and that he only escaped punishment by the influence of his brother Pallas ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9). The scene in this chapter is a very striking one, depicted with admirable simplicity and force. The bloated slave sitting on the seat of judgment and power, representing all the worst vices of Roman degeneracy. The beads of the sinking Jewish commonwealth, blinded by bigotry and nearly mad with hatred, forgetting for the moment their abhorrence of their Roman masters, in their yet deeper detestation of the Apostle Paul. The hired advocate with his fulsome flattery, his rounded periods, and his false charges. And then the great apostle, the noble confessor, the finished Christian gentleman, the pure-minded, upright, and fearless man, pleading his own cause with consummate force and dignity, and overawing his heathen judge by the majesty of his character. It is a graphic description of s very noble scene. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
