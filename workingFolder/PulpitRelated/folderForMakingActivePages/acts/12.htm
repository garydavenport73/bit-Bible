The phrase, About that time, as in <a href="../../par/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23</a>, points to what had just before been related (Meyer). The interposition of the narrative in this chapter between <a href="../../par/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a> and Acts 12:25 evidently implies that the bulk or rather the chief of the events narrated happened in the interval. Which of the events was the chief in the mind of the narrator with reference to his general narrative, and what are the coincidences which he wished to note, it is not easy to say with certainty. The narrative in this chapter doubtless overlaps at both ends the embassy of Paul and Barnabas, but perhaps the object was to show the harassed state of the Church from famine and persecution at the time that Paul and Barnabas were at Jerusalem. Herod the king here mentioned is Herod Agrippa I., grandson of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus and Bernice. During the reign of Tiberius he resided at Rome, in alternate favor and disgrace, sometimes banished, sometimes a prisoner, sometimes a guest at the imperial court. He was a great friend of Caius Caesar Caligula, and, on his succeeding to the empire on the death of Tiberius, was promoted by him to the tetrarchy of Herod Philip, with the title of king. He was further advanced three years afterwards to the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas; and, on the accession of Claudius to the throne, Judaea and Samaria were added to his dominions, which now comprised the whole kingdom of his grandfather, Herod the Great. Agrippa, in spite of his close intimacy with Drusus, Caligula, Claudius, and other Roman magnates, was "exactly careful in the observance of the laws of his country, not allowing a day to pass without its appointed sacrifice;" and he had given proof of his strong Jewish feeling by interposing his whole influence with Caligula to prevent his statue being placed in the holy of holies. This spirit accounts for his enmity against the Church. He was a man of very expensive and luxurious habits, but not without some great qualities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">James</span>, the son of Zebedee, or <span class="cmt_word">James the Elder</span>, to whom, with his brother John, our Lord gave the surname of Boanerges (which is a corruption of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>), sons of thunder. Nothing is recorded of him in the Acts but his presence in the upper room at Jerusalem after the Ascension (<a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), and this his martyrdom, which was the fulfillment of our Lord's prediction in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-23.htm">Matthew 20:23</a>. His being singled out by Herod for death in company with Peter is rather an indication of his zeal and activity in the Lord's service, though we know nothing of his work. Eusebius relates an anecdote of his martyrdom, extracted from the lost work of Clement of Alexandria, called the <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (or in Latin <span class="accented">Adumbrationes</span>), which Clement professed to have received by tradition from his predecessors, to the effect that the informer who accused James was so struck with his constancy in confessing Christ before the judge, that he came forward and confessed himself a Christian too. The two were then led off to execution together; and on the way the informer asked James's forgiveness. After a moment's hesitation, James said to him, "Peace be unto thee," and kissed him. They were then both beheaded ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2. 9.). As Clement flourished about A.D. , the tradition need not have passed through more than three persons. It has been thought strange that Luke relates the death of a chief apostle with such brevity. But it did not bear on the main object of his work. Lightfoot ('Works,' vol. 8. p. 282, etc.) mentions a fanciful story related by Rabauus Maurus, that about this time the apostles composed the Apostles' Creed, each contributing one clause, and that the clause contributed by James the brother of John was, "And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord."

We have another characteristic trait of the religion of Agrippa, and of his sympathy with the feelings of the Jews about the Law, that he would not allow a trial on a capital charge, or an execution, to take place during the Feast of Unleavened Bread (comp. <a href="../../par/john/18-8.htm">John 18:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bring him forth to the people</span>.

It is the action of one having something to say and bespeaking silence while he says it. <span class="cmt_word">Unto James</span>. This, of course, is the same James as is mentioned in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a> as "the Lord's brother," and who, in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 12</a>, and <a href="../../par/acts/15-12.htm">Acts 15:12</a> and Acts 21:18, as well as here, appears as occupying a peculiar place in the Church at Jerusalem, viz. as all antiquity testifies, as Bishop of Jerusalem. So Hegesippus, quoted by Eusebius ('Eccl. <span class="accented">Hist.</span>,' <span class="accented">2:</span>23), "James the Lord's brother, called by universal consent the Just, received the government of the Church together with the apostles;" and in <a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a> he quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that, after the Ascension, Peter, James, and John selected James the Just, the Lord's brother, to be the first Bishop of Jerusalem. And Eusebius gives it as the general testimony of antiquity that James the Just, the Lord's brother, was the first who sat on the episcopal throne of Jerusalem. But who he was exactly is a point much controverted. The three hypotheses are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he was the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary, sister to the blessed Virgin, and therefore our Lord's cousin german, and called his brother by a common Hebrew idiom. According to this theory he was one of the twelve (<a href="../../par/luke/6-15.htm">Luke 6:15</a>), as he appears to be in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, though this is not certain (see Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he was the son of Joseph by his first wife, and so stepbrother to the Lord, which is Eusebius's explanation ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he was in the full sense the Lord's brother, being the son of Joseph and Mary. This is the opinion of Alford (<span class="accented">in lee.</span>), fully argued in the 'Proleg. to the Epistle of James,' and of Meyer, Credner, and many German commentators. According to these two last hypotheses, he was not one of the twelve. "The apostolic constitutions distinguish between James the son of Alphaeus, the apostle, and James the brother of the Lord, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Meyer). It may be added that <a href="../../par/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> separates the brethren of the Lord from the apostles, who are enumerated in the preceding verses. The hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with James the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary is well argued in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "James" (see also the able Introduction to the Epistle of James in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). It seems impossible to come to a certain conclusion. The weakest point in the hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with the son of Alphaeus is that it fails to account for the distinction clearly made between the Lord's brothers and the apostles in such passages as <a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46, 49</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>. For the effect of these passages is scarcely neutralized by <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>. But then, on the other hand, the hypothesis that the Lord's brethren, including James and Joses, were the children of Joseph and Mary, seems to be flatly contradicted by the mention of Mary the wife of Clopas as being "the mother of James and Jests" (<a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He went to another place</span>. Whether Luke was not informed what the place was, or whether there was some reason why he did not mention it, we cannot tell. The Venerable Bode ('Prolog. in Expos. in Act. Apost.'), Baronius, and other authorities of the Church of Rome, say he went to Rome, and commenced his episcopate of Rome at this time Dr Lightfoot thinks it more probable that he went to Antioch (Comm. on Acts, in vol. 8. pp. 273, 289). Some guess Caesarea; but there is no clue really.

The blood of the martyr James was the seed of the Church, and the speedy vengeance taken by God upon the persecuter doubtless gave fresh courage to his people to confess the Name of Jesus Christ. As regards the preceding account of Herod Agrippa's death, it is corroborated in the most remarkable manner by the narrative in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 19. 8:2). He there tells that when he had been three years King of all Judaea (see ver. 1, note) he went to Caesarea. And that on occasion of a festival celebrated "for the safety of Caesar" (some think to celebrate his return from Britain, while others, as Wieseler, think that they were the ordinary Quinquennalia, celebrated in the provinces), he exhibited games and spectacles in honor of Claudius. On the second day of these games, when a vast number of people were assembled in the theatre, Agrippa can? m, clothed in a garment wholly made of silver, which reflected the rays of the morning sun with a most dazzling and awful brilliancy. Whereupon his flatterers cried out that he was a god, and offered prayer to him. The king, he adds, did not rebuke them nor reject their impious flattery, he was presently seized with a violent pain in his bowels, which soon became so intense that he was carried out of the theatre to his palace, and expired after five days of excruciating pain. It is curious that in the above account Josephus says that Agrippa saw an owl sitting over his head, which he recognized as a messenger (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of evil to him. Eusebius, quoting Josephus Eccl. Hist.,' 2. 10.), leaves out the owl, and says that Agrippa saw an angel sitting over his head, whom he recognized as the cause of his sufferings. Whiston, in a note, seeks to exonerate Eusebius from unfairness in the quotation by suggesting that the manuscript of Eusebius is in this place corrupt; but Bede quotes Josephus just as Eusebius does, unless perchance he is quoting him at second hand from Eusebius. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a></div><div class="verse">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled <i>their</i> ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="accented">Ministration</span> for <span class="accented">ministry</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">talking</span> for <span class="accented">and took</span>, A.V. The fact here stated of their taking John Mark with them, is very interesting in connection with ver. 12. Whether or no Saul and Barnabas were in the house of Mary at the time of Peter's deliverance from prison, they evidently went there shortly before or shortly after. As regards the sequence of events related in this chapter, it is by no means necessary to suppose that Barnabas and Saul did not leave Jerusalem till after the death of Agrippa. Luke, connecting the death of Agrippa with his murder of James and his intended murder of Peter, as Eusebius and Chrysostom and others rightly say, would naturally follow up the narrative of the persecution by the narrative of the persecutor's awful death; and then go on to relate the return of the two apostles to Antioch in continuation of <a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>. We have no means of deciding whether, in point of fact, they returned before or after Agrippa's death. It seems most probable that they returned before, as, under the circumstances, they would not tarry at Jerusalem longer than was necessary for the fulfillment of their ministration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
