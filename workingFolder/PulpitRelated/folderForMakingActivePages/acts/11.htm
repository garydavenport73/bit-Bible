But the explanation of it is to be found in the circumstance of St. Luke himself being a Gentile; perhaps also, as Alford suggests, in his use of language suited to the time when he wrote. It is an indication, too, of the purpose of St. Luke in writing his history, viz. to chronicle the progress of Gentile Christianity. Peter, having completed his rounds (<a href="../../par/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32</a>), returned to Jerusalem, which was still the abode of the apostles. He was, no doubt, anxious to commune with his brother apostles upon the momentous matter of the Gentile converts; but he was at once attacked by the bigotry of the zealous Jews.

We are all familiar with the "Punic Wars," <span class="accented">Punica fides</span>, the 'Paenulus' of Plautus, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Cyprus</span> lies off the coast of Phoenicia, in sight of it, and was very early colonized by the Phoenicians.

It lay about one hundred and eighty miles north of the northern frontier of Phoenicia. There was a large population of Jews, whom Seleucus attracted to his new city by giving them equal political privileges with the Greeks. It was reckoned by Josephus to be the third city in importance of the whole Roman empire, Rome and Alexandria being the two first. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a></div><div class="verse">And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">But there were some of them...</span> who for <span class="accented">and some of them were.., which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Greeks also</span> for <span class="accented">the Grecians</span>, A.V. and T.R.

It is supported, however, by strong authority of manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, and is accepted by Grotius, Witsius, Griesbach, Lachman, Tischendorf, Meyer, Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Westcott, Bishop Lightfoot, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' (apparently) and most modern critics. It is also strongly argued that the internal evidence proves <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> to be the right reading, because the statement that the men of Cyprus and Cyrene preached the gospel to them is contrasted with the action of the others, who preached to the Jews only. Obviously, therefore, these Hellenes were not Jews. Moreover, there was nothing novel in the conversion and admission into the Church of Hellenistic Jews (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>, etc.; Acts 9:22, 29). And these very preachers were in all probability Hellenists themselves. Bishop Wordsworth, however, on the contrary, defends, though with doubt, the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; and argues that even if <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is the right reading, it must mean the same as <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. He also hints that it might mean "proselytes" (see <a href="../../par/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>, where the Hellenes attend the synagogue, and <a href="../../par/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>). But there is no evidence that these were proselytes any more than Cornelius was. The Hellenes, or Greeks, here were probably uncircumcised Greeks who feared God, like Cornelius, and attended the synagogue worship (see Meyer on <a href="../../par/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>). It is very likely that in Antioch, where the Jews occupied such a prominent position, some of the Greek inhabitants should be attracted by their doctrines and worship, repelled, perhaps, by the prevalent superstitions and profligate levity of the great city.

The news of this accession of Gentiles to the Church was quickly carried to Jerusalem, with the same motive, probably, that brought thither the account of the baptism of Cornelius and his household, as we read in vers. 1-3 of this chapter. The conduct of the Church in sending so excellent and temperate a person. as Barnabas (as we read in the next verse), the friend of Saul (<a href="../../par/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>) and a favorer of preaching the gospel to Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1, 2</a>) to inspect the work at Antioch, is an indication that they had already heard the account of the conversion of Cornelius from the mouth of Peter, and were already led to the conclusion, "Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life!" There is no clue whatever to the length of time that elapsed between the flight from persecution and the arrival at Antioch, except that Saul had had time to sojourn three years in Arabia, to come to Jerusalem, and from thence to go and settle at Tarsus, where Barnabas found him; thus leaving abundant time for Peter's operations in Judaea and Caesarea.

It is pleasing to read this testimony from Luke, Paul's companion and friend, <span class="cmt_word">Full of the Holy Ghost and of faith</span>. So Stephen is described (<a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>) as "full of faith and of the Holy Spirit." The Holy Spirit is spoken of in both places as a Spirit of power and demonstration in preaching the Word. No reason is apparent why the R.T., having altered <span class="accented">Ghost</span> to <span class="accented">Spirit</span> in <a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>, retains <span class="accented">Ghost</span> here. <span class="cmt_word">Much people</span>, etc.; the direct consequence of the energy of the Holy Ghost in Barnabas's ministry.

Observe the remarkable providence which had made use of the violence of the Hellenist Jews at Jerusalem to drive Saul to Tarsus, where he would be close at hand to take up the work so unexpectedly prepared for him at Antioch. "It was in the spring of the year A.D. , or just ten years after the Crucifixion, that Barnabas proceeded to Tarsus, found Saul, and brought him to Antioch" (Lewin, 1:96). From Seleucia to the port of Tarsus would be about a twelve hours' sail; or, by land, a journey of about eighty miles would bring him to Tarsus from Antioch.

It is a peculiar use of the word occurring in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a> besides, but found also in Polybius, Strabo, Josephus, and some other writers. Its common meaning is, in the passive voice, "to be warned of God," as in <a href="../../par/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">Christians</span>. It was a memorable event in the history of the Church when the name of <span class="accented">Christians</span>, which has distinguished them for nearly eighteen centuries and a half, was given to the disciples of Christ. Hitherto they had been called among themselves disciples, and brethren, and saints, and, by the Jews, men "of the Way" (<a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>), or "Nazarenes" (<a href="../../par/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>), but now they received the name of <span class="accented">Christians, as</span> followers of Christ, from the outside world, and accepted it themselves (<a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). From the Latin form of the word <span class="accented">Christians, i.e.</span> followers of Christ (like Herodians, followers of Herod; Marians, Pompeians, partisans of Marius and Pompey; Caesariani, Ciceroniani, Vitelliani, Flaviani, etc.; Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:130; Lewin, vol. 1:97), the designation most have been invented by the Gentiles, either by the Roman court or camp at Antioch, or by the Greek population, influenced as they were by Roman forms of speech current amongst them (compare the Greece-Oriental Nestorians, Arians, etc.). We may be sure that <span class="accented">Christians, i.e.</span> followers of Messiah, is not a name likely to have been given by Jews. There is no evidence either of its having been given in derision. The well-known account of Tacitus is "Vulgus Christianos appella-bat. Auctor nominis ejus Christus, Tiberio imperitante, per Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat" ('Annal.,' 15:44). Suidas says that those who had been previously called <span class="accented">Nazarenes</span> and <span class="accented">Galileans</span>, in the reign of Claudius Caesar, when Euodius had been made Bishop of Antioch by Peter, had their name changed into that of <span class="accented">Christians.</span> He seems to refer to the statement of Malalas (quoted by Conybeare and Howson, 1:131), that they who had been before called Nazarenes and Galileans received the name of <span class="accented">Christians</span> in the time of Euodius, who succeeded St. Peter as Bishop of Antioch, and who himself gave them this name." Malalas is thought to have lived somewhere between the sixth and ninth centuries, at Byzantium. A beautiful passage in the Clementine Liturgy is also quoted at p. 130: "We give thee thanks that we are called by the Name of thy Christ, and are thus reckoned as thine own," where the allusion is to <a href="../../par/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>. The name <span class="accented">Christian</span> is frequent in the epistles of Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch; Polycarp's dying words were, "I am a Christian" (Bishop Wordsworth).

In point of fact, the predicted famine, which began in the fourth year of Claudius Caesar (A.D. 44) and lasted till A.D. , fell upon Judea exclusively, as far as appears from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' lit. 15:3; 20. 2:5, 5:2), and was very severe there. Ishmael was high priest at the time; and Helena, Queen of Adiahene, fetched large supplies of corn from Egypt and of figs from Cyprus to Jerusalem, to supply the wants of the people. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8) speaks of this famine as having prevailed "over the world," and as being recorded by authors hostile to Christianity, but mentions no names and gives no particulars ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8), but in the twelfth chapter of the same book he limits it to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Judaea. There were several other historical famines in the reign of Claudius, but they can hardly be included in the prophecy of Agabus. The prophet Agabus is mentioned again in <a href="../../par/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10</a>, and again as coming from Judaea. Renan ascribes the poverty-stricken condition of the Jerusalem Christians to their communistic institutions.

This is the first mention of presbyters, or elders, in the Church at Jerusalem, which was now fully organized. James the Less was the resident apostle (?) and bishop; with him were the presbyters (<a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>); and under them again the seven deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5, 6</a>). The presbyters of the Church of Jerusalem are mentioned again in <a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13</a>, where, however, the elders of other Churches in Judaea may possibly be included. A difficulty arises with regard to Saul's mission to Jerusalem with Barnabas, as to how to reconcile it with <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, which speaks of St. Paul's second visit to Jerusalem as taking place fourteen years after his first, whereas this visit could not be above four or <span class="accented">five</span> years after. But there are three hypotheses about the visit to Jerusalem referred to in <a href="../../par/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The first identifies it with the visit here recorded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The second identifies it with that related in <a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>, etc., which is supported by most of the best authorities ancient and modern (see note on Acts 15.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The third, which is advocated by Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1:302, etc.), identifies it with the visit recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>. As regards the first, with which we are now concerned, though at first sight you would have ex-peered St. Paul's next visit to Jerusalem after his conversion to be the one alluded to in Galatians it., yet the following circumstances make this impossible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The date of the visit named in Galatians it, which is distinctly stated to be <span class="accented">fourteen</span> years after that recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When St. Paul went to Jerusalem on the occasion adverted to in Galatians it.," he laid before them the gospel which he preached among the Gentiles." But at the time of this visit he had not yet begun his labors among the Gentiles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>), to which he was only called after his return (<a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> On the occasion spoken of in Galatians it, Paul and Barnabas were received by the chief apostles, and must have passed a considerable time at Jerusalem, with many consultations and meetings, public and private. But on this occasion, as far as appears, their visit was a very hasty one, and they saw no one but the presbyters, and returned as soon as they had handed over the collection to them (<a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>). The conclusion, therefore, seems quite certain that this is not the visit referred to in Galatians it. And the hasty nature of this visit explains at once why St. Paul made no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. It had no bearing upon the course of his argument. It was not a visit to Jerusalem in the sense in which he was speaking, and he saw none of the apostles. The state of the Church at the time, James the son of Zebedee killed, Peter in prison or lately escaped "to another place" (<a href="../../par/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>), the other apostles very likely dispersed, made it impossible. He therefore took no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. This seems quite a sufficient explanation (see the note of Bishop Ellicott on <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, and Bishop Lightfoot's convincing remarks at p. 113 of his 'Epistle to the Galatians'). There is no occasion to resort to the violent expedient of Renan, and say that Saul did not go with Barnabas at this time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
