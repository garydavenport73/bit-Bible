The <span class="accented">teachers</span> would appear to differ from the prophets in that they were not under the ecstatic influence of the Holy Spirit, and did not utter exhortations or prophecies in a poetic strain, but were expounders of Christian truth, under the teaching of the Spirit. What they spoke was called a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>), and their function was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as <a href="../../par/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is reckoned among the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, the gifts of the Holy Ghost.

It is thought by Meyer, Alford, and others that the position of the particles <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> attaching the two following names to Barnabas in the first place, and one name following to Manaen in the second, indicates that Barnabas, Symeon, and Lucius were prophets, and Manaen and Saul teachers. Lucius has by some been falsely identified with St. Luke. The foster-brother; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may equally mean a foster-brother, one nursed at the same time at the same breast, which would indicate that Manaen's mother was wet-nurse to Herod the tetrarch; or a playmate, which would indicate that he had been <span class="accented">sodalis</span> to Herod. It is only found here in the New Testament, but is used by Xenophon, Plutarch, etc., and in 1 Macc. 1:7; 2 Macc. 9:29. In this chapter and onwards the scene of the great drama of Christianity is transferred from Jerusalem to Antioch. The first part, which has hitherto been played by Peter and John and James, is now taken up by Barnabas and Saul, soon, however, to be classed as Paul and Barnabas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- And as</span> for <span class="accented">as</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They ministered</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not, as Meyer explains it, the whole Church, but the prophets and teachers, doubtless at an assembly of the Church. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, here rendered "they ministered" (from which the word "Liturgy" is derived), signifies any solemn ministration or holy service. In the Old Testament the LXX. use it as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, to minister (often with the addition "to God," or "to the Lord "), which is a general word applying to the ministrations of priests and Levites (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-26.htm">Numbers 8:26</a>, etc.). Hence its use in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a> (see too <a href="../../par/luke/1-23.htm">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>). Joshua too is called Moses'minister (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>) in <a href="../../par/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>, etc., and the angels are called <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "ministering spirits" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Just as the Church transferred from the Jewish congregation so many other words and things, so also the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, to Sicily "Divine service," without specifying the particular office, whether prayer, or preaching, or Holy Communion, or ordination, or any ether part of the worship of God. Its classical use was to designate any office performed by an individual for the public good. Hence in the New Testament its application to Church alms (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>), to gifts for the support of the ministry (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>), to the office of magistrates (<a href="../../par/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>), etc. The restricted application of the term <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to the service used in the celebration of the Eucharist was of much later growth, as is evident from Chrysostom explaining the word here of preaching. "What means ministering? Preaching" (Hom. 27.). It seems to have arisen from the fact that the first forms of prayer were those come posed for the office of the Holy Communion. This passage, therefore, does not give the slightest support to fasting Communion. What was the exact occasion of the service and fast here spoken of it is impossible to say. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy Ghost said</span>, etc. This is the origin of the question in the Ordination of Deacons, "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office?" <span class="cmt_word">Separate me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The act of separation, or ordination, would be by the laying on of the hands of Symeon and Lucius and Manaen, as Chrysostom says (at least of the two last named), in the presence of the whole Church, but the separation by the Holy Ghost, at least as regards Saul (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>), bad been from his mother's womb (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>). Observe, too, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>, and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here. This is another instance of the very close resemblance between parts of the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians, which looks as if St. Paul was writing it about the same time as he was giving to St. Luke the details of his own history (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-19.htm">Acts 8:19</a>, note). The ordination was to the apostolate (Chrysostom). Barnabas and Saul are never called apostles till after their ordination or consecration (<a href="../../par/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid <i>their</i> hands on them, they sent <i>them</i> away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- Then</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V. It does not follow that the laying on of hands was on the same day. On the contrary, the mention of the fasting again in this verse makes it impossible so to understand it. Doubtless, on receiving this intimation of the Spirit, they fixed a day for the ordination, and prepared for it by fasting and prayer. The ember days of the Church before ordinations are m accordance with this precedent of Holy Scripture. With this departure of Barnabas and Saul commences the second and main part of the Acts of the apostles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Went down to</span> for <span class="accented">departed unto</span>, A.V. (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Seleucia was the sea-port of Antioch, about sixteen miles from it, and five miles north of the mouth of the Orontes. It was a free city by a grant from Pompey. It is now in ruins, but "the masonry of the once magnificent port of Seleucia is in so good a state that" it might be repaired and cleared out "for about &pound;31,000" (Colonel Chesney, quoted in Lewin, 1. p. 119). They sailed to Cyprus. Barnabas, no doubt, took the lead, and was naturally drawn to his native island of Cyprus - within a hundred miles of Seleucia, and, on a clear day, visible from it. The number of Jews in the island, and the partial evangelization of it which had already taken place (<a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19, 20</a>), and which promised them assistance and support, no doubt further influenced them. John Mark went with them, as we learn from the fifth and thirteenth verses, and possibly other brethren as deacons and ministers (see next note). They sailed straight to Salamis, "a convenient and capacious <span class="accented">harbor</span>," in the center of the eastern end of the island, and the principal or one of the principal towns. It had a large population of Jews. It was destroyed in the reign of Trajan, in consequence of a terrible insurrection of the Jews, in which they massacred 240,000 of the Gentile population. No Jew was ever after allowed to land in Cyprus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to <i>their</i> minister.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Proclaimed</span> for <span class="accented">preached</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as their attendant</span> for <span class="accented">to their minister</span>, A.V.

It is a word taken from the synagogue, where it denotes an inferior minister (see <a href="../../par/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a>). In <a href="../../par/acts/5-22.htm">Acts 5:22</a> the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are the apparitors of the high priest. Here it is synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a deacon. John was to Barnabas and Saul what Joshua was to Moses, Elisha to Elijah, etc. Peter, when he went to Caesarea, was accompanied by six brethren (<a href="../../par/acts/11-12.htm">Acts 11:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name <i>was</i> Barjesus:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The <span class="accented">whole island</span> for <span class="accented">the isle</span>, A.V. and T.R.

But here, as in <a href="../../par/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>, it has a bad sense. It is a Persian word, and in its original use designated a Persian religious caste, famous for their knowledge, wisdom, and purity of religious faith. They were attached to the court of the Babylonian monarchs, and were deemed to have great skill in astrology, in interpretation of dreams, and the like (see <a href="../../par/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-7.htm">Daniel 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a> in the LXX.). In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3, 13</a>, the name <span class="accented">Rab-mag</span> seems to mean "the chief of the magi." But in process of time the word "magus" came to mean a sorcerer, a magician, a practicer of dark arts, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Simon Magus (see the chapter on magic in Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,'lib. 30. cap. 1.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-7.htm">Acts 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- The proconsul</span> for <span class="accented">the deputy of</span> the <span class="accented">country</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of understanding</span> for <span class="accented">a prudent man</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the same</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto him</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sought</span> for <span class="accented">desired</span>, A.V.

Cyprus had become a proconsular province in the reign of Claudius, having previously been one of the emperor's provinces governed by a propraetor, or legatus. A man of understanding (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is a rare word in the New Testament, and is always translated in the A.V. "prudent" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>). It is common in the LXX., where it represents the Hebrew words <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, all signifying "intelligence," "skill," "knowledge," and the like. The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> has the same scope (see <a href="../../par/luke/2-47.htm">Luke 2:47</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>, etc.); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, therefore, means something more than "<span class="accented">a</span> prudent man." It means a man of knowledge and superior intelligence and understanding. And such was Sergius Paulus, a noble Roman, who is twice named by Pliny in the list of authors placed at the commencement of his work as the authorities from whom he derived the matter contained in the several books. It is not a little remarkable that the two books, lib. it. and lib. 18, for which Sergius Paulus is quoted are just those which contain accounts of the heavenly bodies, and prognostications from the sun and moon and stars, from thunder, from the clouds, and such like things, which doubtless formed the staple of Elymas's science; so that there can be little doubt that Sergius Paulus had Elymas with him, that he might learn from him such matters as might be useful for the hook which he was writing. There is also a curious passage in lib. 30. cap. 1. of the 'Hist. Nat.'(quoted by Lewin, vol. 1. p. 128), in which Pliny, after enumerating the most famous teachers of magic, Zoroaster, Orthanes, Pythagoras, and others, adds, "There is also another school of magic which springs from Moses and Jannes, who were Jews, but many thousand years later than Zoroaster; so much more recent is the school of Cyprus;" showing that he knew of a school of magic art at Cyprus taught by Jews, and leading us to infer that he had acquired this knowledge either from the pen or the mouth of Sergius Paulus. Anyhow, a remarkable confirmation of St. Luke's narrative. Another Sergius Paulus, who might be a son or grandson of the proconsul, is highly commended by Galen for his eminent philosophical attainments (Lewin, vol. 1. p. 127). One L. Sergius Paulus was consul suffectus in A.D. , another in A.D. . Renan thinks they may have been descendants of the Sergius Paulus in the text.

The explanation of Jerome, Augustine, Bede, and many modern commentators, as Meyer, Olshausen, etc., and not rejected by Renan, is that Saul took the name of Paul on the occasion of this remarkable and important conversion of Sergius Paulus. Saul's future intercourse with Gentiles made it desirable that, after the common custom of the Jews of his day - as seen in Peter, Stephen, Mark, Lucius, Jason, Crispus, Justus, Niger, Aquila, Priscilla, Drusilla etc. - he should have a Gentile name, and so, in honor of his illustrious convert, or in memory of his conversion, or at the special request of Sergius Paulus (Baronius), he took the name of Paul, which in sound was not unlike his Hebrew name. The fact of this change of name being recorded by St. Luke at this precise moment makes this the most simple and natural explanation. Compare Gideon's change of name to Jerubbaal (<a href="../../par/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-29.htm">Judges 8:29, 35</a>). Alford, on the ether hand, thinks it strange that any one should make such a mistake as Jerome's, and says that "this notice marks the transition from the former part of his history" - "gathered from the narratives of others" - to "the joint memoirs of himself and St. Paul." But this gives no account of the coincidence of the two Pauls, nor is it true that the latter half of the Acts begins here. It began at ver. 1, and the name of Saul has been retained three times in the early part of this chapter. Farrar speaks of this explanation as, long and deservedly abandoned," and as having in it an element of vulgarity. Howson thinks that <span class="accented">Paul</span> had long been his Roman name, but that the conversion of Sergius Paulus, as it were, stereotyped the Roman name as that by which the apostle was henceforth to be known. The idea of Augustine and others, that he took the name of Paul (<span class="accented">paulus</span>, small) from humility, to indicate that he was "the least" of the apostles, is fanciful. Neither is Chrysostom's assertion, that he changed his name at his ordination or consecration, borne out by the facts. Renan ('Saint Paul,' 1:19) notes that "Paul" was a very common name in Cilicia. No certainty can be arrived at in the matter.

As regards the reason why the particular punishment of blindness was inflicted upon Elymas, it might be to put a forcible interruption upon those observations of the stars and clouds by which the magician pretended to foresee the future.

A very marked change may here be observed in the relations of Barnabas and Paul. Hitherto Barnabas has always occupied the first rank. It has been "Barnabas and Saul" (<a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>; vers. 2, 7).

Renan dwells much on the beauty of Barnabas's character as seen in his cheerful acquiescence in this change of relative position, and his single-minded devotion to the success of the work. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Perga</span>, the capital of Pamphylia, in that part of the coast of Asia Minor which looks due south. Perga was about seven and a half miles inland, on the river Cestrus, which is navigable. There was a constant intercourse between Paphos the capital of Cyprus, and Perga the capital of Pamphylia, fostered probably by the two famous temples of Venus and Diana. The word for set sail (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a nautical term, meaning sailing from the shore or harbor into the open sea (see <a href="../../par/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-1.htm">Acts 21:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a>). At Perga John Mark left them. Perhaps his position as Barnabas's cousin was less pleasant now that Paul took the first place; perhaps his courage failed him now that they were fairly launched out into the heathen world, where, unlike Cyprus, his Jewish kinsmen were a small minority, and the dangers and fatigues were great. Pamphylia was now governed by a propraetor, being an imperial province. Its name denotes that it was inhabited by a mixed race - men of all tribes, aborigines, Cilicians, Greeks, etc.

The natural conclusion is that that speech made a deep impression upon St. Paul when he heard it at Stephen's trial. The common purpose in the two speeches is to conciliate and gain the attention of the Jewish hearers by dwelling upon the great events of the history of their fathers, of which they were proud, and claiming for Christians an equal heritage in that history. The speeches diverge in that Stephen sought to show in that history instances of the same stubborn unbelief in their fathers which had led the children to crucify the Lord of glory; but St. Paul rather sought to show how the promises made to their fathers had their fulfillment in that Jesus whom he preached unto them, and how the crucifixion of Christ by the Jerusalem Jews was an exact fulfillment of the Law and the prophets which had just been read to them in the synagogue. In both speeches it is a great point to exhibit Christianity as the true development of Judaism (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a> and throughout).

It is difficult to say what is the meaning of the R.T. in regard to the four hundred and fifty years, what is the terminus a <span class="accented">quo</span> or <span class="accented">ad quem</span> intended by it. The usual explanations of the reading of the R.T. (adopted by Lachman, Bishop Wordsworth, and others) is that the years are dated from the birth of Isaac, and that the meaning is that the promise to give the land to the seed of Abraham was actually performed within four hundred and fifty years (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) (after the analogy of <a href="../../par/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>), which gives a good sense and is not at all improbable (see Bishop Wordsworth's note). The reading of the T.R. has grave objections on the score of chronology as well as grammar. Duration of time is expressed by the accusative case, as vers. 18 and 21; the measure of time in which a thing is done by the dative. So that the natural rendering of the T.R. would be that he gave them judges four hundred and fifty years after the entrance into Canaan; which of course cannot be the meaning. The other objection is that, if the times of the judges from the final conquest of the land to the judgeship of Samuel was four hundred and fifty years, the whole time from the Exodus to the building of the temple must have been about six hundred and forty years (37 from death of Moses to Othuiel + 450, + 30 for judgeship of Samuel, + 40 of Saul's reign, + 40 for David's reign, +3 years of Solomon, + and the 40 years in the wilderness), whereas <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> gives the time as four hundred and eighty years; while the genealogies suppose a much shorter time - about two hundred and eighty years. It is an immense gain, therefore, to get rid of this four hundred and fifty years for the time of the judges, and by the well-supported reading of the R.T. to get a calculation in agreement with <a href="../../par/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a> and with the chronology of the times. <span class="cmt_word">Gave them... for an inheritance</span>.

And in consequence of their rejection, you, who had no share in crucifying the Lord of glory, are invited to take their place. But it maybe taken as expressing the cause why this salvation is complete and capable of being offered to them. This salvation is preached to you because, through the instrumentality of those that dwell at Jerusalem, all that was written in the Scriptures concerning Christ has been fulfilled.

Who are meant? and what ascent from Galilee to Jerusalem is here intended? The answer to the first question is, the eleven apostles, whose special office it was to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (<a href="../../par/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>, note). The answer to the second is, that the ascent from Galilee, where most of our Lord's appearances took place, to Jerusalem, shortly before the Ascension, is here intended, and that this passage is a distinct recognition by St. Luke of the Galilaean appearances. There is, as is well known, great obscurity, and apparent discrepancies in the accounts of our Lord's appearances after the Resurrection. St. Matthew seems to place them exclusively in Galilee (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7, 10, 16</a>). St. Mark likewise (16: 7); but in the section 9-20 he mentions the appearance to Mary Magdalene and to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, but gives no clue as to where the appearance to the eleven took place. St. Luke seems to place them exclusively in Judaea, but very curiously puts a mention of Galilee in the angel's mouth in the very place where, according to St. Matthew, he announced the Lord's appearance in Galilee. St. John, again places the three first appearances in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/john/20.htm">John 20</a>.), but describes at length a third as having taken place in Galilee (<a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2, 14</a>). St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>) speaks of an appearance to five hundred brethren at once, which in all probability took place in Galilee, as only a hundred and twenty names were numbered at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>). It is, therefore, satisfactory to have this confirmation of the residence of the apostles in Galilee between the Resurrection and the Ascension in St. Luke's report of St. Paul's speech. Observe that St. Paul distinctly separates himself from these witnesses by the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 32.

There can be no reasonable doubt that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, raised up, means here, as in ver. 44, raised from the dead. Observe with what skill the apostle speaks of the resurrection of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise to their fathers, which it was to be presumed they were anxiously expecting. The second psalm. Many manuscripts and editions have, "the first," because the first psalm was often reckoned not numerically but as an introduction to the whole book, so that the second psalm was numbered as the first. This is probably the reason why the eighteen psalms as reckoned by the Jews include <a href="../../par/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, though Joshua ben Levi explains it by the rejection of the second psalm, on account, no doubt, of its testimony to Messiah as God's begotten Son. But the rabbins generally acknowledge the application of this psalm to Messiah (Lightfoot, 'Exercit. on the Acts'). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my Son</span>, etc. This application of the second psalm to the Resurrection is best explained by <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>. The reference in both passages to David is remarkable (vers. 22, 23). Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all worlds, was declared before men and angels to be the Son of God, when he was raised from the dead in the power of an endless life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34</a></div><div class="verse">And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, <i>now</i> no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- Hath spoken</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">holy and sure blessings</span> for <span class="accented">sure mercies</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>No more to return to corruption</span>. This is added to show that Christ's resurrection was a final victory over death; not like that of Lazarus, or the Shunammite's son, or Jairus's daughter, but, as St. Paul himself says (<a href="../../par/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him." Here he tells us that this eternal exemption of Christ from death was promised or signified in <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>, which he quotes from the LXX., only abbreviating the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., into <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, I will give.

And in like manner, in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;</span> means "the mercies of God to David." And if we turn to the account of this covenanted mercy in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, we shall see that it comprises the setting of David's seed upon his throne for ever (see specially vers. 12-16). In ver. 15 it is said, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "My mercy shall not depart from him." And in the next verse his house and his kingdom are described as being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sure," or "established for ever," which, when applied to the personal Christ, the Son of David, manifestly implies his eternal exemption from death and corruption (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>). The sense of the Hebrew, therefore, is clever and certain, and it is equally certain that the LXX. meant to represent this sense in the version here quoted by St. Paul. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though properly meaning "holy, pious," and thence "mild" and "merciful" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, Hesych.) as applied to man, came to be applied in the same senses to God (<a href="../../par/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>; and here and in the LXX.). Beyond doubt, therefore, the passage before us is rightly rendered in the A.V., "the sure mercies of David;" the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, represents the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the Hebrew. Clemens Alex.

In a similar way, the Latin <span class="accented">pietas</span> is used for God's "justice" or "kindness" ('AEneid,' 2:536; 5:688). "Trini pulses pietatem" (on a sepulchral monument, A.D. 1427): "Beat at the door of God's mercy." Gronovius, in his note on 'AEian. V.

St. Paul took the LXX. as he found it. Perhaps he saw signs in some of that unbelief and perverse opposition which afterwards broke out (ver. 45), and so was led to close his sermon with words of awful warning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-42.htm">Acts 13:42</a></div><div class="verse">And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - And <span class="accented">as they went out</span> for when <span class="accented">the Jews were gone out of the synagogue</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">they</span> for <span class="accented">the Gentiles</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">spoken</span> for <span class="accented">preached</span>, A.V. They besought. The R.T. is that of Chrysostom and the best manuscripts, and is adopted by Meyer, Olshausen, Lange, Afford, Bishop Wordsworth, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc. There is a difference of opinion as to who is meant by <span class="accented">they.</span> The simplest explanation is that <span class="accented">they</span> means Paul and Barnabas, who went out of the synagogue before the formal dismissal of the congregation; and, as they were going out, received an invitation to repeat their instruction on the next sabbath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-43.htm">Acts 13:43</a></div><div class="verse">Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - The <span class="accented">synagogue broke up</span> for <span class="accented">the congregation was broken up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the devout</span> for <span class="accented">religious</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">urged</span> for persuaded, A.V. This verse manifestly describes something subsequent to the event recorded in the preceding. The congregation had asked Paul and Barnabas, perhaps through the ruler of the synagogue, to return next sabbath. But when the congregation broke up, many Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas to their own house and received further instructions and exhortation to continue in the grace of God. No doubt Barnabas had his full share in this more private ministry of exhortation (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>, note, and Acts 11:23). (For the meaning of "to continue in the grace of God," see <a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>.)

(where see note), is nearer the sense; though jealousy of the influence of the two strangers may have entered into the fierce passion which was stirred up in the Jewish mind, as well as jealousy for their own religion, which they saw was being superseded by the doctrine of Paul.

It is in accordance with this purpose of God that St. Paul says of the gospel that "it is the power of God unto salvation...  to the Jew first, and also to the Greek" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Compare, too, our Lord's saying (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>) and the woman's reply (ibid. 27). In point of fact, this had been the practice of Paul and Barnabas no less than of Peter, and was the very motive that had brought them to Antioch. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles</span>. These were, indeed, bold words to speak in a Jewish synagogue; the speakers had doubtless sought courage from the Holy Ghost (see <a href="../../par/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>).

Iconium is assigned by Xenophon to Phrygia; by others to Pisidia; and again by others (Cicero, Strabo, etc.) to Lyeaonia. At this time it was the capital of a separate tetrarchy (Lewin, 'Saint Paul'), but Renan calls it" the capital of Lycaonia" ('Saint Paul,' p. 41).

In spite of the persecution, in spite of the danger, in spite of the banishment of their teachers, the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-34.htm">Hebrews 10:34</a>). With regard to this important incident at Antioch, Renan observes on its powerful influence in turning St. Paul's mind more decisively to the conversion of the Gentiles as the great object of his apostleship. He adds, "The character of that great soul was to have a boundless power of expansion. I know none to be compared with it in respect of its inexhaustible freshness, its unlimited resources of will, and readiness to make the most of every opportunity, except that of Alexander the Great? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
