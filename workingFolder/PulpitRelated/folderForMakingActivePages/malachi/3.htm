Are they ready to meet him and to bear his sentence? Who this "messenger" is is disputed. That no angel or heavenly visitant is meant is clear from historical considerations, as no such event took place immediately before the Lord came to his temple. Nor can Malachi himself be intended, as his message was delivered nearly four, hundred years before Messiah came. The announcement is doubtless founded upon <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, and refers to the same person as the older prophet mentions, who is generally allowed to be John the Baptist, the herald of Christ's advent (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-10.htm">Matthew 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prepare the way before me.</span> The expression is borrowed from Isaiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span> (comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>).

The Divinity of Messiah is thus unequivocally asserted. In him are fulfilled all the promises made under the old covenant, and he is called (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>) "the Mediator of the new covenant." Some render," and the Messenger," etc., thus distinguishing the Angel of the covenant from the forerunner who prepares the way.

Probably the ashes of some plant yielding a lye, like carbonate of soda, are meant. Such plants are met with on the shores of the Mediterranean and Dead Seas, and at this day large quantities of alkalies are extracted from them and exported in different directions (see Tristram, 'Nat.

The prophet confines himself to the first of the two images presented in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Levi.</span> Especially the priests, who ought to set an example, and teach holiness and obedience. Thus judgment should begin at the house of God (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). The purifying consists not only in exterminating the evil, but also in correcting and improving all who are not wholly incorrigible. We may call to mind Christ's purging of the temple, and his denunciations of the teaching body among the Jews, and see herein his way of trying his ministers in all ages, that they may shine like lights in the world, and adorn the doctrine of God in all things. <span class="cmt_word">That they may offer</span> (<span class="accented">and they shall be offering</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto the Lord an offering</span> (<span class="accented">minchah</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in righteousness.</span> The pure sacrifice shall then be offered with a pure heart.

As in the days of Moses, David, and Solomon, or still earlier in the case of Abel, noah, Abraham, and the patriarchs. (See the account of the ideal priesthood, ch. 2:5, etc.) The prophet does not necessarily expect that the Mosaic ritual is to last forever and to be maintained  throughout the world, but he employs the terms with which the Jewish people were conversant to express the worship of the new covenant (comp. <a href="../../par/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>, and note there).

He tells them that his judgment shall extend beyond the Levites even unto all the people; they will then see whether, as they supposed, the evil went unpunished. The announcement applies especially to the circumstances of Malachi's time, though, of course, it has an extended reference. <span class="cmt_word">Swift witness.</span> God's judgments fall swiftly and unexpectedly; and when they fall the sinner is at once convicted, and no con-comment, excuse, or subterfuge is possible.

This is to show that God performs his promises, and effectually disposes of the allegation in <a href="../../par/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>, that he put no difference between the evil and the good. The great principles of right and wrong never alter; they are as everlasting as he who gave them. God here speaks of himself by his covenant name, which expresses his eternal independent being, "the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</span> Because God's eternal purpose stands good, and his "gifts and calling are without repentance" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>), therefore the Israelites are indeed chastised and corrected, but not wholly consumed; they have a place and a nation, and the great promises made to their foregathers will all be fulfilled in due time (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-20.htm">Micah 7:20</a>). He calls them "sons of Jacob," to remind them of the covenant made with their great ancestor, which was the portion of all true Israelites (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20, 21</a>). Orelli would read, "Ye have not made an end," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of your sins; so virtually the Septuagint, which joins this clause to the following verse. But the present text is most probably correct.

Return: unto me, and I will return unto you (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>, where see note). Man must cooperate with God's preventing grace, and then God gives him further grace unto repentance and amendment. Here, if the people followed the preaching of the prophets and obeyed the promptings of the Holy Spirit, God promises to bless and save them. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein shall we return?</span> Here is the Pharisaical spirit, as in <a href="../../par/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>, etc. They do not acknowledge their offence; they consider that they are righteous and need no repentance.

The Latin and Greek Versions have, "He is vain who serveth God." <span class="cmt_word">Have kept his ordinance</span> (<span class="accented">charge</span>). Have done what he ordered. They are either wilfully deceiving themselves and others by pretending an obedience which they never really paid; or they think that the outward observance of certain legal requirements is all that is required. Some think that an interval of time separates this from the last section, and that meanwhile they had made some efforts at improvement, expecting, how. ever, immediate results in added blessings; and as these did not come as quickly as they hoped, they relapsed into their old distrust. <span class="cmt_word">Have walked mournfully</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in mourning apparel, as if fasting and mourning for sin (<a href="../../par/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>).

They attributed a certain virtue to voluntary fasts, without any consideration of the spirit in which they were observed (see the reproof of such formal observances in <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4</a>, etc.).

We, they say, do not reckon the humble and meek blessed; we consider that the only blessed ones are the arrogant heathen, or free thinkers, who meet with prosperity and happiness in this world. For the "proud," the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "strangers," which, doubtless, gives the meaning (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are set up;</span> literally, <span class="accented">are built up</span> - have wealth and families, and leave a name behind them (<a href="../../par/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>; see in the original, <a href="../../par/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>, where the phrase, "being built," includes all temporal prosperity). <span class="cmt_word">They that tempt God are even delivered;</span> <span class="accented">they tempt God, and are delivered</span> (ver. 10). They try and provoke God by their impiety, and yet escape punishment.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard <i>it</i>, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - With these impious murmurers the prophet contrasts those who fear God, as above (<a href="../../par/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5-7</a>) he set the picture of the true priest in opposition to his delineation of the evil ministers. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. When the impious made the above infidel remarks, the pious spake often, conversed together. What they said is not repeated, but it was language well pleasing unto God, who deigned to listen to their words, and to console them by announcing the future destiny of the good and the evil. They may have argued with these impious talkers, and warned others against them; or they may have expostulated as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>, but yet with  full faith that what God does is always good; and this sentiment was all the harder to cherish because they lived under a system of temporal rewards and punishments. The Septuagint and Syriac have, "These things spake they that feared the Lord," as if the two preceding verses reported the words of the pious. Some Fathers and commentators have taken the same view. But it is difficult to conceive such words coming from the mouth of those who fear God; unless they are so called ironically. But this is inadmissible, as we see that in the present verse they are represented in their true character, and such a sudden change from irony to actuality is unnatural and quite opposed to the prophet's usual manner. <span class="cmt_word">A book of remembrance was written before him.</span> The hook represents God's providence and omniscience, his ever-wakeful care, his unfailing knowledge. "Are not these things noted in thy book?" says the psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>); and when the dead were judged, Daniel saw that the books were opened (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). The idea is taken from the national records wherein were noted events of importance, such as we find in the cuneiform inscriptions (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-15.htm">Ezra 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). This book was to lie, as it were, always before the eyes of the Lord, to remind him of the pious.

This day of the Lord is the day of judgment, which God is always preparing by his visitation of nations and individuals. Then shall the righteous be to God a peculiar treasure (<span class="accented">segullah</span>), that which he prizes as his special possession (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, whence the expression is derived; and comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>: 14:2; 26:18; <a href="../../par/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will spare them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when I punish sinners.
