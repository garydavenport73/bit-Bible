Or, more generally, all farming labours shall succeed and prosper. Jerome's paraphrase is, "There shall be universal peace and joy;" Septuagint," But I will show forth peace." Another way of understanding the words which has found much favour with modern commentators is to take the clause in apposition with the words immediately following; thus: "The seed (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> growth) of peace, the vine, shall give its fruit." But there is no especial reason why the vine should be called "the seed of peace." It is not peculiar among fruit trees for requiring a time of peace for its cultivation. And the term "seed" is very inappropriate to the vine, which was not raised from seed, but from cuttings and layers. Perowne also points out that such a rendering destroys the balance of the three following clauses, which explain and expand the general statement that agriculture shall prosper. Dr. Alexander takes "the seed of peace" to be that from which peace springs; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that peace should be radically established in the land, and from this fact the results following should ensue. This affords a very good sense; but it is probably a metaphor quite unintended by the prophet.

Jerome gives the later Jewish traditions concerning them. The fast of the seventh day of the fourth month commemorated the breaking of the two tables of the commandments by Moses, as well as the first breach in the walls of Jerusalem; that of the fifth month was observed in memory of the return of the spies sent to explore Canaan, and the consequent punishment of forty years' wandering in the wilderness, as well as of the burning of the temple by the Chaldeans; that in the tenth month was appointed because it was then that Ezekiel and the captive Jews received intelligence of the complete destruction of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Joy and gladness.</span> The observance of these fasts seems, by the Lord's answer, to have been neither enjoined nor forbidden; but as for their sins their festivals had been turned into mourning (<a href="../../par/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>), so now their fasts should be turned into joyful feasts, and former miseries should be forgotten in the presence of the blessings now showered upon them. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore love the truth and peace.</span> This is the condition of the fulfilment of the promise (ver. 16; <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>), here again forcibly impressed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/8-20.htm">Zechariah 8:20</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; <i>It shall</i> yet <i>come to pass</i>, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people;</span> <span class="accented">peoples.</span> The sight of the prosperity of the Jews shall induce surrounding nations to join in the worship of Jehovah. The same truth is expressed in <a href="../../par/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1-3</a>. Perowne thinks that vers. 20, 21 refer to the tribes of Israel; but it seems unnatural to suppose the prophet asserting that it will yet happen that Israelites will seek the Lord, when there is no reason to think that they had not done so in some fashion, or that they would need the previous deliberation mentioned in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Many cities.</span> So the LXX. and Vulgate. Others translate, "great, or, populous cities;" but this is less suitable.

The Gentiles would be moved, not only to make pilgrimages to the great annual festivals, but to seek to know the Lord, and how to worship him acceptably. <span class="cmt_word">I will go also.</span> The inhabitants answer willingly to those who exhort them. It is quite unnatural to take the clause to mean (as Drake does), "I, Zechariah, will go too, to see the alteration in the mode of observing these fast days." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/8-22.htm">Zechariah 8:22</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many people</span> (<span class="accented">peoples</span>) <span class="cmt_word">and strong nations</span>. This explains ver. 20 more fully. The Jews were not actuated by the missionary spirit, yet even before Christ's advent their religion had spread into all parts of the world, as we see from the catalogue of proselytes in <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9-11</a>. Intimations of the same fact are given in <a href="../../par/ezra/6-21.htm">Ezra 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to keep the solemn festivals observed there (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-20.htm">Isaiah 66:20-23</a> <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>, and note there). The literal fulfilment of this prophecy is not to be looked for. It declares the future conversion of the Gentiles, and their being made one with Israel in the Church of Christ, "one fold under one Shepherd" (<a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>).

St. Cyril considers the idea to be that the heathen shall cling to the Jews like children holding their fathers' dress for support and guidance. In "the man that is a Jew" St. Jerome discerns the Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">We will go with you.</span> The picture presented to the mind by this verse is of a Jew journeying to Jerusalem from some distant country to keep a solemn festival, and a number of Gentiles clinging round him, asking permission to accompany him on his journey, because they have learned how good the Lord has been to his countrymen. But the ideal intended is much more than this. Salvation, indeed, is of the Jews; it began to be announced at Jerusalem; it was preached by the Jewish apostles; its founder was of the seed of David. But the true Israelites are not merely those who are of the natural posterity of Abraham, but all true Christians united under Christ, the Head. To their number all who would be saved must be joined (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
