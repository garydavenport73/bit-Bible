The mention of teraphim in this passage is thought to indicate a date anterior to the Captivity; but the prophet is speaking of past events, of the results of these base superstitions in former, not present, time. Three kinds of superstition are mentioned. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "speaking" images.

The Vulgate seems to be correct, "dreams, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dreamers, spake deceit." This is the third class among the practisers of superstitious observances. They comfort in vain, when they promise temporal blessings (<a href="../../par/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they went their way as a flock.</span> Because they trusted in these vain superstitions, the Israelites had to leave their own place, were led into exile like a flock of sheep driven away for sale or slaughter (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They were troubled.</span> They were and are still oppressed by the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Because there was</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="cmt_word">no shepherd.</span> Because they had no king to guard and lead them, they fell under the power of foreign rulers, who ill treated and oppressed them (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>).

Some commentators raise "the shepherds" to be the rulers of Israel civil and ecclesiastical, comparing <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2, 5</a>, etc. But the context leads us to consider them as those who took the place of rulers of Israel when she had no shepherd of her own (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I punished</span> (<span class="accented">will punish</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the goats</span> (<span class="accented">bellwethers</span>); literally, <span class="accented">will visit upon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will chastise. The same word (<span class="accented">paquad</span>) is used in the next clause in a good sense. The "goats" are the leading men, those powerful for evil, as <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>. Hath visited his flock. The reason why the evil shepherds are punished is because God visits his flock in love and care, to see their state and to relieve them from trouble (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>). The house of Judah here includes all the nation, to which it afterwards gave its name. <span class="cmt_word">Hath made</span> (<span class="accented">shall make</span>) <span class="cmt_word">them as his goodly horse</span>. The Israelites shall not only be delivered from oppression, but God shall use them as a stately war horse, richly caparisoned, to tread down enemies and triumph ever them. So he said before (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>) that he would make Judah his bow and Ephraim his arrow. (For a description of the war horse, see <a href="../../par/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19-25</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>, where Christ is represented riding on a white horse, and his saints following him on white horses.)

Attempts have been made to find the fulfilment of these prophecies (ver. 3, etc.) in certain events of Maccabean times. Thus, according to Patritius, the sin for which the Hebrews surfeited such distress at the hands of the Seleucidae (ver. 2) was their imitation of heathen practices mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:13-15 and 2 Macc. 4:7-17, when the high priest purchased his office by a bribe, and the other priests followed Greek customs. The prophet is supposed to refer specially to this state of things when he says, "They were troubled because there was no shepherd. Mine auger was kindled against the shepherds." But we have shown above that Zechariah is here speaking of the past, not of the future. There is more verisimilitude in discerning the wars and victories of Judas, his brothers and successors, in the allusions of vers 4-7. The truth is that such descriptions suit many different events, and have various applications. Though their complete fulfilment may be expected only in Messianic times and circumstances, yet we may see many anticipatory and preparative transactions, which are meant to introduce the final accomplishment. The Jewish prophet is not always foretelling certain definite events. Oftentimes he is teaching, warning, and exhorting; and generally he is enunciating great principles, the truth of which shall be clear in the future, rather than predicting particular facts. Not unfrequently commentators have neglected this consideration, and sought too curiously to restrict the prophet's words to some one issue. It may be noted, further, that where the prophetic language concerning the destiny of the restored people seems to be exaggerated and not borne out by subsequent facts, the promises are always conditioned by the moral state of the recipients. If they answered fully and consistently to God's call, the result would be such as was predicted. That the event in all respects did not correspond with the high ideal previously announced must be attributed, not to the prophet's mistake, but to the people's waywardness and disobedience.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/10-11.htm">Zechariah 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall pass through the sea with affliction.</span> In bringing his people back the Lord is ready to repeat the miracles of the Exodus. This is the general meaning of the passage; but the details present difficulties. For "he shall pass" the LXX. gives, "they shall pass through." But the reference is plainly to Jehovah, as the following clause shows. The next two words are in apposition, "the sea," "affliction." Revised Version, "the sea of affliction;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1fbf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in a strait sea;" or, as the Hebrew cannot be so translated, "in a sea, a strait;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in maris freto.</span> It seems best to take the two words simply as, "the sea, which is affliction." The Red Sea, through which Jehovah led his people, was a figure of the sufferings which they had endured in Egypt, and brought destruction upon their enemies (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 17, 24</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Smite the waves</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The river.</span> The Nile. The drying up of the waters of the Nile is a figure of the humiliation of the nations which have been guilty of enslaving the chosen people. The Nile. the representative of Egypt, is mentioned because of the allusion to the bondage in Egypt running through the paragraph. <span class="cmt_word">The pride of Assyria.</span> Pride is noted as the characteristic of Assyria (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre.</span> This may refer to the decadence of the power of Egypt, and the transference of royal authority to strangers; but, regarding the immediate context, we had better translate, "the rod of Egypt," and see in it an allusion to the oppression of the taskmasters during the sojourn in that land. All such tyranny shall be at an end (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/10-12.htm">Zechariah 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will strengthen them in the Lord.</span> I will strengthen them with myself - with my grace and power. <span class="cmt_word">They shall walk up and down in his Name.</span> They shall live in obedience to, and dependence upon, the Lord (<a href="../../par/micah/4-5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>, where see note). The Septuagint reads, "They shall boast themselves." So God will work wonders to deliver his people from the captivity of the devil, destroying all enemies, visible and invisible, which array themselves against him. This is the final fulfilment of the prophecy. The complete restoration from the Captivity is the immediate subject of the prophet's words; and between these two we may see a reference to the conversion of the Jews in the time of Christ and the apostles, which shall go on until the end.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 9"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 11"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
