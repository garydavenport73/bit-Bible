But the expression in the text is probably only equivalent to "aroused me again" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11, 13</a>, etc.). Absorbed in awe and wonder at the contemplation of the preceding vision, the prophet had fallen into a state of exhaustion and torpor, as Daniel slept after his great visions (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8, 9</a>), and the apostles were heavy with sleep on the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). From this mental prostration the angel arouses him to renewed attention. Or what is meant may be that the change wrought on the faculties by the Divine influence was as great as that between natural sleeping and waking. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <i>of</i> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <i>are</i> upon the top thereof:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What seest thou?</span> The angel does not show the vision to the prophet, but makes him describe it, and then explains its import. This vision of the candlestick, with its seven lamps fed by two olive trees, signifies that the work of rebuilding the temple, and preparing the way for the Church of the true Israel, was to be accomplished by relying, not on human resources, but on Divine aid. Thus were Zerubbabel and his people roused to perseverance and energy in their good work, of which the final sucess is assured. <span class="cmt_word">I have looked;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint), "I have seen." <span class="cmt_word">A candlestick all of gold</span>. The candelabrum as described differs in some particulars from that in the tabernacle, though the same word<span class="accented">, menorath</span>, is used in both cases (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-17.htm">Exodus 37:17</a>, etc.). In Solomon's temple there were ten candelabra (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>), which were carried away to Babylon when Jerusalem was taken (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a>). The single candelabrum of Zerubbabel's temple is mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:21 1 Macc. 4:49, 50. The one sculptured on the arch of Titus may be a truthful representation of that in Herod's temple, but probably is not the same as that in the second edifice (comp. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:04, 4). The candelabrum in the vision differed from the original one in three particulars: it had a central reservoir; it had also seven pipes; and it was supplied with oil by two olive trees. <span class="cmt_word">With a</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">howl upon the top of it.</span> The "bowl" (<span class="accented">gullah</span>) is a reservoir for oil placed at the top of the candelabrum; and from it tubes led the oil for the supply of the lamps. In the tabernacle each lamp was separate, and trimmed and filled by the ministering priests; the mystic lamps needed no human agency to keep them supplied. They were fed by the "bowl." The word is translated in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">lampas</span>; hence some have supposed that, besides the seven lamps, there was another large light in the centre; but the Greek and Latin rendering is mistaken, the word meaning "a fountain" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>), or "a ball" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>), or "a round bowl" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof.</span> The Hebrew is, literally rendered, <span class="accented">seven and seven pipes to the lamps which are upon its top.</span> The LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "And seven vessels for the lamps which are upon it;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Septem infusoria lucernis, quae erant super caput ejus</span>. These versions imply that there was one supply pipe to each of the lamps, which seems most natural. In this case, the first "seven" in the text must be an interpolation. Commentators who regard the present reading as correct have taken various ways in explaining it. Some multiply the number into itself, and make the pipes forty-nine; but this is unwarranted by Hebrew usage (Henderson). Others add the numbers together, making fourteen; but here again the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span>, which implies diversity, is an objection. The Revised Version has, "There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, taking the words distributively; but the number of tubes seems here to be unnecessarily large. Dr. Wright considers that there were two pipes to each lamp, one set connecting each to the central bowl, and one connecting the several lamps together. One, however, does not see of what particular use the second set is. Dr. Wright, p. 84, gives a drawing of the candelabrum with  its appurtenances, according to his notion of the vision. The Authorized Version seems to give the correct idea of the passage, whether we arrive at it by rejecting the first "seven," or by considering that it is repeated for emphasis' sake, as Cornelius Lapide and Pressel think: "Seven are the lamps upon it - seven, I say, and seven the pipes." Take it as we may, the point is that the oil is well and copiously supplied to the several lights.

Without man's agency the oil is separated from the berry and keeps the lamps constantly supplied (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a>).

But it may also be taken as desiring information about the whole vision.

The word is almost synonymous with the following, translated <span class="cmt_word">power</span>; and the two together mean that the effect is to be produced, not by any human means, however potent. Doubtless Zerubbabel was dispirited when he thought how much there was to do, how feeble the means at his disposal (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>), and how formidable the opposition; and nothing could better reassure him than the promise of Divine aid. <span class="cmt_word">But by my Spirit.</span> The angel does not say expressly what is to be done; but the purpose that filled the minds of Zechariah and Zerubbabel applied the word. The operations of the Spirit are manifold, and his aid alone could bring these mighty things to pass. The oil is a figure of the grace of the Holy Spirit; and as the lamps are not supplied by human hands, but directly from the olives, so the good work now undertaken shall be supported by Divine means (see on ver. 14).

All obstacles shall be removed (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4, 5</a>).

He shall commence and put the finishing stroke to the work of rebuilding the temple. Many commentators take this stone to be the one that completes the building, "the topstone." But it may well be questioned whether a building like the temple could have any such stone. An arch or a pyramid may have a crowning stone, but no other edifice; nor is there any proof that such a topstone was known or its erection celebrated. It may be a mere metaphor for the completion of the work. It is better, however, to take it as the cornerstone, to which we know great importance was attached (comp. <a href="../../par/job/38-6.htm">Job 38:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, etc.). This stone, on which the building rests, Zerubbabel will bring forth from the workshop; as the next verses say, his hands have laid the foundation. That action, already past, is represented as future, the regular commencement of the work under Zerubbabel's direction being intimated, and its happy conclusion promised. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "And I will bring forth the stone of the inheritance" - the meaning of which is obscure, though Jerome explains it by considering it an allusion to Christ.

The Targum recognizes here a Messianic prophecy: "He will reveal the Messiah whose Name is spoken of from all eternity, and he shall rule over all the kingdoms."

The completion of the material temple was a pledge of the establishment of the spiritual temple, the Church of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <i>with</i> those seven; they <i>are</i> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For who hath despised the day of small things?</span> The "small things" are the weak and poor beginning of the temple (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-3.htm">Haggai 2:3</a>); as the Targum glosses, "on account of the edifice, because it was small." Small as the present work was, it was a pledge of the full completion, and was therefore not to be despised. So the question is equivalent to, "Can any one, after these promises and prophecies, presume to be doubtful about the future?" <span class="cmt_word">For they shall rejoice</span>, etc. The subject of the verbs is that which comes last in position, the seven eyes of Jehovah; and the verse is best translated thus: "For (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> seeing that) these seven eyes of Jehovah, which run through all the earth, behold with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel." The work is not contemptible, since the Lord regards it with favour, watches, and directs it. The LXX. and Vulgate (followed nearly by the Authorized Version) make the despisers the subject of the verbs, and lamely dissociate the final clause entirely from the preceding. The version given above is in accordance with the Masoretic accentuation. <span class="cmt_word">The plummet;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the stone, the tin</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">lapidem stanneum</span>, "the stone of tin" (Vulgate). Tin is not found in Palestine; it was imported by the Phoenicians in great abundance, and from them the Jews obtained it. The supply must have come from Spain or Britain. With <span class="cmt_word">those seven.</span> The preposition is an interpolation of the Authorized Version. It should be, "even these seven," explaining who are "they" at the head of the clause. <span class="cmt_word">The eyes of the Lord.</span> The "seven eyes" have been already mentioned (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>, where see note). They are expressive of God's watchful providence and care. Which run to and fro. This clause further enforces the previous image (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).

Zerubbabel and Joshua are representatives of the civil and priestly authorities, but the text seems expressly to avoid naming any human agents, in order to show that the symbol must not be limited to individuals. Nor, indeed, must it be confined to the Jewish Church and state; it looks forward to the time when Jew and Gentile shall unite in  upholding the Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">That stand by the Lord of the whole earth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ready as his ministers to do him service. There is a reference to this passage in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-4.htm">Revelation 11:4</a>, where the "two witnesses" are called "the two olive trees.., standing Before the Lord of the earth" (Perowne). The vision, as we have seen, prefigures primarily the completion of the temple and the restoration of its worship, and secondly the establishment of the Christian Church by the advent of Messiah. The several parts of the vision may be thus explained. The candelabrum is a symbol of the Jewish Church and theocracy, in accordance with the imagery in the Apocalypse, where the seven candlesticks are seven Churches (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>). It is made of gold as precious in God's sight, and to be kept pure and unalloyed; it is placed in the sanctuary, and has seven lamps, to indicate that it is bright with the grace of God, and is meant to shed its light around at all times, as Christian men are bidden to shine like lights in the world (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). The oil that supplies the lamps is the grace of God, the influence of the Holy Spirit, which alone enables the Church to shine and to accomplish its appointed work. The two olive trees are the two authorities, viz. the civil and sacerdotal, through which God communicates his grace to the Church; these stand by the Lord Because, instituted by him, they carry out his will in the ordering, guiding, extending, and purifying his kingdom among men. The two olive branches remit their oil into one receptacle, because the two authorities, the regal and priestly, are intimately connected and united, and their action tends to one end, the promotion of God's glory in the salvation of men. In Messiah these offices are united; he is the channel of Divine grace, the source of light to the whole world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
