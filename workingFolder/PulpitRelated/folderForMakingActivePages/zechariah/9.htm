Because Jehovah has his eye on men and on Israel. Septuagint, "because the Lord looketh upon men" (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; and ver. 8 below). We may then translate, "For to Jehovah is an eye over man," etc. He sees their evil doings and their oppression of Israel, and therefore the judgment falls upon them (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>). The Authorized Version intimates a conversion of the Gentiles, of which, however, the context says nothing: and there is no sense in saying that judgment shall fall upon a particular nation when, or because, the eyes of all men look to the Lord. Wright explains thus: When the wrath of God falls on Damascus, the eyes of the heathen, as well as those of Israel, will look to the Lord, and they will marvel at the judgment and the close fulfilment of the prediction. This would be a very sound and probable exposition of the passage if the expression, "the eye of man being towards Jehovah," can mean that man marvels at his doings. <span class="cmt_word">All the tribes of Israel.</span> God watches over them to guard them from evil (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>).

The Authorized Version probably means that Hamath shall be the companion of Damascus in punishment. (For Hamath, see note on Amos 6:2.) These Syrian towns, as well as those below in Phoenicia and Philistia, shall be visited, because they were all once included in the territory promised to Israel (see <a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>l; <a href="../../par/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). The judgment was inflicted by Alexander the Great after the battle of Issus,  <span class="date">B.C. 333</span>, when Damascus was betrayed into his hands and plundered of all its enormous treasures. <span class="cmt_word">Tyrus and Zidon.</span> Tyre was taken after a siege of seven months, its walls were demolished, its houses burnt, ten thousand of its defenders were massacred, the women and children sold as slaves; and it never rose to greatness again. Zidon, originally the chief city of the country, had long been eclipsed by its daughter, Tyre: it submitted to Alexander without a struggle. <span class="cmt_word">Though it be very wise;</span> or, <span class="accented">because she is very wise.</span> The pronoun refers to Tyre, the mention of Zidon being, as it were, parenthetical. In spite of, or because of, its boasted wisdom, Tyre should suffer heavy punishment. The wisdom of Tyre is spoken of in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3, 4</a>. Wright, as the LXX., makes the clause refer to both cities, "though they be very wise." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Assum pserunt quippe sibi sapientiam valde.</span>

Wright endeavours to imitate the parouomasia, "Tyre built for herself a <span class="accented">tower."</span> It was in her strong fortifications and her amassing of riches that Tyre showed her worldly wisdom. The city was built partly on the mainland, and partly on an island nearly half a mile distant, which rose abruptly out of the water in rocky precipices, and was surrounded with walls a hundred and fifty feet high. The insular portion of the town was that which so long mocked the Macedonian's  utmost efforts, which were only successful when he had united the island to the mainland by erecting an enormous mole between them. This causeway has now become an isthmus of some half mile in width, owing to accumulations of sand and <span class="accented">debris</span>. <span class="cmt_word">As the dust</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-27.htm">2 Chronicles 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16</a>).

God declares that she shall be smitten there as she stood in the midst of the sea, which formed her bulwark, and which should soon dash over her ruins. The LXX. translates, "shall smite into the sea." Zechariah seems here to have a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-32.htm">Ezekiel 27:32</a>, "What city is like Tyres, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With fire</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/1-10.htm">Amos 1:10</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">Ashkelon shall see <i>it</i>, and fear; Gaza also <i>shall see it</i>, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ashkelon shall see it.</span> The ruin of so mighty a city as Tyre naturally filled neighbouring people with dismay. The prophet directs his attention to Philistia, and threatens its chief cities. The cities are enumerated in the same order as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>. Gath is omitted, as in <a href="../../par/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a> and <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>:. It seems never to have recovered its destruction by Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). (For Ashkelon, Gaza, and Ekron, see note on Amos 1:6.) <span class="cmt_word">Her expectation shall be ashamed.</span> The hope of aid from Tyre shall not be fulfilled. After the fall of Tyre, Alexander continued his march southwards towards Egypt, subduing the cities on his way. The siege of Gaze delayed him some months; and when it was taken, it shared the treatment of Tyre. Its governor, one Batis, a eunuch, was tied alive to the conqueror's chariot, and dragged round the walls, in cruel imitation of the fate of Hector. <span class="cmt_word">The king shall perish from Gaza.</span> No particular king is meant; but the prediction says that henceforward no king should reign in Gaze. In contrast with the Eastern policy of allowing conquered nations to retain their own rulers as tributary sovereigns, Alexander always deposed or slew reigning monarchs, and consolidated his empire by replacing them with governors of his own. The various chastisements are meted out by the prophet among the various cities, though they equally apply to all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-6.htm">Zechariah 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A Bastard.</span> The word (<span class="accented">mamzer</span>)  occurs in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a> (3, Hebrew), where it may possibly mean "a stranger." It is  generally considered to signify one whose birth has a blemish in it - one born of incest or adultery. In Deuteronomy the LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "one of harlot birth;" here, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "foreigner." The Vulgate has <span class="accented">separator</span>, which is explained as meaning either the Lord, who as Judge divides the just from the unjust, or the Conqueror, who divides the spoil and assigns to captives their fate. Here it doubtless signifies "a bastard race" (as the Revised Version margin translates); a rabble of aliens shall inhabit Ashdod, which shall lose its own native population. The Targum explains it differently, considering that by the expression is meant that Ashdod shall be inhabited by Israelites, who are deemed "strangers" by the Philistines. <span class="cmt_word">Ashdod</span> (see note on Amos 1:8). <span class="cmt_word">The pride.</span> All in which they prided themselves.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, <i>shall be</i> for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Personifying Philistia, the prophet declares that she shall cease to practise idolatry, and shall be incorporated in Israel. <span class="cmt_word">I will take away his blood out of his mouth.</span> This refers to the practice of drinking the blood of sacrifices as an act of worship, or of eating the victims with the blood - a practice strictly forbidden to the Israelites (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abominations</span>. Sacrifices offered to idols, and afterwards eaten. The two clauses intimate the entire abolition of idolatry. Many see in this prediction a reference to the doings of the Maccabees; how, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Judas destroyed the altars and idols in Azotus (1 Macc. 5:68); Jonathan again took that city, and burned it and the neighbouring towns, and, besieging Ashkelon, was received with great honour by the inhabitants, and confirmed in the possession of this place and Ekron (1 Macc. 10:84, etc.); and Simon stormed Gaza (? Gazara, a place near Ashdod), cleansed the houses of idols, "put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the Law" (1 Macc. 13:47, 48). But though such events partially fulfil the prophecy, the seer looks forward to a greater issue, and in these comparatively petty details beholds the working of the great principle that all nations shall be subdued to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">He that remaineth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even he, shall be for our God;</span> better, <span class="accented">he too shall be left</span> (or, <span class="accented">a remnant</span>) <span class="accented">for our God.</span> The Philistine shall become a choice and elect remnant unto the God of the Israelites, and no longer regarded as alien and impure. <span class="cmt_word">As a governor;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "head over a thousand." which the word <span class="accented">alluph</span>  means (<a href="../../par/zechariah/12-5.htm">Zechariah 12:5, 6</a>). It is used of the chiefs of Edom in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15, 16</a>, etc., where the Authorized Version gives "dukes." The tribes of Israel were divided into thousands, consisting of families, each of which was held together by closer affinities than the mere tribal bond (see note on Micah 5:2). The meaning is that the Philistine shall be admitted into the commonwealth of Israel as one of her chiefs. <span class="cmt_word">Ekron as a Jebusite.</span> "Ekron" is equivalent to "the Ekronite," who again stands in the place of all the Philistines. The Jebusites were the ancient possessors of Zion, who held their position till the days of David, and, when at last conquered by him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>, etc.), were incorporated into his nation, and, as we may infer from Araunah's conduct, adopted his religion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-23.htm">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>). God promises here that the Philistines, like the Jebusites, shall be absorbed into the Jewish Church. Mr. Drake ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) curiously renders, "He shall be as Eleph (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>) in Judah, and Ekron as Jebusi," explaining that the cities of Philistia were to be incorporated into Judaea. The conquests of Alexander conduced to the conversion of the heathen and their reception into the Church of God; and the general principle enunciated by all the prophets was tiros abundantly confirmed. But it is rot easy to discover the exact historical fulfilment of the latter part of this prophecy, concerning the merging of the Philistines in the Jewish nation. Josephus ('Ant.,' 13:15. 4) tells us that, about  <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>, the Jews held most of their cities, destroying some whose inhabitants refused to become proselytes. In the time of our Lord, by reason of intermarriage and social intercourse, the Philistines had ceased to be regarded as a separate nation; and a little later Philistia, far from being considered as alien and hostile, under the form Palestine, gave its name to the whole country. Christianity, too, made rapid progress in this district, so that the psalmist's words received herein a fulfilment, "Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Gush; this one was born there" (<a href="../../par/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-8.htm">Zechariah 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - While the heathen world suffers the judgment of God, he protects his own people. <span class="cmt_word">I will encamp about</span> (<span class="accented">for the protection of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my house.</span> God's house, or family, is the kingdom and Church of Israel, as <a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>.

Others, pointing differently, render, "as a garrison," or "rampart." <span class="cmt_word">Because of</span> (<span class="accented">against</span>) <span class="cmt_word">him that passeth by,</span> etc. Against all hostile attacks. The phrase, "him that passeth by and him that returneth," is used of an enemy making incursions, or attacking at various points (see note on Zechariah 7:14). The Vulgate gives the whole clause thus: <span class="accented">Circumdabo domum meam ex his, qui militant mihi euntes et revertentes</span>, "I will defend my house with a guard chosen from those who serve me and do my will," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> angels. But this seems far from the signification of the Hebrew. Pusey restricts the meaning to the proceedings of Alexander, who passed by Judaea on his way to Egypt, and returned by the same route, without doing any injury to Jerusalem. Here comes in the Talmudic story related by Josephus ('Ant.,' 11:08). The Jews "repaid the protection of Persia with a devoted loyalty, which prompted them to refuse the demand of submission made by Alexander during the siege of Tyre. He marched to chastise them after the fall of Gaza, and the beautiful city had already risen before his view on the hill of Zion, when he found the high priest Jaddua waiting his approach at the watch station of Sapha, clad in his robes of gold and purple, and followed by a train of priests and citizens in pure white. The conqueror bowed in reverence to the Holy Name upon the high priest's frontlet; and, being asked by Parmenio the reason of his conduct, said that in a dream at Dium, he had seen the God of Jaddua, who encouraged him to pass over into Asia, and promised him success. Then entering Jerusalem, he offered sacrifice in the temple, heard the prophecy of Daniel about himself; and granted certain privileges to all the Jews throughout his empire. The desire to honour a shrine so celebrated as, the Jewish temple is quite in accordance with the conduct of Alexander at Ilium and Ephesus, Gordium and Tyre. The privileges he is said to have conferred upon the Jews were enjoyed under his successors, and some minor matters have been adduced in confirmation of the story. On the other hand, the classical writers are entirely silent on the subject, and the details of Josephus involve grave historical inconsistencies. It seems not an unreasonable conjecture that the story is an embellishment of some incident that occurred when the high priest came to Gaza to tender the submission of the Jews. But we must not dismiss it without a remark on the vast influence which the conquests of Alexander had in bringing the Jews into closer relations with the rest of Asia, and so preparing them to fulfil their ultimate destiny as Christians" (P. Smith, 'History of the World,' 1:60, etc). <span class="cmt_word">Oppressor</span>. The word is used for "taskmaster" in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>.

There is no other "King" of Israel to whom it can refer. Our blessed Lord himself, by his abnormal actions on Palm Sunday, plainly assumed the part of the predicted King, and meant the people to recognize in him the promised Messiah (see the full discussion of the subject in Dr. Pusey's notes, pp. 556, etc.). <span class="accented">Thy King.</span> A king of thine own race, no stranger, but one predestined for thee. He who was foretold by all the prophets, who was to occupy the throne of David, and reign forever (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-1.htm">Psalm 45:1, 6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>). <span class="accented">Unto thee</span>.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">salvator</span>; so the Syriac and Chaldee. The genius of the language requires the participle to be taken passively, as it is in two other passages where it occurs (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). The context has seemed to some to demand that it be understood in an active sense, thus contrasting him who came to save with the haughty Grecian conqueror, whose progress was marked by bloodshed. But the usual meaning of the word affords a satisfactory sense. The King who comes is "saved," endowed with salvation, either as being protected and upheld by God (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1, 2, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>), or as being victorious and so able to aid his people. In this latter view, the active sense is included in the passive. His own deliverance is a sure sign of the deliverance of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Lowly</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "meek;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">pauper</span> - meek and lowly, as Christ himself says (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>),far removed from warlike pomp and worldly greatness. The word is also rendered "afflicted," and would then be in accordance with the description in <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-53:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Riding upon an ass.</span> In illustration of his poor or afflicted estate; it is this, and not merely the peace. fulness of his reign, that is meant by this symbolical action, as we see by the following clause, where the youthfulness of the animal is the point enforced. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">even, and that</span>) <span class="cmt_word">upon a colt the foal of an ass;</span> such as she asses bear, and one not trained; as the evangelist says, "whereon never man sat." Christ sat upon the foal. In old times judges and men of distinction rode upon asses (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>); but from Solomon's days the horse had been used, not only in war, but on all state occasions (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>); and the number of horses brought back on the return from Babylon is specially mentioned (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-66.htm">Ezra 2:66</a>). So to predicate of a King that he would come to his capital riding, not on a war horse, but on a young, unbroken ass, showed at once that he himself was not to be considered a victorious general or a worldly potentate, and that his kingdom was not to be won or maintained by carnal arms. This is signified more fully in the following verse, which describes the character and extent of Messiah's kingdom.

From the use of these terms here it cannot be concluded that the author wrote at a time when the two kingdoms existed side by side. In the first place, the description of the whole people is given poetically, and must not be taken to have more significance than is intended; and secondly, in ch. 8:13, which is confessedly post-exilian, the "house of Judah," and the "house of Israel" are distinguished. Dr. Cheyne notes, too, that in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:15-28), who prophesied during the Captivity, the ten tribes are distinguished by the name of  Ephraim, and pertinently asks why such term may not be also used by one who wrote after the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The battle bow stands for all weapons of war.</span> That Messiah's kingdom should be peaceful and peace-bringing, see the prophecies (<a href="../../par/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-7</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall speak peace unto the heathen.</span> He will extend this peace to all the world, teaching the heathen to receive his spiritual rule, to compose their differences, to lay aside their arms, and live as one united family (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From sea even to sea.</span> Geographically, the phrase means from the Dead Sea on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, from whence our passage is derived. Poetically, an Eastern sea, perhaps, is supposed to bound that side of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">From the river even to the ends of the earth.</span> From the Enphrates unto the utmost limits of the world (see <a href="../../par/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). Both expressions obtain an unlimited significance, and show the universal extent of Messiah's kingdom; for in him, according to the promise made to Abraham, all the families of the earth should be blessed.

The absence of water may be notified either to imply that the tortures of thirst were added to the horror of the situation, or to intimate that the prisoners were not hopelessly drowned therein.
