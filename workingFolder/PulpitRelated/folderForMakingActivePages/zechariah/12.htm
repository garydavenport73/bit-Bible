This is the title of the second oracle, corresponding to that at the head of ch. 9. Though the literal Israel has been rejected, as we saw in the last "burden," a new people of God. arises (<a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>), the Messianic theocracy, which is also called Israel, whose fortunes the prophet herein delineates, describing its probation, its contests, triumph, and development. The body is like its Head; as the good Shepherd, Christ, was persecuted and rejected, so his members, the true Israelites, suffer at the hand of the world and Satan, before they are finally glorified. Some critics suppose that "Israel" here is written by mistake for "Jerusalem," as possibly in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> (see note on Zechariah 1:19). It is best to put a full stop after "Israel," and begin a new sentence with "Thus saith the Lord," or "The saying of Jehovah." <span class="cmt_word">Which stretcheth forth the heavens,</span> etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). The attributes of God. are mentioned here that all may believe that what he has promised, that he is able to perform. He is not only the Creator, but also the Pro-server of all things (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2-4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Formeth the spirit of man within him.</span> God creates the souls of men, and moulds and guides them.

This Jerome explains to mean that any one who crosses the threshold of Jerusalem in hostile guise shall totter and fall. Jerusalem is the capital and type of the Messianic theocracy; the hostile powers of the world crowd round her, like thirsting men round a bowl of wine; but they find the drought is fatal to them; they stagger back discomfited and destroyed. The figure of the cup and drunkenness is often employed to denote the judgment of God upon transgressors, which makes them incapable of defence or escape (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 51:39, 57; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The people;</span> <span class="accented">the peoples</span> (so vers. 3, 4, 6).

Pusey and Revised Version render, "And upon Judah also shall it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'the burden'] be in the siege against Jerusalem." Cheyne, "And also on [or, 'over '] Judah it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the protection and deliverance implied in the first clause of the verse] shall be, in the siege," etc. Any  interpretation of the passage which makes Judah join with the enemy in attacking Jerusalem is precluded by the very intimate union between Judah and Jerusalem denoted in vers. 4-7, and by the hostility of the nations against Judah. Cheyne's explanation is hardly a natural one, however suitable. Lowe ('Hebr. Stud. Comm.') renders, "And also on Judah [shall fall this reeling] during the siege [which is to take place] against Jerusalem." It seems best to render, with Alexander, "Also against Judah shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only the mother city, but all the country, shall be exposed to hostile invasion. This suits ver. 5, where the chieftains of Judah are represented as trusting in the valour of the inhabitants of Jerusalem when they are incurring the same danger.

Jerome supposes here an allusion to a custom in the towns of Palestine, which prevailed to his day (and, indeed, in Syria even now), of placing round stones of great weight at certain distances, by lifting which the youths tested their bodily strength. But we do not know that this custom existed in Zcehariah's time, and the nations are not gathered together for amusement or display of strength, but for hostile attack.

The prophet declares that the open towns and villages of Judah, which can offer no effectual resistance to an enemy like the fortified city Jerusalem, shall be saved by the aid of God, as so often has happened in old time.

To "look upon or unto" implies trust, longing, and reverence (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>). We may say generally that the clause intimates that the people, who had grieved and offended God by their sins and ingratitude, should repent and turn to him in faith. But there was a literal fulfilment of this piercing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> slaying (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-3.htm">Zechariah 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>), when the Jews crucified the Messiah, him who was God and Man, and of whom, as a result of the hypostatic union, the properties of one nature are often predicated of the other. Thus St. Paul says that the Jews crucified "the Lord of glory" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>), and bids the Ephesian elders "feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; for the reading <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, see the critics). St. John (<a href="../../par/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>) refers to these words of Zechariah as a prophecy of the Crucifixion (camp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>). The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, "They shall look to me because they insulted," either reading the last verb differently, or understanding it figuratively in the sense of assailing with cutting words; but there is no doubt about the true reading and interpretation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Aspicient ad me quem confixerunt.</span> "Me" has been altered in some manuscripts into "him:" but this is an evident gloss received into the text for controversial purposes, or to obviate the supposed impropriety of representing Jehovah as slain by the impious. That St. John seems to sanction this reading is of no critical importance, as he is merely referring to the prophecy historically, and does not profess to give the very wording of the prophet. A suffering Messiah was not an unknown idea in Zechariah's time. He has already spoken of the Shepherd as despised and ill-treated, and a little further on (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>) he intimates that he is stricken with the sword. The prophecies of Isaiah had familiarized him with the same notion (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, etc.). And when he represents Jehovah as saying, "Me whom they pierced," it is not merely that in killing his messenger and representative they may be said to have killed him, but the prophet, by inspiration, acknowledges the two natures in the one Person of Messiah, even as Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>) called him the "Mighty God," and the psalmists often speak to the same effect (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). The "looking to" the stricken Messiah began when they who saw that woeful sight smote their breasts (<a href="../../par/luke/23-48.htm">Luke 23:48</a>); it was carried on by the preaching of the apostles; it shall continue till all Israel is converted; it is re-enacted whenever penitent sinners turn to him whom they have crucified by their sins. Critics have supposed that the person whose murder is deplored is Isaiah, or Urijah, or Jeremiah; but none of these fulfill the prediction in the text. <span class="cmt_word">They shall mourn for him.</span> There is a change of persons here. Jehovah speaks of the Messiah as distinct in Person from himself. <span class="cmt_word">As one mourneth for his only son...  for his firstborn.</span> The depth and poignancy of this mourning are expressed by a double comparison, the grief felt at the loss of an only son, and of the firstborn. Among the Hebrews the preservation of the family was deemed of vast importance, and its extinction regarded as a punishment and a curse, so that the death of an only son would be the heaviest blow that could happen (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>). Peculiar privileges belonged to the firstborn, and his loss would be estimated accordingly (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). The mention of "piercing," just above, seems to connect the passage with the Passover solemnities  and the destruction of the firstborn of the Egyptians (see <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 6. p. 131, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - As if the above comparisons were not strong enough, the prophet presents a new one, referring to an historical event, which occasioned a universal mourning in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As the mourning of</span> (<span class="accented">at</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</span> This is generally supposed to refer to the death of King Josiah of a wound received at Megiddo, in the battle with Pharaoh-Necho ( <span class="date">B.C. 60</span>) ),and to the national lamentation made for him and long observed on the anniversary of the calamity (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-25</a>). This universal and perennial mourning is a figure of the continual remembrance of the death of Christ in the Church. There is a difficulty about the identification of Hadadrimmon. St. Jerome says it was a place in the Plain of Megiddo, near Jezreel, and known in his day by the name of Maximianopolis. This is supposed to be <span class="accented">Rummaneh</span>, seven miles northwest of Jezreel, on the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. But the identification is far from certain. The Assyrian name given to the place may, as Lowe suggests, be a confirmation of the post-exilian origin of the prophecy. The site of Megiddo also is undetermined, though Condor suggests <span class="accented">Mujedda</span>, a ruined city about three miles south of Bethshean. The opinion that the name Hadadrimmon is that of a Syrian or Phoenician god, whose rites were celebrated as those of Adonis ("the weeping for Tammuz" of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), is preposterous; and the idea that the prophet would thus refer to the worship of an abominable idol is one that could have occurred only to disbelievers in revelation. The LXX., mistaking the text, gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "as mourning for a pomegranate cut off in the plain."

The LXX. gives, "the tribe of Simeon," instead of "the family of Shimei." But there is no reason for singling out this tribe. In one sense, this prophecy began to be fulfilled when a great company of priests were converted by the preaching of the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>).
