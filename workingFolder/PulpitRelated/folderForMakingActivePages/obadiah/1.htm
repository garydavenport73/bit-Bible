Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vision of Obadiah.</span> This is the title of the book, declaring from whom and through whom the revelation comes (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>). Under the word "vision" in prophetic language is included, not only what the seer saw, the mental picture presented to his inner senses, but also all that he is commissioned to disclose or enunciate. <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom</span>. The prophet declares that God speaks through him. One might have expected that the actual words of Jehovah would follow here instead of tidings heard from him. And this difficulty has led some to suppose these introductory words spurious or the insertion of a later hand, others to include them and the rest of the verse in a parenthesis, so as to begin the "vision" with God's words in ver. 2. But these suggestions are unnecessary. The prophet, as the mouthpiece of God, calls his own words the message of the Lord - signifies that what had been revealed to his mind he was bound to communicate to others as a direct warning from God. The Edomites were the descendants of Esau, and bound by ties of blood to the Israelites; but they had always been their most bitter enemies (<a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>). They are regarded as a type of the powers of the world hostile to true religion, whose end is destruction. <span class="cmt_word">We have heard.</span> "We" - I myself and other prophets; or the Judaeans, the prophet identifying himself with his countrymen. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, I heard, so <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>; Arabic, "ye have heard." <span class="cmt_word">A rumour;</span> <span class="accented">a report</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">auditum</span> (Vulgate). It means here "tidings" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: and <a href="../../par/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An ambassador;</span> <span class="accented">a messenger</span>; as though the prophet saw the minister of God's wrath going forth among the heathen to rouse them to war against Edom. Perowne thinks that there is an allusion to the composite character of Nebuchadnezzar's army with which he attacked the Edomites. The Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>: so the Syriac, Chaldee, and Symmachus translate "message." This rendering is explained by the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">The heathen</span> (<span class="accented">goyim</span>); <span class="accented">the nations, as</span> vers. 2, 15. <span class="cmt_word">Arise ye, and let us rise.</span> This has been taken as if "arise ye" were the herald's message, and "let us rise" the response of the nations echoing his words; but it is more forcible to consider the whole clause as the message, the ambassador joining himself with the heathen as their leader and comrade in the war of vengeance. Vers. 1-9 are incorporated in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a>.

Of the rook. This may be Sela, or Petra, as <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>. The country inhabited by the Edomites lay on the eastern side of the Arabah, and extended from the south end of the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf. It was a region of mountain and valley, difficult, and in many parts inaccessible from the west. Rock-hewn dwellings are found everywhere in those hills, the Edomites, when they expelled the aboriginal Troglodytes (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12, 22</a>), having adopted their habitations and excavated new ones on the same model throughout the whole district. These were useful, not only as being secure from hostile attack, but as cool retreats in the summer of that scorching tract, and offering a warm shelter in winter when fuel was scarce. Petra, the capital, lay completely hidden at the end of a rocky defile some two miles long, and could easily be defended against an enemy by a handful of men. (For a description of this remarkable place, see the Introduction, &sect; I.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle.</span> The Hebrew gives "nest" as the subject of both clauses, thus: "Though thou exaltest... and settest thy nest." Job (<a href="../../par/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27, 28</a>) speaks of the eagle making its nest in the highest rocks. The metaphor is found in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>. Will I bring thee down (<a href="../../par/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>). The seizure of Petra by the Nabathaeans is the judgment referred to in this part of the prophecy; the complete ruin is mentioned later (vers. 18, etc.).

Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:10) gives, "secret places." Keil notes that Petra was a great emporium of the trade between Arabia and Syria, and that in it great treasures were stored (Diod. Sic., 19:95). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee <i>even</i> to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, <i>and</i> prevailed against thee; <i>they that eat</i> thy bread have laid a wound under thee: <i>there is</i> none understanding in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In this dire calamity Eden shall be deserted by her friends and allies - a punishment for her behaviour to her sister Judah. <span class="cmt_word">The men of thy confederacy.</span> The LXX. and the Vulgate annex these words to the following clause. The allies intended may be Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, who joined together to resist Nebuchadnezzar, and were smitten by him (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>); or, as Perowne thinks, the Chaldeans themselves, who, though the Edomites had aided in the attack on Jerusalem, afterwards turned against them. Have brought thee even to the border; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "They sent thee forth unto thy borders;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Usque ad terminum emiserunt ii.</span> Keil and others explain this to mean that the Edomites send ambassadors to their allies, asking help, but these messengers are conducted back to the frontier with their request not granted, because the allies are unwilling to entangle themselves in the fate of Eden. It is easier to understand the passage in this way - Thy very allies have assisted the enemy in ex-polling thee from thy borders, and refusing to receive fugitives who came to them. The men that were at peace with thee. Either the same as "the men of thy confederacy," or the neighbouring Arabian tribes who resorted to Petra for commercial reasons (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>). The phrase here, literally, <span class="accented">the men of thy peace</span>, is found in <a href="../../par/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> and Jot. 38:22. Have deceived thee, by not bringing the expected help; and have prevailed against thee, by actual violence. They that eat thy bread. The Hebrew is simply, "thy bread," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of thy bread. Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui comedunt tecum</span>; <span class="accented">the</span> LXX. omits the words. The expression (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>)  implies the closest friendship, especially in Eastern lands, where such a tie is of general obligation. <span class="cmt_word">Have laid a wound under thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">lay a snare under thee</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "they set snares under thee;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ponent insidias subter te</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22</a>). Another interpretation is this: "As thy bread (which they as friends were bound to offer) they lay a sling under thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prepare an ambush for thee, like Jael did for Sisera. Pusey notes the climax in this verse - not confederates only, but friends; not friends only, but familiar friends, indebted to them. Those banded with them should expel them from their country; those at peace should prevail against them in war; those who ate their bread should requite them with treachery. There is none understanding in him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Edom. The shock of this defection of allies and the sudden destruction that has overwhelmed them have deprived the Edomites of their wonted sagacity and prudence. They know not whither to turn or what to do. The following verse expands this thought. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise <i>men</i> out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - Their vaunted wisdom and their boasted courage shall fail, for God shall take them away.

The Edomites were celebrated for wisdom or practical philosophy (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; Baruch 3:22, 23). <span class="cmt_word">Mount of Esau</span> (vers. 9, 19, 21).

The iniquity of such conduct is aggravated by the fact that the victim was the "brother Jacob," who was commanded not to hate the Edomites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>). This enjoined friendship was not reciprocated by the descendants of Esau. Whether from envy at the superior privileges of Israel, or from other causes, the Edomites, from the time of Moses, had always been actively hostile to the Israelites. They had been subdued by David, but had lately rebelled and scoured their independence, and were always looking for an opportunity of revenging themselves on their conquerors (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shame shall cover thee.</span> Shame for the destruction that hath overtaken thee (<a href="../../par/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be cut off forever</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>; see Introduction, &sect; I.).

There are two interpretations of this passage. By the first, the people addressed are considered to be the Jews, and the word "drunk" is  taken metaphorically in both clauses (see note on Nahum 3:11). The meaning is then this - As ye Jews, who are upon my holy mountain, the people of election, have not escaped from suffering the wrath of God, so all the nations shell feel the same, and that to a much more terrible extent. Confirmatory of this explanation is the language of Jeremiah, who (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>) bids all the nations to drink the cup of God's wrath, beginning at Jerusalem and passing on to Edom, and then says, in answer to any who refuse the offered draught, "Lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?" The same notion is found also in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a> and <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>, etc. But there are objections to this view of the passage. The previous verse enunciated the doctrine of retribution; this verse confirms the former with the words, "for as ye," etc. It would be no proof of the <span class="accented">lex</span> <span class="accented">talionis</span> on the Edomites to cite what had happened to the Jews. What is wanted is an assertion that what they had done should be repaid to them in like coin, Besides, the prophecy is nominally addressed to the Edomites, not to the Jews, and it would he most harsh to change the subject suddenly here. "Upon my mountain" cannot be equivalent to "ye who are upon my mountain;" nor is such an expression ever used to signify "Judaeans." It is best, therefore, to take the clause as referring to the Edomites and their comrades, who, after their victory, indulged in unseemly revelry, and profaned the mountain hallowed by God's presence in the temple with their idolatrous festival The "drinking" in this first clause is literal; in the following clause it is figurative. Septuaguint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "thou didst drink," which makes the connection of the subject here with that in ver. 15 more evident, and it has probably been altered by the translators for that purpose. <span class="cmt_word">So shall all the heathen drink continually.</span> The prophet plays on the word "drink." The nations shall drink, not wine, but the wrath of God (<a href="../../par/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>).

So the first portion of the verse means, as Henderson says, the number of Israelitish captives which were found in Phoenicia, into which they had been sold at different times as slaves (comp. vers. 11, 14; <a href="../../par/joel/3-6.htm">Joel 3:6, 7</a>). <span class="accented">This host.</span> Not a general deportation, but only the portion of the people referred to. From this expression some have inferred that Obadiah himself was one of this body. This is possible, but not necessary. The captives who are among the Canaanites, even <span class="accented">unto Zarephath</span>; <span class="accented">as far as Zarephath</span>, were probably placed there for safe keeping before being sold into Greece and other countries. Zarepbath ("Melting house"), the <span class="accented">Sarepta</span> of St. Luke (Luke 4:26), now <span class="accented">Surafend</span> or <span class="accented">Sarafend</span>, and celebrated in the history of Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>, etc.), lay between Tyre and Sidon, a little inland, and was a town of some importance, as its ruins prove. The captivity of Jerusalem. The captives from Jerusalem. Which is in Sepharad; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;</span> "as far as Ephrathah;"  Vulgate, <span class="accented">quae in Bosphoro est.</span> The name occurs nowhere else in the Bible, and its identification cannot be established. Jerome suggests, in his commentary, that it is the Assyrian for "boundary," and not a proper name at all. The Peshito and the rabbins And modern Jews interpret it as "Spain." Keil supposes it to be "Sparta;" Pusey, "Sardis." For this last explanation some ground has been found in an inscription of Nakshi-Rustam, where a place called <span class="accented">Cparda</span> occurs in a list of tribes between Cappadocia and Ionia; and <span class="accented">Cparda is</span> considered to be the Persian form of <span class="accented">Sardis</span> (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 445, etc.). A further confirmation of this identification is found in the complaint of Joel (Joel 3:6 [4:6, Hebrew], that the Phoenicians had sold Israelites "unto the sons of the Grecians." Professor Sayce, in a note to G. Smith's 'History of Babylonia,' p. 156, places "Saparda" on the Black Sea. It may be questioned, however, whether some town nearer Judaea is not intended. Ewald would read "Sepharam," a town in North Palestine. The two bodies of captives <span class="cmt_word">shall possess the cities of the south.</span> The Negeb. The cities are named in <a href="../../par/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a>.

The judges had a twofold character - they were deliverers and governors, as in the present ease. Here the immediate reference is to Zerubbabel and the valiant Maccabees, who severely punished the Idumeans (2 Macc. 10:15, etc.; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:09. 1).

But the "judging" is not only the taking of vengeance on Edom and that which it represents, the expression includes the notion of governing; so that the prophet looks forward to the time when the heathen shall submit themselves to the dominion of the people of God, and, as the following clause foretells, "the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ" (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom shall be the Lord's.</span> No earthly accomplishment could fulfil this great announcement.
