This, if we may judge from the particular language here used, had been brought about at the bands of <span class="cmt_word">the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp</span>, now first particularized. The parallel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-25.htm">2 Kings 8:25</a>), wanting both of these items, states that this reign began in the twelfth year of Joram of Israel.

In this and the following two verses stress is laid on the evil counsel and the sources of it that prejudiced Ahaziah to his ruin. Although the parallel wants these direct statements, perhaps it scarcely says less, when it says (ver. 27), <span class="cmt_word">"</span>For he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab."

The words of this verse and the next are almost identical with the parallel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth-Gilead</span>. It will be remembered that Ahab failed when he solicited and obtained the help of Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3-36</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3-34</a>) in his enterprise against Ramoth-Gilead. The present attempt, however, seems to have had a different issue (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14, 15</a>). The Syrians; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The initial radical here should be <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, from neglect of observing which the Septuagint has translated "archers" (relate).

This feature of the history the writer of Chronicles wishes to exhibit, as usual. <span class="cmt_word">Ramah</span>; <span class="accented">i.q.</span> Ramoth-Gilead. <span class="cmt_word">Jezreel</span>.

The "against" is the simple preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, and need intend nothing more than "to meet" Jehu; not to meet him hostilely. What the manner of the meeting was, however, we know from <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-21.htm">2 Kings 9:21, 22, 27, 28</a>. The history of this and following two verses is here given very briefly; much must be filled in to give its full explanation, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11-29</a><span class="cmt_word">. Whom the Lord had anointed to out off the house of Ahab</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> had raised him to the throne, possessed of the characteristic qualities which he had for <span class="accented">this</span> purpose (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jehu the son of Nimshi</span>. Strictly, "the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-8.htm">2 Chronicles 22:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Executing judgment upon the house of Ahab</span>. The description of all this is sufficiently graphically scattered along the verses of <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24 - 11:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And found the princes of Judah</span> (see especially <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-7.htm">2 Kings 10:7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-13.htm">2 Kings 11:13-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah</span>. This both explains and is explained by <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-12.htm">2 Kings 10:12-14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That ministered to Ahaziah</span>. Even this enigmatical little clause receives its probable explanation from the last clause of ver. 13 in last quotation foregoing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-9.htm">2 Chronicles 22:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he <i>is</i> the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him...  brought him...  buried him.</span> This verse, which at the first sight seems at variance with <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27, 28</a>, is perhaps a simply surprising instance of undesigned corroboration of history by the treatment of different historians. The verse, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, corrects the italics of <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>; expunging them throws their proper force into the words, "at the going up to Gur," showing that Jehu reckoned on that steep kill to enable his pursuing warriors to overtake Ahaziah; makes a sufficiently possible harmony, to say the least, in respect of the remaining incidents narrated of his life - that he made for the time a successful flight to Megiddo, afterwards sought to hide in deeper retirement in Samaria, was thence brought to Jehu at Megiddo, there eventually slain before his eyes, and by his own servants, who must be supposed to have had some attachment to him, but probably with the sanction of Jehu himself, conveyed "in a chariot to Jerusalem" for sepulture "in the sepulchre of his fathers in the city of David" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-28.htm">2 Kings 9:28</a>). The fact that he received decent burial being due to the God-fearing character of his grandfather, and that this should find its record on the page of the book that will last while the world lasts, that very page already two thousand five hundred years old, is a most touching consideration. Megiddo was on the Esdraelon or Jezreel plain, that stretched between the hills of Galilee and those of Mount Ephraim or Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Had no power to keep still the kingdom</span>. The undoubted meaning of this clause is that there was no one of the house of Ahaziah who could succeed him. The Hebrew text does not say, "no one left," etc. But the allusion can scarcely be to anything but the fact that transpires in our ver. 11 (where only Joash is mentioned as a son, and with him a nurse), viz. that his only surviving son was an infant, The king's sons (presumably sons of Ahaziah and grandsons of her own) were among the "seed royal," whom the wicked Athaliah had "destroyed." Gesenius says that the words that wrap in them the slight ambiguity, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, are a phrase peculiar to the later Hebrew, and he instances nine examples, all of which come from Daniel or Chronicles, the virtue of the phrase amounting to the <span class="accented">ports ease</span> of the Latin. Translate, <span class="accented">And there was no one of the house of Ahaziah able for the kingdom</span>, the exacter conditions of the case not being recorded. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-10.htm">2 Chronicles 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when Athaliah</span>. For parallel to the end of the chapter, see <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1-3</a>. The words, of <span class="cmt_word">the house of Judah</span>, are here carefully supplied, wanting in parallel.

We are here told, what is not mentioned in the parallel, that Jehosheba was "wife of Jehoiada the priest," probably the high priest. Nor is this negatived by the fact that the name is not found (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>.) in the line from Aaron to Jozadak; for this is only the line of <span class="accented">Jozadak's</span> ancestors, all of whom were not high priests. <span class="cmt_word">Joash</span> is to be heard of again (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-21.htm">2 Kings 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1</a>).
