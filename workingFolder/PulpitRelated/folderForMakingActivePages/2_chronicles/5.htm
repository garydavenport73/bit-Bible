The temple-building, which had been commenced in Solomon's fourth year, had occupied seven years in construction (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>), but another thirteen years in furnishing (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1, 2</a>). The record of Chronicles is, of course, in some respects somewhat more sketchy than that of Kings; and the correct view of the chronology has in both writers to be sought and read between the lines. It was when the house and "all the work designed for the house of the Lord was finished," that (ver. 2) "Solomon assembled the elders," etc., and arranged for the solemn dedication; that is, when four years of his reign, and seven years of building and thirteen years of furnishing, etc., had elapsed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which <i>is</i> Zion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Comparing the language of this and the following verse with that used on the occasion of David's bringing up of the ark to Zion, found in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13.htm">1 Chronicles 13</a>. and 15, some have thought that a considerable difference of tone is perceptible, and that indication is given of the intention, or at any rate a feeling, even if more or less unconscious, on the part of Solomon, that times were ripe for a demonstration, that should partake less of the enthusiasm of the mass, so far as his own summons might be concerned, and more of the form and dignity of the chief and representative men of the nation. This view can hardly be pressed. The very word "wherefore" in ver. 3 goes far to discredit it. And any difference that may be apparent in the language is far more probably and easily attributable to the old cause of the narrower, though intenser, interest of the writer of Chronicles.

This commenced on the fifteenth of the seventh month, named Ethanim (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>). With this the festivals of the sacred year closed.

This tabernacle, then, and these holy vessels all, are carried into the new temple, as venerated relics and sacred mementoes of a memorable past of vicissitude. But the ark had still its ministry to perform (ver. 7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-6.htm">2 Chronicles 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">King</span> <span class="cmt_word">Solomon and all the congregation... </span> sacrificed; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of course, with the intervention of their priests.

A similar intransitive occurs in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Were seen from the ark</span>. The words, "from the ark," are here probably by misposition, and should follow the words, <span class="cmt_word">the staves projected</span>; while the parallel tells us what should be in their place here, namely, "from the holy place" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>). The confusion and omission will merely lie with some copyists, for five manuscripts show the words "from the holy place." There it is unto this day. The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>)reads, "<span class="cmt_word">there they are unto this day</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the staves. In either case, whether the ark or the staves were spoken of, the memorandum is exceedingly interesting and noteworthy, as a patent bare copy of an old record dating before the destruction of the temple, on the part of whether the writer of Kings or Chronicles. Plainly the historian touches ground, and shows us that <span class="accented">we</span> do also; for it is evident that, far from cunningly devised fable, he has before him in either case an <span class="accented">original</span> document. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-10.htm">2 Chronicles 5:10</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There was</i> nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put <i>therein</i> at Horeb, when the LORD made <i>a covenant</i> with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nothing in the ark save the two tables</span> (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>; and <a href="../../par/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>; then Exodus 24:12; 25:16; 31:18; 32:19; 34:1, 4, 29; 40:20). The stones were therefore now, in Solomon's time, nearly four hundred and ninety years old. Why the "golden pot" and "Aaron's rod" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>) were not there does not appear. The language of the Epistle is partially confirmed, at any rate in harmony with <a href="../../par/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>. Possibly they may have now been removed by Solomon, but it seems very unlikely that, if so, no mention of the removal is made. On the other hand, the "book of the Law" had not been consigned to the ark, but to a place "by the side of" it (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-25.htm">Deuteronomy 31:25-27</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-11.htm">2 Chronicles 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy <i>place</i>: (for all the priests <i>that were</i> present were sanctified, <i>and</i> did not <i>then</i> wait by course:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10</a>) shows the first half of this verse and the last sentence of ver. 13 to make its tenth verse. All between these two is special to the present passage and to Chronicles. <span class="cmt_word">All the priests...  not by course</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all of all the courses, twenty-four in number, instead of only the one course on daily duty at the time (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6-32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-1.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Present</span>; or, <span class="accented">found</span> more literally; that is to say, all who were not for one cause or another out of reach (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-17.htm">1 Chronicles 29:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-25.htm">Ezra 8:25</a>).

So ends our inopportune Authorized Version parenthesis. But to what all this? It is a scene in a nation's history, in the universal Church's history; it is witnessed from heaven, and by Heaven's will recorded in the book on earth, which will endure through all generations, as long as the sun and moon endure, as ushering in the moment when, as described in the next verse, to the unanimous fervent adoration and praise of man, God bent a willing, gracious ear, and to earth the glory of heaven drew nigh. <span class="accented">Cymbals</span>. The word used here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), denoting strictly "pair of cymbals," occurs eleven times in Chronicles, once in Ezra, and once in Nehemiah. Another form of essentially the same word occurs once in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> and twice in <a href="../../par/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>. This last passage notes two kinds of cymbals - the "loud" and the "high-sounding." It was the former of these that Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun used, and their use was probably to regulate or beat the time (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:375, 376; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 167, 2nd edit.). <span class="accented">Psalteries</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>). This word occurs twenty-eight times in the Old Testament, but of these it is translated (Authorized Version) four times as "viols" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>); it is also once rendered "vessels of <span class="accented">flagons"</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a>), but the margin offers the version "instruments of viols." While the cymbal was, of course, an instrument of percussion, the psaltery was one of strings - its use was as an accompaniment to the voice. The first mention of it is very interesting (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). Compare also David's and Solomon's psaltery in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-11.htm">2 Chronicles 9:11</a>. <span class="accented">Harps</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). This word occurs forty-two times, beginning with <a href="../../par/genesis/4-21.htm">Genesis 4:21</a>. <span class="accented">Trumpets</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). This word (including eleven of the personal forms of it, as e.g. the person <span class="accented">blowing the trumpet</span>) occurs just forty times, beginning with <a href="../../par/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>. It was the straight <span class="accented">tuba</span>, and was not, therefore, the same with the ram's-horn shaped <span class="accented">buccina</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>), generally rendered in the Authorized Version "cornet," but sometimes "trumpet;" the specialty of the cornet being to blow a sound for a signal or summons of some sort, whether secular as in war, or sacred as for some festival. The <span class="accented">trumpets</span> of our verse evidently (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8</a>) were in a particular sense the instrument of the priests. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers <i>were</i> as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up <i>their</i> voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, <i>saying</i>, For <i>he is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever: that <i>then</i> the house was filled with a cloud, <i>even</i> the house of the LORD;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - It cannot but be that it was intended in this verse that attention should be rivetted to the fact of the splendid consentaneity of all singers and all musicians, of hearts and voices and instruments.
