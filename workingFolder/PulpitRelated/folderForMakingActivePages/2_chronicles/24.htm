The references <a href="../../par/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> and Amos 8:14 may possibly contain the clue, in holding up Beersheba as the most idolatrous of idolatrous places. Beersheba offers another reference of unhappy associations (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-2.htm">1 Samuel 8:2</a>).

The references <a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a> and Genesis 26:18, 31-33 are full of interest, as bearing on the way in which the spot is first known in Bible history.

Our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a> leaves it probable that "Jehoaden of Jerusalem" was one of these, though it is likely enough that Joash married, whether her or some one else, <span class="accented">before</span> he had reached the age of twenty-one. It is also quite likely that we may read between the lines, that in selecting <span class="accented">two</span> wives for his young and loved ward, Jehoiada hoped and prayed that Joash might not fall by sin like Solomon's (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>) and that of others of the kings of both Judah and Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass after this, <i>that</i> Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To repair</span>.

The compound adverbial expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, here used for "from," era-braces the idea of" unfailingly from year to year." The command given here to the priests and Levites is expressed very differently, though in no degree contadictorily, in the parallel (see its vers. 4, 5). The addition is there found, "every man of his acquaintance;" this expression may glance at the very supposable circumstance that the priest and Levite collecting deputations would naturally go respectively to the towns and cities where they had been located beforetime. A slight ambiguity is perhaps occasioned by the impression that the fourth verse (in the parallel) produces - that the priests and Levites should wait to <span class="accented">receive, e.g.</span>, in Jerusalem. This, however, is sot what is <span class="accented">said</span>, and need not, therefore, be made into a difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the Levites hastened not.</span> We are not told <span class="accented">why</span> this delay was, nor does the subsequent narrative seem to elucidate it, further than this - that the delay somehow seemed to rest with Jehoiada, as the king appealed to him for explanation.

In each of those instances the Hebrew text shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and the Authorized Version "chief" except inconsistently in our ver. 11. Revised Version "chief" in all the instances. The name "priest" occurs just about six hundred and sixty-six times in the Old Testament, the title "high" or "chief priest" only about twenty-six times, the first occurrence being in <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, the last <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>; and both set forth by the Hebrew adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, as also in fifteen other of the occurrences. Seven times the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is the word employed, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>the other two times. In these last two cases, however (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-24.htm">Ezra 8:24, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>), it is not "high priests" nor "chief priests" that are perhaps even really intended, but the "princes" of the priests, or those who, for whatever reasons of personal characteristics, were <span class="accented">chief. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Out of Judah and out of Jerusalem</span>. The statement here is precise, that the call of money was to be made both in the cities of Judah and in the metropolis Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">collection</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; Revised Version, better, <span class="accented">the tax of, etc.</span> Of this we read in <a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/1-30.htm">Numbers 1:30</a>.

This source of money for the holy design of Joash is again most specifically stated in our ver. 9. The version of this whole transaction seems rather confusing as given in the parallel, where ver. 4 mentions three sources of money, without any quotation as such of the ordained tax of Moses, which was apparently the first of those three, and where ver. 8, at first blush at any rate, might seem to imply <span class="accented">recusant</span> priests. The meaning, however, is probably the contrary, the verse purporting that the priests consented to forego what they had been accustomed on receiving to apply to some personal or current-funds purpose, and who consented to forego the superintending of the outlay of the money on. the repairing, that it might be done with more expedition by "scribe" and high priest" (ver. 10; comp. ver. 16; both of the parallel). All these details the writer of Chronicles passes over, only pursuing the essential business, Joash's pious resolve, the delay in its execution, and how he finally overcame the obstructive delay.

At the same time, the clause, occupying only one word in the original, may quite possibly purport to state summarily by anticipation that the same system was observed to the end, and the method of the chest not departed from. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-11.htm">2 Chronicles 24:11</a></div><div class="verse">Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that <i>there was</i> much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again.

The change of the number of the verb in "they emptied," etc., and the apparent statement that those who <span class="accented">emptied</span> also <span class="accented">carried back</span> the chest, betoken that while <span class="cmt_word">the king's</span> <span class="cmt_word">scribe</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and the high priest's officer</span> stood by, the usual Levite functionaries did the work.

We seem to know too little of him, and the parallel supplies considerably less than our text in Chronicles. His age, as stated in this verse when he died, seems very improbable, and for a very clear and admirable putting of the case, see Lord Arthur C. Hervey's article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:944. There is, however, no manifest or even suspicious symptom of corruptness in the text just here, supported as it is by the Septuagint and Josephus, by the stress laid on his old age, whether it showed a hundred and thirty years, or thirty years or fifty years (as have been variously suggested) fewer; the little fact, otherwise looking very significant, that the expression, <span class="cmt_word">full of days</span>, is used beside only of Abraham, Isaac, Job, and <span class="accented">David</span>, loses its pertinence in that very circumstance that it <span class="accented">is</span> used of David, whose age was in no way extreme.

His royal alliance with Jeheram's daughter, and, if it were so, his extreme patriarchal age, may all have contributed to the honour now put upon him. Little stress can be laid, however, upon this last consideration, failing any other allusion to it, or any emphasized statement of what we have in our ver. 15. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17</a></div><div class="verse">Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes</span>. These turned aside from the better part they had performed (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-13.htm">2 Chronicles 23:13, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Made obeisance</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. This is the word that is used of the sheaves of the brethren of Joseph bowing down, according to his dream, to his sheaf; it is also the repeatedly used word of the worship paid to Jehovah the true God, and to idols and false gods. The word occurs nearly two hundred times. The <span class="accented">obeisance</span> of these princes, therefore, on this occasion lacked nothing of the most pronounced character, and the worst species of flattery gained its disastrous ends. Joash must have been now about thirty-six years of age; he was seven years old when he began to reign, he had reigned twenty-three years before the restoring of the temple (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-6.htm">2 Kings 12:6</a>), and a few years had elapsed since. The words of the princes, to which Joash <span class="cmt_word">hearkened</span>, are not supplied by the parallel, which indeed at once proceeds to speak of the threatening attitude of the Syrian king Hazael, and of how Joash bought him off. Our next verse, however, shows to what end those words tended. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-18.htm">2 Chronicles 24:18</a></div><div class="verse">And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Served groves</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the Asherim</span>, correctly (see note, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For this their trespass</span>. Comparing the emphatic language of ver. 23," destroyed all the princes of the people <span class="accented">from among the people</span>," we may conclude that stress is to be laid on the pronoun "their" in the present verse. The worship of the true God was not left by the whole people, and we are not told it was by the king; but (very probably through want of moral courage) he incurred the severest sort of blame, and was without even the excuse of strong personal temptation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19</a></div><div class="verse">Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophets</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a></div><div class="verse">And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came upon</span>; margin, <span class="accented">clothed</span>; Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">clothed itself with</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>).

The Hebrew text says, "and ye will not prosper." This clause may read all the more forcibly if kept under the dominance of the <span class="cmt_word">why</span> of the former, reminding us of such appeals as "Why will ye die?" etc. (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>, throughout). Reading these two clauses in the preterite or present tense will make them neither less forcible nor less correct, so indicating that they, the princes and the nation, were already beginning to eat the fruit of their ways, and "rumours of war," if not war itself, were on them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-21.htm">2 Chronicles 24:21</a></div><div class="verse">And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stoned him</span>.

So, too, the Revised Version, which also, according to its custom, removes the italic type from the two neuter pronouns "it." But probabaly a better and correcter rendering is, "The Lord will see and will require" (for it is not necessary to regard  this as a prayer of Zechariah); and thus bring it into comparison with those divinest prayers of the Saviour and of St. Stephen. The words on dying Zechariah's lips were perhaps rather the vivid reminiscence of his own well-versed knowledge of the Law, or "the Scriptures" (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>). The sentence of the dying priest and prophet in one, is, by the writer of Chronicles at any rate, directed in its fall with fearful straightness to the door of <span class="cmt_word">Joash the king</span> himself. Remarkable as is the absence of the matter of this and the five preceding verses from the parallel, it will not escape notice how it is implied in vers. 17,18 there, while the <span class="accented">inclusion</span> of it here is again in patent harmony with the great object of the writer.

The versions, of course, express correctly what is meant, but probably the season of spring is also conveyed (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-1.htm">1 Chronicles 20:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host of Syria</span>. Their king was Hazael (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17</a>), whether actually with them is perhaps not certain, but the last clause in the verse just quoted would seem to convey that impression. He was King of <span class="accented">Damascus</span> (Aram, or Syria), and having already temporarily mastered Israel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3, 4, 22</a>), the way was paved to Gath (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>), whence wistful eyes were bent on Jerusalem, nearly thirty miles distant thence. <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed all the princes of the people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">And sent all the spoil</span>. Whether intended so here or not, probably the strict subject of the verb in this clause is Joash and his counsellors (ver. 18 in parallel), in their fright - and just fright - helpless after the slaughter chronicled in our following verse, bribing off Hazael and his host, as in parallel. The suggestion is most plausible that tidings of Zechariah's martyrdom and of the occasion of it were the very incentive to Hazael's incursion, and an illustration of the "means" by which God works, and by which he wrought his purpose in this instance. <span class="cmt_word">The spoil of them</span>. If this means only the spoil of the defeated army strictly, then our text gives no trace of the contents of ver. 18 in parallel just alluded to; but the frequent dislocation incident to copied extracts and matter borrowed from original sources, and so often evidenced in the present history, when we have been comparing the two derived accounts to which we are indebted for it, incline us to the above view, as one quite open at any rate to possibility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-24.htm">2 Chronicles 24:24</a></div><div class="verse">For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

The Hebrew says literally, "and on Joash they executed judgments." What the judgments were we do not read, but surely it is probable that they are glanced at in the next verse, "For they left him in great [or, 'many'] diseases," or perhaps "in great illness" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-15.htm">2 Chronicles 21:15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They left him in great diseases</span>. See note above, and observe further that this parenthetic clause, as treated in both Authorized Version and Revised Version, prepares the way for what follows, and especially for the fact that it was <span class="cmt_word">on his bed that they slew him</span>. Render thus, <span class="accented">And after they had betaken themselves away, whereas they left him sorely ill, his own servants conspired</span>...  <span class="accented">and slew him in his</span> bed. <span class="cmt_word">His own servants</span>. These had the opportunity the rather at hand, in that he was so ill and in bed. That he died by the conspiring together of a couple of servants, whose foreign and heathen maternity is particularly recorded, was the more ignominious end for him, who had commanded Zechariah to be openly stoned - a death highly honourable in comparison. The parallel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>) adds that it was in "the house of Mille, which goeth down to Silla" (for the explanation of which passage, see note <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>), that the servants' conspiracy to kill Joash took effect. The sons of Jehoiada. We know of only one son, Zechariah; there may have been other sons, or other lineal relations of Jehoiada may be covered by the word "sons." We are not obliged to interpret the avenging act of the servants as one to which their own pious and patriotic zeal led them, which, considering their maternal pedigree, is perhaps something unlikely, though of course not impossible, but one to which they were incited by the retributive providence of him who held their hearts also in his hand. In a word, it was a deed done for the <span class="accented">bleed - required</span> (see note and references under ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">Not in the sepulchres of the kings</span>. See note on ver. 16, and references there quoted; as also the ambiguous expression of the parallel (ver. 21), "They <span class="accented">buried him with his fathers in</span> the city of David."

The word rendered "story" or "commentary" in our text is employed only once beside (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>). Its verbal root, however, is found about a hundred and sixty-two times, invariably in the sense of inquiring, and almost invariably rendered in the Authorized Version by the word "inquire," or "seek;" so that perhaps the word "study" or "pursuit" might, idioms being allowed for, be the nearer rendering. It is rabbinic literature mostly that has determined the preference for the word "commentary." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_chronicles/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Chronicles 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
