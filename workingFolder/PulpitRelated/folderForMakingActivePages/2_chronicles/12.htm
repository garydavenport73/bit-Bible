When we turn to the fuller statements of the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>), we see that the sins that were at work were not those of king merely, but of people, especially in abominations such as those of sodomy and the immoral practices of the "groves," as well as the ecclesiastical and irreligious iniquities of "high places" and "image" worship!

To him Jeroboam had fled for refuge from Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). He reigned An. Sac. 3830 ( <span class="date">B.C. 980</span>) to 3851 or 3863. This makes Solomon's reign A.S. 3799 ( <span class="date">B.C. 1011</span>) to 3839 ( <span class="date">B.C. 971</span>). Shishak's invasion, therefore, in aid of Jeroboam, was A.S. 3844 ( <span class="date">B.C. 966</span>). A representation of it exists in relief sculptured on the south external wall of the temple of Amen, at Karnak, Thebes; and, together with this, an elaborate list of countries, cities, tribes, conquered by Sheshenk or tributary to him, a hundred and thirty-three in number. Among these are some of the very fifteen fenced cities (see our ver. 4) which Rehoboam built or fortified, viz. the three, Shoco, Adoraim, and Aijalon, while the erasure of fourteen names just where these are found accounts, no doubt, for the non-appearance of others of them. There are also the names of Levitical and Canaanite cities, situated in the kingdoms of the ten tribes, but belonging to the Levites who had been compelled to migrate into Judah. The dates given above are those accepted by Conder, in his 'Handbook to the Bible' (see pp. 28-34), and do not quite agree with those adopted in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1287-1294. Both of these most interesting articles will well repay perusal, as well as the article "Thebes" in the latter work, 3:1471-1475. (The name and word <span class="accented">Shishak</span> has no relation whatever with the <span class="accented">Sheshach</span> of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>; It. 41, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, a word which, possibly spelling <span class="accented">Babel</span> or even <span class="accented">Ur</span>, marks the name of a place, and is evidently used by Jeremiah for Babylon or Babylonia.)

They are not mentioned elsewhere so as to be recognized. <span class="cmt_word">Ethiopians</span>. These were ethnically Cushites, but the territorial application of the term was confined to the African Cushite settlers. It is remarkable that, in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, Ethiopians are classed with Arabians, but otherwise with African peoples, and in particular Egypt (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). They were many-tribed, and the Sabaeans were a leading tribe of them. It is evident that Shishak could draw from a large and varied dominion subject to his dynasty at this time.

But see next note, and the" altogether" of ver. 12. It has often been most justly remarked what grateful note should be taken of the fact that God always is recorded as turning such a wistful, loving eye to any symptom of repentance (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27-29</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5-9</a>).

The contrast of God's service and that of men and the world again touchingly recalls the words of Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).

Possibly, considering the words of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12, 17</a>, this may indicate that Rehoboam was brought down to thinking almost more of the safety of Jerusalem and himself than of the kingdom in its length and breadth. <span class="cmt_word">One and forty years old</span> (see our note, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a>, towards the end, and compare our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, as well as the parallel places, <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a> and 1 Kings 14:21). It cannot be held as conclusively shown that the age of forty-one is incorrect. <span class="cmt_word">An Ammonitess</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-9</a>). Rehoboam's mother's name and nationality are noted also, and twice in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21, 31</a>). Naamah was possibly the daughter of Nahash (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-1.htm">1 Chronicles 19:1-20:3</a>). The briefness but decidedness of the notifications made as to this mother of Rehoboam leaves us without doubt that there is not lacking significance in them. Schulz (in his ' Scholia in Ver. Test.,' vol. 3.) says the reason is "quia ca filio idololatriae ansam dedisse videtur;" Keil and Bertheau think that, though there was evidence of this in the case of the mention of Asa's mother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), the explanation here is that Naamah "appears" to have had, as queen-mother, considerable influence in the government. They do not specify where they find this to "appear" with any marked plainness. It is quite true that, in the successive accounts of the Jewish kings, the name of each mother is mentioned (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-32.htm">2 Chronicles 20:32</a>, etc.). We should say it is like the book, so Divine and human, called the Bible, to do so far-seeing and far-reaching a thing as to give the mother's name; and practically to say that Solomon and Naamah were (in special sense for Judah) a repetition of Adam and Eve. How far Judah and her line of kings may have correctly said, <span class="accented">they</span> were answerable for "death and all our woe," the sacred historians say (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4, 9-11, 14, 23, 26, 31, 33, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-24.htm">1 Kings 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-4.htm">2 Chronicles 11:4</a>).

The authorities quoted here are the works of Shemaiah and of Iddo, and it is possible that the following words touching the continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam, which have not the substantive verb among them, may have been part of the title of Iddo's work, although it is more probable that his work on 'Genealogies' would retain the character of a specialty. We subjoin for English readers a literal translation of this verse: "And the words (acts) of Jeroboam first and last, are they not written in the words (acts) of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer touching genealogies" [but Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>," in the manner of a genealogical table"] "and wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam perpetual."
