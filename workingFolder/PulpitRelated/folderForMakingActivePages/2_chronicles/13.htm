The different alphabetic characters may be attributed to error, and that error the error of transcription merely. As in our note (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), the word "daughter," as in many similar cases, stands for granddaughter. Thus the father of Maachah was Uriel of Gibeah, and her mother Tamar, daughter of Absalom. Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:10. &sect; 1) proffers us this connecting link of explanation. On the other hand, Rabbi Joseph's Targum on Chronicles says that Uriel means Absalom, but was a name used to avoid the use of Absalom. We have no clue as to which out of many Gibeahs is here intended. The Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>) signifies a hill with round top, and hence would easily give name to many places.

Josephus ('Bell, Jud.,' 5:2. &sect; 1) states what helps to the identifying of the place as the modern <span class="accented">Tuleil-el-ful</span>, about thirty stadia from Jerusalem (see also <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>).

It would be, however, a great relief to faith to be able to <span class="accented">give proof</span> that this treatment would be true to fact. At present the numbers can be shown to be consistent with other numbers, such as those of the entire man-population (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-17</a>); and this seems the best that can be said in support of them. It does not, however, suffice to bring comfortable conviction. It is remarkable, among the difficulties that the question entails, that we do not get any satisfactory explanation as to how such vast numbers of slain bodies were <span class="accented">disposed</span> of in a compass of ground comparatively so small. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which <i>is</i> in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mount Zemaraim</span>. This <span class="accented">mount</span> is not mentioned elsewhere. Presumably it was a mountain or hill above the place called Zemaraim, mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a> as in Benjamin's allotment, and mentioned between the places called Beth ha-Arabah (<span class="accented">i.e. the</span> Jordan valley) and Bethel. Accordingly, it may be that <span class="accented">itself</span> lay between these two, or near enough to them one or both.

It is said to be in <span class="cmt_word">Mount Ephraim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the range of Mount Ephraim, which was one of considerable length, running through the midst of what was afterwards called Samaria, from the Plain of Esdraelon to Judah. Zemaraim may be so named from the Zemarite tribe, who were Hamites, and related to the Hittites and Amorites (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-16.htm">1 Chronicles 1:16</a>), descendants of Canaan; there are some faint traces of their having wandered from their northern settlements into mid and south Palestine.

While, however, he preaches well to others, there are not wanting signs that he can blind himself as to some failure of practice on his own part. The points of the argument running through his harangue are correct, skilfully chosen, and well and religiously thrust home on the heart of his supposed audience. The practical trust of himself and his army are testified to in vers. 14, 15, and abundantly rewarded. This sequel-practical trust is the best credential of the sincerity of his foregoing appeal and harangue. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gave the kingdom...  to David for ever</span>. With the thrice-repeated "for ever" of what we call <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>, and the very emphatic language of the fifteenth verse in that passage, in the memory of Abijah, no one can say he was not justified by the letter and to the letter in what he now says. At the same time, how is it that Abijah does not in all fairness quote the matter of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-16.htm">2 Chronicles 6:16</a> <span class="accented">last</span> clause, and of its parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a> last clause, and of <a href="../../par/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28-37</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a>? <span class="cmt_word">Covenant of salt</span> (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-24.htm">Ezekiel 43:24</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>). The use of salt was ordered first for the meal offerings, which, consisting mainly of flour, did not need it as an antiseptic; afterwards it was ordered for "all" offerings, including the "burnt offering:" as surely as leaven was proscribed, salt was prescribed (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>). "The covenant of salt" meant the imperish-ableness and irrevocableness of the engagement made between the two parties to the covenant The widespread and deeply significant use of it among other and heathen nations is remarkable indeed, and is attested by Pliny ('Hist. Natal 31:41) in forcible words: "Nulla (sacra) conficiuntur sine mola salsa" (Her., 2 Sat. 3:200; Virgil, 'AEn.,' 2:133; Hom., ' Iliad,' 1:449). Some think it a sufficient explanation of the text, "covenant of salt," that, especially in the East, solemn engagements and vows were often recognized and strengthened by hospitalities<span class="cmt_word">,</span> as shown to guests, and of these salt was an indispensable element. It is true that some of the ancient indications and descriptions of friendship and close friendships turned on phrases (similar ones, indeed, still existing) into which the word "salt" entered, but that these phrases arose from the fact that salt was so general a constituent of human food seems insufficient explanation, where we can find one of a more direct and more directly religious, or, as the case might be (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> with heathen sacrifices), superstitious birth. Religion and superstition between them have been the most world-wide, incalculable, and untraceable originators and disseminators of half the possible phrases of human language!

This word, and one very slightly different in form, and their adverb, occur in all forty-one times; rendered in the Authorized Version "empty" nineteen times, "vain" eighteen times, and "without cause," "to no purpose," and "void" the remaining four times. It is the word that is used of the "empty" pit of Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>); of the "empty ears" of corn (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>); of "empty" pitchers and other vessels (<a href="../../par/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a>).

This word is found twenty-seven times, and, including seven marginal options, is rendered in the Authorized Version "Belial" twenty-three times; the four exceptions being "wicked" three times, and "naughty" once. The derivation of it marks the one expressive meaning of "without profit." <span class="cmt_word">Young and tender-hearted</span>.

However, whether "slain" or "wounded and slain," the alleged, numbers of our present text are, in our opinion, incredibly enormous.

A place not known elsewhere in Scripture by this name, which by derivation means "old." Grove (Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 1035) quotes Josephus ('Ant.,' 14:15.&sect; 12) as speaking of a place so named, the scene of a battle between Herod and Antigonus's general, Pappus, but Josephus does not assign its site. <span class="cmt_word">Ephrain</span>; or, according to Chethiv, <span class="accented">Epron.</span> Grove (Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 569) says that conjecture has identified it with the <span class="accented">Ephraim</span> of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a>, with the <span class="accented">Ophrah</span> of <a href="../../par/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>, and with the Ephraim of <a href="../../par/john/11-54.htm">John 11:54</a>; possibly the modern <span class="accented">El-Taiyibeh</span> (Dr. Robinson, 1:44), about five miles from Bethel.

The writer of Chronicles here, for brevity's sake, and not to recur to his name again, records the death of Jeroboam, which, however, did not happen till after Abijah's death, in the second year of Asa's reign (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-20.htm">1 Kings 14:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25</a>).
