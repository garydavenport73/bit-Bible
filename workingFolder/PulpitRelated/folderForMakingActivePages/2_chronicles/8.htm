Four years of Solomon had passed when he began the Lord's house, seven were spent in building it, thirteen in finishing and furnishing it, and in building, finishing, and furnishing the king's house - in all twenty-four years. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cities which Huram had restored to Solomon</span>. <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> explains the force of the word "restored" here, telling how it was Hiram had come by "twenty cities in the land of Galilee" by way of payment, or part payment, for the "cedar," "fir," and "gold" which he had given Solomon. It is evident that these cities were in need of repair; possibly they had not been previously in the occupation of the Israelites; if they had been, the transaction was scarcely legitimate on the part of Solomon (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-12.htm">Leviticus 25:12-33</a>), and we may suppose they had become largely deserted when made over to Hiram. It would not, however, be necessary to suppose either that Solomon had given them because they were poor property in his eyes, or that Hiram, whose good will and generous disposition are elsewhere specially notified, had returned them as a thankless gift or as a bad payment, but for the language of vers. 12, 13 (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9.htm">1 Kings 9</a>.), which distinctly tells us that when Hiram inspected them they did "not please him," and that he named them "the land of Oabul" (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 237). The probability is that, as cities on the borderland, they were what had been at present unoccupied by Israelites, were all the likelier in bad repair, and, unvalued by Hiram, were, when put into good repair by Solomon, such that Solomon might justly <span class="cmt_word">cause the children of Israel to dwell</span> in them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hamath-zobah</span>. Hamath (when the name occurs separately) was a place both of great geographical note (occupying, whether regarded as a larger region or a town, an important position in the northern end of that broad valley of Coele-Syria which separates Lebanon and Antilebanon, and through which passed the river Orontes) and of great historical note from the time of the Exodus to that of Amos. The town, or city, is to be understood to be the Great Hamath (<a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>). But the kingdom, or district, or county, was almost conterminous with Coele-Syria. Zobah, also a portion of Syria, amounted to a small kingdom, and is read of alike in Saul's and in David's times, as in Solomon's time. It probably lay to the north-east of Hamath (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8, 7, 8, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-9.htm">2 Samuel 10:9, 16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-16.htm">1 Chronicles 19:16</a>). But Hamath-zobah of this verse was probably a place called Hamath, in the region of Zobah, in which also two other cities are mentioned, Berothai and Tibhath, or Betah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a>). These two kingdoms of Hamath and Zobah, contiguous as they were, seem as though they purposed to compliment one another - Zobah by naming one of its towns Hamath, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span> It is said that the Assyrian inscriptions show that they remained, after Solomon, distinct kingdoms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tadmor in the wilderness</span>. Tadmor, one with the classical Palmyra, lay in the desert of Syria, about half-way between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates, and distant from Damascus about a hundred and <span class="accented">forty</span> miles to its east-north-east. Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 8, note 1) says, "Is it quite certain that 'Tadmor' and 'Palmyra' are words derived from the (palms)? A palm is in Hebrew <span class="accented">tamar</span>...  and in Greek...  <span class="accented">phoenix."</span> Solomon was probably not the originator, but rather re-builder, of the place. Its fame was great under Zenobia, the Queen of Odenathus; she was taken captive by the Emperor Aurelian, A.D. 273, when the city was subdued. It is now little better than the haunt of a few Arabs Splendid ruins remain, specially of the great temple of the sun. The Hebrew text of <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> has apparently <span class="accented">Tamer</span>, or <span class="accented">Tamar</span>, and it has been suggested by Movers on that passage that possibly a Tamar in the south, and that is found in the neighbourhood of some of the other places, such as Baalath, Beth-heron, and Gezer, all in the south (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>; ch. 20:2), is intended. Our text, however, in the present place offers no choice, while that in Kings (compare Chethiv and Keri) is doubtful. And finally, our writer is <span class="accented">here</span> evidently in the neighbourhood of Hamath, which of course best suits Tadmor. Although there is an apparent disjointedness between this and the parallel, closer notice may rather bring confirmation of substantial agreement between them. For instance, the <span class="cmt_word">store cities</span> here spoken of as belonging to Hamath (but not individually named here and not corresponding with those that <span class="accented">are</span> named in Kings) are accounted for by the words, "and in Lebanon," in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beth-heron the upper... Beth-heron the nether</span>. The parallel mentions only the latter (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-17.htm">1 Kings 9:17</a>). They were both in Ephraim (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-24.htm">1 Chronicles 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13, 14</a>), but were assigned to the Kohathite Levites (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-22.htm">Joshua 21:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-68.htm">1 Chronicles 6:68</a>). The name means "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">hollow</span> place." The upper Beth-heron was about four miles from Gibeon, and the lower about three miles further on. The Roman general Cestius Gallus was defeated here in the last Jewish war; Judas Maccabaeus conquered here (1 Maccabees 3:18-25). Other interesting references may be made to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-18.htm">1 Samuel 13:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-7.htm">1 Kings 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-18.htm">2 Chronicles 25:18</a>.

In the parallel some of the names of the places built, or rebuilt, or repaired by Solomon in this connection are given as "Mille and the wall of Jerusalem" (Millo's foundations occupied the hollow at the south-west corner of the hill of the temple), "and Hazer and Megiddo and Gezer" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All that Solomen desired to build</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for purposes of personal enjoyment or ornament.

The parallel charitably "whom the children of Israel were not able to destroy utterly," where our text shows with exacter fidelity, <span class="cmt_word">whom the children of Israel consumed not</span>. The parallel also uses the words, "levy a tribute of <span class="accented">bond</span>-<span class="accented">service</span>," for our more ambiguous <span class="cmt_word">make to pay tribute</span> (<a href="../../par/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-7</a>). In the words, <span class="cmt_word">until this day</span>, the copyist, shall we say, too slavish, is again detected (ver. 9). The "levy "in <span class="accented">ver.</span> 21 of the parallel probably explains the suddenly mentioned similar language of its fifteenth verse, and again betrays the collected and copied nature of the historic material, the carefulness of sequence not being as observable in selection as might be desired. The distinction between the remnant of aliens and the people of Israel was manifestly that the <span class="accented">menial</span> and the laborious service was put on the former. Useful but familiar references to this whole subject are found in <a href="../../par/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21-36</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>. For our <span class="cmt_word">two hundred and fifty</span> (which gives the number of overseers over Israelites only) the parallel reads, "five hundred and fifty." It will be remembered that an analogous difference occurs between our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a> and <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a>. Whether it were the determining reason or not in these two places, it is very imaginable that it would be of less importance in the ages of the post-Captivity annalist to dwell on the minutiae of the different treatment of the aliens.
