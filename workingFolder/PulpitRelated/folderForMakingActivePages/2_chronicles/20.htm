The familiar Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) is expressive of the quick, tripping step of the young and of women.

The passage, <a href="../../par/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13</a>, Authorized Version "before the sun was up," Revised Version "from the ascent of Heres," possibly designates <span class="accented">a rising ground</span>, named . 'the Ascent of the Sun<span class="accented"></span>," or, "of Heres." The following extract from Keil, with its quotations from Robinson, is interesting. "The wilderness Jezreel was without doubt the name of a part of the great stretch of fiat country bounded on the south by the Waddy El Ghar, and extending from the Dead Sea to the neighbourhood of Tekoa, which is now called <span class="accented">El</span> <span class="accented">Hassasah</span>, after a waddy on its northern side. The whole country on the west side of the Dead Sea," where it does not consist of mountain ridges or deep valleys, is high table-land sloping gradually towards the east, wholly waste, merely covered here and there by a few bushes and without the slightest trace of having ever been cultivated' (Robinson's 'Palest.,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>). Our present ascent of Ziz, or Hazziz, has perhaps remained in the Waddy El Hassasah Robinson takes it to be the pass, which at present leads from Ain-jiddy to the table-land. Yet it is described by him as a 'fearful pass,' and it can hardly be thought of here even if the enemy like the Bedouins, now when on their forays, may be supposed to have marched along the shore of the sea, and ascended to the tableland only at Engedi; for the Israelites did not meet the enemy in this ascent, but <span class="accented">above</span> upon the table-land." Josephus translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, but with no legitimate justification. <span class="cmt_word">The end of the brook</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rather the end of the brook-way, or course of the brook when there was water to make one.

It is, however, a word of very generic quality, and is rendered as here "jewels" about twenty-five other times. It would seem nugatory to tell us that there were "dead bodies," in the bald rendering of "and dead bodies." Our Authorized Version rendering, "riches <span class="accented">with</span> the dead bodies," of course both ingeniously glosses the difficulty and makes a sufficiently good meaning.

The parallel has, "in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah." For our "mentioned," note margin, literal, made to ascend and Revised Version "inserted." The "book of the kings of Israel" may (note also the remarkable apparent misnomers of our writer, as illustrated by <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-6.htm">2 Chronicles 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2, 4</a>) very possibly be one with the parallel, "book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah" (see our 'Introduction,' 1 Chronicles, pp. 7, 8.). Of this larger collected cyclopaedia of royal biography, Jehu's account (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) of Jehoshaphat was one component part.

The historical episode of these three verses (35-37) is evidently misplaced. As Ahaziah succeeded his father Ahab in Jehoshaphat's seventeenth year, we of course are at no loss to fix the time of Jehoshaphat's "joining himself with Ahaziah." He had "joined himself" with Ahab, and had smarted for it, and yet "after" that, he "joined himself" with his son Ahaziah. We do not doubt that the "who" of this verse refers to Ahaziah, not, as some think, to Jehoshaphat. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a></div><div class="verse">And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - This verse tells us the object with which Jehoshaphat had joined himself with Ahaziah, and <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a> tells <span class="cmt_word">us</span> how at last, by a point-blank refusal to Ahaziah, he withdrew from the very brief commercial alliance after he had not merely been witnessed against by the Prophet Eliezer spoken of in our next verse, but more decisively witnessed against by the shattering of his ships. To <span class="cmt_word">go to Tarshish</span>. This clause, even if the text is not corrupt, yet cannot mean what it <span class="accented">seems</span> to say; but in the word "to go" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>) must mean, of the sort that were wont to go to Tarshish, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that were used for the Tarshish trade. We are guided to some such explanation by <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>, where it is said the ships were "ships <span class="accented">of</span> Tarshish to go to <span class="accented">Ophir"</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>). That the ships could not be to go to Tarshish is plain from the fact of the place, Ezion-geber (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-17.htm">2 Chronicles 8:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), on the Red Sea, where they were built. Some, however, have suggested that some other Tarshish (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the Gulf of Persia)than that of Spain (<span class="accented">Tartessus</span>) may conceivably be meant. The clear statement of the parallel saves the necessity of any such supposition, however.
