Some have sought to bring into the appearance of harmony the two first clauses of this verse by supposing that the former clause purports to say that Hezekiah sent messengers to all Israel and Judah, and in particular letters in addition to Ephraim and Manasseh, the chief tribes of the northern kingdom and the Joseph tribes. Vers. 6 and 10, however, seem to dispose effectually of this offer of explanation; while another explanation, that the names of the two tribes are simply to be taken as equivalent to "all Israel," seems true, though, in fact, it may be to advance us no way at all. We should prefer in the difficulty, unimportant though it is, yet one facing us, rather to assume that the verse wishes to say that Hezekiah <span class="accented">sent</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> sent messengers, which prove to be the <span class="accented">runners</span>, rendered the "posts") to all Israel and Judah, and to Ephraim, Manasseh, and the rest of their allied tribes by implication, but not to Judah wrote letters also which were carried by the posts (.or runners). It is true that ver. 6 may negative even this conjecture for getting over the difficulty, but <span class="accented">not</span> necessarily no, for it only says that the posts went throughout Israel and Judah with the letters, which they may be supposed to have dropped only to some, not to all, and those some <span class="accented">Israel</span>, or Ephraim, Manasseh, and brethren. There will have been to hand other, the usual methods of communication with Judah, from Jerusalem its metropolis, and from its king. The thing <span class="accented">different from</span> "letters" that was circulated may have been just the "proclamation" of ver. 5. It has been suggested that the now King of Israel, Hoshea, was very probably a captive of Assyria at this exact time (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>).

The translation should read, <span class="accented">for they had not kept it in multitude, i.e.</span> in proper multitudes, and in the multitude of an undivided and holy kingdom. The force of the reference lies in the fact just stated, that Hezekiah, ignoring all the worse precedents of now many generations, and ignoring the iniquity of the duality of the kingdom, manfully caused his writ to run from south to north unchecked! <span class="cmt_word">As it was written</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the book of the Law of Moses.

Hezekiah had, no doubt, already made his account with the fact that the injured and crushed state of the northern kingdom might be of salutary omen for the attempt on his part to bring them to a sense of their past sins, specially perhaps of omission. Of the calamities of Israel, and their captivity in large part, and in the rest subjection by tribute to Assyria, there is clear testimony in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-1.htm">2 Kings 17:1-6</a>.

The way in which the names of these two tribes are here used may explain in part the use of them in brief for simple reasons of the convenience of brevity in ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">They laughed them to scorn, and mocked them</span>. These two words speak significant description of the exact moral state in which Israel's tribes were now to be found. <span class="cmt_word">Even unto Zebulun</span>. What of the country lay north of Zebulun had been so wasted by Assyria that practically Zebulnn is spoken of as what was most northerly.

The probable significance of the passage is not to lay stress upon the tribes represented, but on the scattered, though sparse, attendants at the Passover who came.

Considering the difference of preposition, this expression can perhaps scarcely cite as its parallel <a href="../../par/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>. "The hand of God" here means rather his effectual working, which effectual working produced a hearty unanimity, that contrasted well with the bearing of the northern tribes.
