The form of expression may indicate the hearty zeal of the nation for this chosen son of Josiah, who seems to have been not the eldest.

The name is the same with <span class="accented">Nabokodrosoros</span>, is written in the Assyrian monuments <span class="accented">Nebu-kuduri-utzur</span>, and meaning, "Nebo (<a href="../../par/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), protector from ill," or "protects the crown." In Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>) we have the name written Nebuchadrezzar, as also in Ezekiel. Nebuchadnezzar, second King of Babylon, was the son of Nabopolassar, who took Nineveh  <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>, and reigned above forty years. Though we are here told he bound Jehoiakim in chains, to take him to Babylon, for some reason or other he did not carry out this intention, and Jehoiakim was put to death at Jerusalem (Jeremiah 12:18, 19; Jeremiah 36:30; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-8.htm">Ezekiel 19:8, 9</a>). The expedition of Nebuchadnezzar was  <span class="date">B.C. 605-4</span> (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a>), and <span class="accented">during</span> it, his father dying, he succeeded to the throne.

Compare particularly with this verse the parallel in its vers. 10-16. <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah his brother</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not adopting the very generic usage of the terms of relationship, so common in Old Testament language, his <span class="accented">uncle</span>. His mother (<span class="accented">Hamutal, ver.</span> 18 of parallel) was the same with the mother of Jehoahaz. Ten years old evidently when Jehoiakim began his reign, he must have been thirteen years younger than his whole brother Je-hoahaz. Zedekiah's name was before Mat-taniah. The account of Zedekiah in the parallel (which see) is very much more full.

A period of half a century has elapsed between the latest date of the foregoing verses (circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>) and the date signalized here (circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 5</span>.38-6). With the proclamation of <span class="accented">Cyrus</span> begins in fact the manhood, with all its mystic, its wonderful, and its still non-progressing struggles, of the Jew. His simple childhood, wilful youth, am indeed for ever gone. But he and his nation are with unspeakably painful travail born. No life of nation that is or ever has been merits the devout observation and study that this unchal-lengeably does. Our present verse and the one succeeding it are, sentence for sentence, the same with the opening verses of the Book of Ezra, which may possibly once have joined on to Chronicles, as one work, though we think this exceedingly unlikely. Cyrus (the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> of the Hebrew text) was the son of a royal Persian, Cambysses; his mother was Mandane, daughter of Astyages, last King of Media. The name appears on the monuments, written <span class="accented">Kurus.</span> Cyrus defeated his grandfather Astyages,  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>; ending thereby the Median royal line; and he defeated Croesus,  <span class="date">B.C. 546</span>, possessing himself thereby of the kingdom of Lydia; he took Babylon, as above,  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. He himself died in battle,  <span class="date">B.C. 529</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord by... Jeremiah might be accomplished</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-9.htm">Jeremiah 29:9-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus</span>. The fact is told us, and this, no doubt, as on a thousand other unsuspected occasions of far more intrinsic and vital interest in the Bible, is sufficient. It would have been interesting to know, however, even here, the mode in which Cyrus was appealed to; as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, it has been plausibly suggested that Daniel may have been in part instrumental in the work, and that, again, in part perhaps by directing the attention of Cyrus to <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> in Judah.

The adopting by Cyrus of the Hebrew "Jehovah" in both these places cannot escape our notice. There can be no room to doubt that Cyrus was acquainted with the sacred literature of the Hebrews, and especially with the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, as with the language of Daniel. It may have been partly a graceful act on the part of Cyrus to word his proclamation to the Jews thus, or it may have been simply, what under the circumstances came most naturally to him, with little or no intention in it either way. The numerous passages in Ezra parallel in matter with this verse do not need specification here. Now begins the new period of Jewish life, with fiercer probation, with unbounded and various trial, and probably of world-length continuance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/35.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 35"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 35" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezra/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezra 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezra 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
