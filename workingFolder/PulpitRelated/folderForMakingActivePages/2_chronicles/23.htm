He nerved himself with courage, and that courage which results from conviction of duty and of ripe time to achieve it. <span class="cmt_word">The captains of hundreds</span> (or, <span class="accented">centurions of the royal guards</span>) are not mentioned in the parallel by name, but the significant mention there (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5-7</a>) of five detachments (three "third parts," <span class="accented">plus</span> "two parts" of another body) tally with the number <span class="accented">five</span>, who <span class="accented">are</span> here mentioned by name. The five detachments probably summed up a force of nominally five hundred. It is interesting to note how often high religious enterprises have been due to the trusting mutual co-operation of very few to begin with, and them awakened and led by one. Of no one of these five named here is anything known more to his honour than this - that his name is here recorded. It is said with the most perfect simplicity of even Hebrew language, that <span class="cmt_word">he took them with him in covenant.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - No mention is made in the parallel of the <span class="cmt_word">Levites</span>, whom our writer is sure to signalize. The <span class="cmt_word">fathers of Israel</span>. The sacredness of the phrase made it dear, above the narrowness of the distinctive appellation <span class="accented">Judah</span>, though the worthies all were gathered, as just;implied, out of "Judah." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-3.htm">2 Chronicles 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the congregation</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who have been mentioned in vers. 1 and 2; for so the parallel makes plain. <span class="cmt_word">Made a covenant</span>. This was the second wider and more embracing covenant. <span class="accented">This</span> covenant is between all the gathered representatives and the young king, Jehoiada no doubt putting all things into shape. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign</span>. The <span class="accented">he</span> is Jehoiada, as of course. In view of the last clause of ver. 4 - in the parallel, "<span class="accented">Jehoiada showed</span> them the king's son " - the likelier rendering of our text here is, <span class="accented">Behold the king's son</span>; <span class="accented">he shall reign, as</span>, etc<span class="cmt_word">. As the Lord hath said of the sons of David</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-16.htm">2 Chronicles 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-18.htm">2 Chronicles 7:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>). The hereditary nature of the monarchy (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), pervaded ever by the spirit of the covenant, is evidently glanced at. It is probable that the existence of Joash was news to those to whom Jehoiada, as the parallel has it, "showed...  the king's son," so that double significance lies in the word "showed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, <i>shall be</i> porters of the doors;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The first thing that is to be observed is the distinct and repeated mention of the <span class="accented">Levites</span>, as those on whom the critical and onerous service that came of Jehoiada's resolution was devolved, while the parallel does not so much as mention them. It may next be noted that our first and second verses state the part that "the captains of hundreds" were called to perform in <span class="accented">collecting</span> the requisite number of Levites from the provincial cities of Judah. And once more it may be noted that whereas, while we abide close by our own text alone, nothing in the description of our vers. 4-10 occasions material difficulty, even when the perplexity, which is considerable, does enter, on consulting and endeavouring to reconcile the parallel, it is with extreme probability due to our not making sufficient allowance for the fact that the matter of the two accounts does not so much offer itself for reconciliation as for concurrent acceptance. We have now to follow the description of our own text. <span class="cmt_word">Of you entering on the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of you who enter on your period of duty on such a sabbath. See ver. 8, the "men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath." This alludes, as the next clause definitely says, to the weekly courses of the Levites, as described in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-25.htm">1 Chronicles 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>. - the incoming and outgoing companies. <span class="cmt_word">Porters of the doors;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "keepers of the doors of the temple" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>). This may correspond with the middle clause of ver. 6 in the parallel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">And a third part <i>shall be</i> at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people <i>shall be</i> in the courts of the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A third part... at the king's house</span>. It seems impossible to refer this to the royal palace, as some suppose from ver. 19 in the parallel. It probably designates the place where the child had been living in concealment. This portion of the description appears to correspond with the last clause of ver. 5 in the parallel. <span class="cmt_word">At the gate of the foundation</span>. The Hebrew text here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>); in the parallel <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, a name only found there, and unintelligible - probably a corruption of the other word. The gate of the foundation is supposed to have stood at that corner of the area which was strengthened by additional works, where was the ravine separating Moriah and the hill to the south. <span class="cmt_word">All the</span> <span class="cmt_word">people.</span> Evidently the miscellaneous outside people are not here intended, who were not entrusted with the secret and the surprise that was to be, but the same <span class="accented">all the people</span> as are unmistakably designated in ver. 10; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who were appointed to officiate. The last clause in each of vers. 5, 6, 7 in the parallel go strongly to confirm the position that" the king's house "so far does not intend the royal palace, but such part of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">house of the Lord</span> as had been, and then still was, "about the king" (ver. 7, parallel); in order to keep watch "about the king,' they were set to keep watch of a certain part of "the house of the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they <i>are</i> holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But let</span> <span class="cmt_word">none come... save the priests</span>. Through this little chink we get some light confirmatory of the concurrent jurisdiction of the account in the parallel The express caution of this clause shows that there were others about, and others officiating, beside the Levites, who only have been mentioned hitherto in our text, except under the most generic designation (as before, so again in last clause of this verse) of "all the people." The last clause of this verse may cover the contents of ver. 7 in the parallel. The distinction between "the courts of the house of the Lord" (ver. 5), and "the house of the Lord" (ver. 6) is, of course, quite apparent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-7.htm">2 Chronicles 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever <i>else</i> cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Levites shall compass the king</span>. The matter of ver. 8 in the parallel suggests nothing inconsistent with the express mention of the Levites here, but rather that the word "Levites" is desiderated there, and its significance perhaps accidentally overlooked, when the writer of Kings was using the original authorities and sources of his history. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go <i>out</i> on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All Judah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all those of Judah's provincial cities who had been honoured with summons to join in this great and solemn enterprise. <span class="cmt_word">Dismissed not the courses</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the provincial Levites cooperated with the regulars of Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that <i>had been</i> king David's, which <i>were</i> in the house of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shields... King David's ...  in the house of God</span>. Some think these may have been the shields of gold that King David took from the servants of Hadadezer (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7, 11</a>).

The parallel (ver. 11) summarizes them under the name <span class="accented">the guard.</span> It may be just noted, in passing, that, while the Hebrew text has in both places "shoulder," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the "side" of this verse, and the "corner" of the parallel, the Revised Version has harmonized the rendering, electing the rendering <span class="accented">side. <span class="cmt_word"></span>From the right side of the temple to the left side.</span> This is equivalent to saying, those composing the guard were placed on the south and north sides. <span class="cmt_word">Along by the altar</span>. This was the altar of burnt offerings in front of the perch, and close by which the young "king stood at his pillar," or on his <span class="accented">pedestal</span> (ver. 13), the rows of the guard bristling with weapons before and behind and round about him.

The parallel (ver. 12) has, "he brought out," etc. The last clause of our verse harmonizes even this simple point, indicating that the "they" designates "Jehoiada and his sons;" of which group Jehoiada himself was, of course, the greatest part. It will be noted that it is not said from what exact place Joash was brought out. <span class="cmt_word">Put</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon him the crown and...</span> the testimony. It is quite unnecessary, at any rate, to suppose that the <span class="accented">testimony, as</span> well as the <span class="accented">crown</span>, was <span class="accented">put on the head of Joash</span>.

If something new and so out of the way as resting the testimony (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the book of the Law) on the head were purported, it is likely that a distincter point would have been made of it. <span class="cmt_word">God save the king!</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>: "Let the king live!"

The parallel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-13.htm">2 Kings 11:13-16</a>) shows only two differences of any noteworthiness, and these will come under notice next verse. <span class="accented">The noise</span>; Hebrew, the voice; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no doubt the voices of the people. <span class="cmt_word">Praising</span>.

The ranges are commonly supposed to mean the ranks or rows of soldiers. The Vulgate (<span class="accented">septa templi</span>) has understood them to mean the precincts of the temple.
