The word signifies "lofty," and the present history speaks the importance of its position, and would infer also that Israel had regained Bethel, which, with other adjacent places, Abijah had wrested from Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>). The reference of <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>, 82 is exceedingly interesting, and bespeaks the fact that Ramah commanded another intersecting route from Ephraim. When it is said here that Baasha built (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) Ramah, the meaning is that he was beginning to strengthen it greatly, and fortify it. The object of Baasha, which no doubt needed no stating in the facts of the day, is now stated by history.

Benhidri is the name of Benhadad in the Assyrian monuments. The Septuagint gives Ader, which tallies with it, For <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span>, we have here <span class="accented">Dar-mesek</span>, instead of the more usual <span class="accented">Dammesek</span> of the parallel and <a href="../../par/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>; the <span class="accented">resh</span> representing (as in Syriac) the dagesh forte in <span class="accented">men.</span> The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>) says that Asa took all the silver and the gold left in the treasures, etc.; but the reading "left" should very possibly (see Septuagint Version) be "found," the Hebrew characters easily permitting it.

For there is, read "<span class="accented">Let there</span> be a league between me and thee, as between my father and thy father;" the short cut which Area thought to take now to his object was not the safe nor right one.

The bribe that tempted him, drawn from "the treasures" described, well replenished (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-18.htm">2 Chronicles 15:18</a>; and parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>), was probably large. His method was to create a diversion in favour of his new ally, by "smiting" certain picked and highly important cities of Israel, mostly in northern Galilee, by name "Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtalli." <span class="cmt_word">Ijon</span>. In Naphtali, mentioned only now, in the parallel, and when a second time taken (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) by Tiglath-Pileser. <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span>. The colonizing of this city is given in <a href="../../par/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1, 2, 29-31</a>; it was originally called Laish, and became the northern landmark of the whole country, as in the expression, "from Dan even to Beersheba" (Judges 17:29; 20:1). <span class="cmt_word">Abel-maim</span>. This place was situate at the foot of the Lebanon; in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>) it is called Abel-beth-maachah. It is again mentioned as attacked by Tiglath-Pileser, who wrested it from Pekah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18, 14, 15</a> it is called Abel by itself, but in the last two of these verses Beth-maachah is mentioned in close connection with it. After this name the parallel gives also "all Cinneroth" (Septuagint, "all the land of Cinnereth"). The name is the original of the New Testament <span class="accented">Gennesaret</span>. It was a city (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>) that gave its name to the sea and western region of the lake, sometimes called so (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>). If there were a little more external evidence of it, we should incline to the opinion of Movers, that the "all Cinneroth" of the parallel is the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">"</span>all the store-cities") of our present verse. But at present we may take it that the two records supplement one another. <span class="cmt_word">All the store-cities of Naphtali</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-6.htm">2 Chronicles 8:6</a> and its parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-5.htm">2 Chronicles 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when Baasha heard <i>it</i>, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let his work cease</span>. The parallel has not this, but follows the exact previous sentence with this, "and dwelt in Tirzah." It is the happy suggestion of one commentator (Professor James G. Murphy, 'Handbook: Chronicles') that this sentence may betray that it had been Baasha's intention to reside in <span class="cmt_word">Ramah</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The affair seems thus to have come to an unbloody termination. The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>)is so much the more graphic that it contains the two additions that Asa "made a proclamation throughout all Judah," and one that "exempted none" from joining in the duty of moving all the stones and all the timber from Ramah, and diverting' them to the use of building Geba and Mizpah. This greatly contributed to command the road from the north to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Geba</span>. This was Geba of Benjamin, as clearly stated in the parallel. It was a position north of Ramah, whether opposite Michmash and the modern Jeba is not certain, as some think this answers to Gibeah of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mizpah</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2, 3, 9, 10</a>). This Mizpah is not that of the Shefelah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>), but was situate about two hours, or a short six miles, north-west of Jerusalem, on the Samaria route, and is probably the modern <span class="accented">Neby Samwil</span> (see also <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5-41:18</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> The very impressive episode of four verses begun by the seventh verse is not found in the parallel. The fact furnishes clear indication that our compiler was not indebted to the writer of Kings for material. And the moral aspects of the matter here preserved by the compiler of Chronicles show the paramount reasons why he would not miss bringing it to the front for the returned people's better religious education. Presumably <span class="cmt_word">Hanani the seer</span> is the father of that other faithful seer and prophet Jehu, who appeared to Baasha (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1, 7</a>) and to Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore is the host of the King of Syria escaped out of thy hand</span> It is plain that, reading the lines only, this expression (remarkable considering its following close upon successful help given by Benhadad, and help unaccompanied, so far as we are told, by any infidelity or untoward circumstance), suggests option of explanation, and would engender the supposition that something very threatening was on the horizon, at any rate. But reading <span class="accented">between the</span> lines, and giving due weight to the significance of the illustration adduced of the combined Ethiopians and Lubim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), we may warrantably judge that Hanani's inspired language went a cut deeper, and meant that if the alliance had been not broken between Benhadad and Baasha, both would surely have been taken in one net (<a href="../../par/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>), as they would have entered into the conflict in alliance. A decisive victory over the King of Syria would have been any way a grand day in the history of Judah; But such a victory over the Kings of Syria and of the northern schismatic kingdom would have been more than a doubly grand day; it would have been a tenfold demonstration of God's judgment, that "though hand join in hand, yet shall not the wicked go unpunished" (see particularly same Hebrew verb used of a bird escaped in <a href="../../par/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>).

Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt have wars</span>. Although this language at first seems to be intended for very specific application to Asa, yet as we do not read of individual wars occurring after this in his own time, it is quite within a just interpretation of it if we read it as referring to the inevitable experience of the kingdom. Its head and king had just thrown away the opportunity of blocking out one ever-threatening enemy. What more natural consequence than that wars should rush in the rather as a flood, in the after-times? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-10.htm">2 Chronicles 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for <i>he was</i> in a rage with him because of this <i>thing</i>.

The word occurs three other times only, all of them in Jeremiah viz. 20:2, 3; 29:26. (For a forcible parallel, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time</span>. This may throw some explanatory, though no exculpatory, light on Asa's wrath and violence towards Hanani; for it probably marks that either some goodly portion of the wiser of the people had anticipated of their own common sense the matter of the message of Hanani the seer, or that they had not failed to follow it with some keenly sympathetic remarks For our Authorized Version, "oppressed," read a stronger verb, as "crushed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-11.htm">2 Chronicles 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - This verse, with the following three, is represented by the very summarized but sufficiently significant parallel of <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23, 24</a>. Note that the reference work cited in this verse as the book of the <span class="cmt_word">kings of Judah and Israel</span>, is in the paralled cited as "the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah." Of course, the latter citation was much the earlier in point of time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease <i>was</i> exceeding <i>great</i>: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His disease was exceeding great</span> Perhaps a somewhat more literal rendering will more correctly express the emphasis of the original, <span class="accented">e.g. his disease was great even to excess</span>. For yet, read emphatically, and <span class="accented">also</span>; the historian purposing to say that as, in his fear of Baasha, he had not sought the <span class="accented">Lord, but Benhadad, so, in his</span> excessive illness also, he had not sought the Lord, but the physicians! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-13.htm">2 Chronicles 16:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Amid the frequent uncertainties of the chronology, we are glad to get some dates fixed by the agreement of testimonies. <span class="accented">E.g.</span> this place and the parallel state clearly that Asa's reign was one that lasted to its forty-first year. The parallel, however (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>), makes this date one and the same thing with his "old age<span class="accented"></span>," while no manipulation of dates can make him (the grandson of Rehoboam and son of Abijah) more than about fifty. And it is somewhat remarkable that, when introduced to us as succeeding to the throne, nothing is said of his tender youth (as, for instance, is said in the case of Josiah, <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-3</a>). Nevertheless, the apparent prominence of Maachah awhile would tally with the circumstance of Asa's youth at his accession. Another correspondence in Josiah's career is noticeable; for it is distinctly said that when he was only twelve years of age (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>) "he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places," etc. At a similarly youthful age Asa, therefore, may be credited with doing the like, while later on he took more stringent measures, as for instance with Maachah, the queen-mother.

The use or associations of this word (found about fifty times) are almost entirely, if not entirely, those of the bed of nightly rest, even when not at the time speaking of nightly rest; and this is the first and only occasion that it is employed to link the grave in kindly analogy with the couch of bodily repose during lifetime. The fact might have suggested Bishop Ken's lines in the evening hymn - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"<span class="accented">Teach me to live, that I may dread<br />The grave as little as my bed."</span> In the present instance, however, the writer, whoever he was (query, was he the compiler of our Chronicles, or his original?), is doubt-leas led to the analogy by considerations mere earthly than those enshrined in Ken's hymn, viz. by the somewhat "vain show" of attractiveness and fragrance (probably designed partly for preservative purposes) with which the place was filled, and which were among even patriarchal indications of faith in a future state. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet odours</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.
