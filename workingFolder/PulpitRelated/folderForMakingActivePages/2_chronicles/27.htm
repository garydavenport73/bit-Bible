His mother's name also <i>was</i> Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerushah</span>. This name in the parallel is spelt with a final <span class="accented">aleph</span> instead of <span class="accented">he.</span> Nothing else is known of Jerushah, nor of her father <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he did <i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span>. This word purports to render the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, which might find a more telling reproduction in such a phrase as "and moreover." It has been said, wherein his father did right, so did he; and to his clear advantage, where his father went wrong, he did riot. <span class="cmt_word">The people did yet corruptly</span>. The parallel, in its ver. 35, specifies in what this <span class="accented">consisted, viz.</span> that they continued the high places, burning incense and sacrificing at them. The early chapters of Isaiah depict forcibly the extent of this national apostasy, and the heinous offensiveness of it in the Divine sight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a></div><div class="verse">He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high</span> <span class="cmt_word">gate.</span> In the parallel, rendered in the Authorized Version the "higher" gate, the Hebrew (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) being the same in both places. The Revised Version shows "upper gate" in both places. It was probably the gate which led from the palace to the temple's outer court (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-20.htm">2 Chronicles 23:20</a>, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">On the wall</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Ophel</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. the ophel</span>, which may be Englished "the swelling ground." It was the extreme south end of the spur which gradually narrowed southward, and which was the continuation of the <span class="accented">Bezetha hill</span>, bounded by the brook Kedron on the east, and the Tyropceon on the west. This extreme south part called the Ophel sank into the bounding valleys to the Kedron precipitously and to the Tyropeon gradually. Pp. 328-335 of Condor's 'Handbook' (2nd edit.), and specially pp. 332-334, well repay a thorough study. A ditch was cut across the narrowest part of the ridge, which separated the temple hill itself from the Bezetha hill. In these parts fortifications were built, and no doubt to such it is our text calls attention.

And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He fought...  the King of the Ammonites</span>. No allusion is made to the matter of this verse in the parallel, which contains a statement of the Syrian Rezin's attack or threatened invasion of Judah; as well as Pekah's, son of Remaliah King of Israel. Of the Ammonites' defeat by Uzziah we have just heard (foregoing chapter, ver. 8). A general statement is all that is made there of the gifts or tribute, they then had to pay. The present tribute was a heavy payment, and enforced for three, years. The "wheat" and "barley," in which payment was largely made bespeak the fertile arable quality of the Ammonite land, and this is noticed by travellers to the present day.
