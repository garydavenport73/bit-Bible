This in worthier material superseded the temporary altar of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1, 2</a>), made of shittim wood, and its dimensions five cubits long and broad and three cubits high. Large as was the present altar of brass as compared with the altar that preceded, it fell far short of the requirements of the grand day of dedication (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-64.htm">1 Kings 8:64</a>). No statement of the making of this altar occurs in the parallel. The place of it would be between vers. 22 and 23 of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. But that Solomon made it is stated in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>, and other references to its presence are found in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22, 54, 64</a>, etc. The position given to the altar is referred to alike in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-12.htm">2 Chronicles 6:12, 13</a>, as in the court of the temple. It may be well to note that the altar, <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, comes first, and is first spoken of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-2.htm">2 Chronicles 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A molten sea</span>. The Hebrew of this verse and of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> are facsimiles of one author, except that here <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> stands, where the parallel shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, probably the fruit merely of some error in transcription. Verses like these point not to the derivation of Chronicles from Kings, but rather of both from some older common source. This sea of brass superseded the laver of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-9.htm">Exodus 31:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a>). It was called a sea on account of its size. We are told in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a> whence David had drawn the supplies of metal necessary for this work. The size of the diameter measured from upper rim to rim (ten cubits) harmonizes, of course, to all practical purposes, with that of the circumference (thirty cubits); it would assist questions connected with the contents of this large vessel, however, if we had been told whether the circumference were measured at the rim, or, as the form of language here used might slightly favour, round the girth. (For these questions, see ver. 5 below.) This sea for the washing of the priests significantly follows the altar. Beside the general suggestion of the need of purification or sanctification, it here reminds of the fact that the earthly priest and high priest must need the purification, which their great Antitype would not need. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-3.htm">2 Chronicles 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">And under it <i>was</i> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen <i>were</i> cast, when it was cast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The similitude</span> <span class="cmt_word">of oxen.</span> The parallel gives simply "knops" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> flower-buds) in the room of this expression, and no word "similitude" at all, the characters spelling the word for "knops" being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and those for "oxen" being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The presence of the word "similitude" strongly suggests that the circles of decoration under description showed the likenesses of oxen, not necessarily (as Patrick) "stamped" on the so-called knops, but possibly constituting them. For the ambiguous under it of our present verse the parallel says with definiteness, "under the brim of it." There is intelligibility, at all events, in the ornamentation being of these miniature oxen, presumably three hundred in the circle of the thirty cubits. The symbolism would harmonize with that which dictated the superposition of the enormous vase on twelve probably life-size oxen. There is a general preference, however, accorded to the opinion that the present text has probably been the result of some copyist's corruption, and that the text of the parallel should be followed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-4.htm">2 Chronicles 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea <i>was set</i> above upon them, and all their hinder parts <i>were</i> inward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The words of the Hebrew text of this verse and the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-25.htm">1 Kings 7:25</a>) are facsimiles.

It received and held should be translated, <span class="accented">it was able</span> to <span class="accented">hold</span>. Three thousand baths. The parallel has two thousand baths, and this latter is the likelier reading. It is, however, conceivable that the statement of Kings may purport to give the quantity of water used, and that of Chronicles the quantity which the vessel at its fullest could accommodate. As to the real capacity of the bath, we are hopelessly at sea. Josephus's estimate of it is about eight gallons and a half, that of the rabbinists about four gallons and a half (see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 3:1742), and Conder, in the 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 80, a fractional quantity above six gallons. The largest bowls on the Assyrian bas-reliefs, the silver bowl of Croesus, and the bronze bowl in Scythia (Herodotus, 1:51; 4:81), did not, under the lowest estimate of the bath, hold as much as one-half of the contents of this vast sea of brass of Solomon. The use of this vessel was, as we read in the next verse, for the priests to wash in, or, as some would read, to wash at (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea <i>was</i> for the priests to wash in.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - This verse, with vers. 14, 15, are all here that represent the lengthy account of bases rather than layers, occupying in the parallel vers. 27-39 of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>, which, however, omits to state the use of either sea or layers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-7.htm">2 Chronicles 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ten candlesticks of gold</span>. The only allusion to these in the parallel is found later on in part of the forty-ninth verse of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. According to their form. This expression, though so vague, might point to the fact that the form of the old candlestick of the tabernacle was adhered to (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>). But considering the recurrence of the same words (ver. 20), there can be no doubt that the phrase is identical in its meaning with the use found in such passages as <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>, and means "according to the prescribed ordinance," 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">He made also ten tables, and placed <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left.

These tables also (the use of which is given in ver. 19) are not mentioned, so far as their making is concerned, in the parallel, except in its summary, ver. 48 (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>.), where furthermore only one table, called "the table" (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>), is specified, with which agrees our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>. It is hard to explain this variation of statement. It is at least an arbitrary and forced explanation to suppose that ten tables constituted the furniture in question, while only one was used at a time. Keil and Bertheau think that the analogy of the ten candlesticks points to the existence of ten tables. The question, however, is, where is the call for, or where are the indications of any analogy? <span class="cmt_word">An hundred basins of gold</span>. The Hebrew word employed here, and translated "basins," is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, as also vers. 11, 22, <span class="accented">infra</span>; and <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40, 45, 50</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a>; but it is represented as well by the English translation "bowls" in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-17.htm">1 Chronicles 28:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13, 19</a>, etc. The "pots," however, of our vers. 11, 16 has for its Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. It were well if, in names such as these, at any rate, an absolute uniformity of version were observed in the translation, for the benefit of the English reader, to say nothing of the saving of wasted time for the student and scholar. These <span class="accented">basins</span>, or <span class="accented">bowls</span>, were to receive and hold the blood of the slain victims, about to be sprinkled for purification (see <a href="../../par/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6-8</a>, where the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> is used; Exodus 29:12, 10, 20, 21; <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>, and <span class="accented">passion</span>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18-20</a>; see also <a href="../../par/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a>,) The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span>, whether appearing in our version as" basin"' or "bowl," occurs thirty-two times, sixteen in association exactly similar with the present (viz. <a href="../../par/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40, 45, 50</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-13.htm">2 Kings 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-17.htm">1 Chronicles 28:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8, 11, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-18.htm">Jeremiah 52:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>), fourteen as <span class="accented">silver bowls</span> in the time of the tabernacle for the meat offering of "fine flour mingled with oil" (vie. <a href="../../par/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 84, 85</a>), and the remaining two in an entirely general application (<a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-15.htm">Zechariah 9:15</a>). It is evident, therefore, that the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> was not the only vessel used for holding the blood of purification, nor was it exclusively reserved to this use.

The construction of this court of the priests, withheld here, given there, leaves it ambiguous whether the "three rows of hewed stones and one row of cedar beams "intends a description of fence, as the Septuagint seems to have taken it, or of a higher floor with which the part in question was dignified. The citation <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, though probably pointing to this same court, can scarcely be adduced as any support of J. D. Michaelis' suggestion of this latter, as its <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (translated "higher") does not really carry the idea of the comparative degree at all.

It is worthy of note that the word employed in our text, as also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>, is not the familiar word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> of all previous similar occasions, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;</span>, a word of the later Hebrew, occurring also several times in Ezekiel, though not in exactly the same sense, and the elementary signification of the verb-root of which is "to gird," or "surround."

The sea found its position, therefore, in the place of the tabernacle laver of old, between altar of brass and porch.

These bases were, as may be learnt more fully in the parallel, pedestals of brass four cubits square by three and a half high, supported by wheels a cubit and a half in diameter. The pedestals were richly decorated with mouldings, and with the similitudes of lions, oxen, and cherubim, and with other subordinate ornamental work, and were designed to bear the layers, the use of which is given in ver. 6. Vers. 6-16 in our chapter strongly suggest, in their repetitiousness, the writer's resort to different sources and authorities for his matter.

The present ten <span class="accented">candlesticks</span>, or strictly candelabra, of Solomon are said at one time to have been placed in a row like a rail before the veil, and connected with a chain under which the high priest went on the Day of Atonement into the inner sanctuary. The removal of these candelabra is recorded <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a>. The expression, "after the manner," points to the various and somewhat minute regulation for the lighting, trimming, and keeping alight of the <span class="accented">lamps</span>, all or some, of the candelabra (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-19.htm">Exodus 27:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-1.htm">Leviticus 24:1-3</a>). The use of the word for "lamp" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>) in some passages (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>)suggests not the part as used for the whole in speaking of the candelabrum, but more probably that the <span class="accented">perpetual</span> burning was not of all seven lamps, but of one, the central shaft.

This latter is the correcter translation, perhaps. The instrument, at any rate, was to trim the lamp-wicks (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>).

A slightly different form of the word is translated "pruning-hooks "four times in the Prophets Isaiah, Joel, Micah. No doubt these <span class="accented">snuffers</span> were something different from the <span class="accented">tongs</span> of the preceding verse; the use of one may have been rather to cut the wicks, and the other to trim them. <span class="cmt_word">The spoons;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>.
