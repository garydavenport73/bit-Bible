His reign extended to twenty-five years, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from  <span class="date">B.C. 914</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 889</span>.

Although there would be no difficulty in reconciling this statement with history, yet probably the name David should not stand here. It is not in the Septuagint. The most natural and sufficient reference is to Asa<span class="cmt_word">. And sought not unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">Ballim;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to the Baalim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the various false gods of surrounding peoples (<a href="../../par/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>), Baal-berith (<a href="../../par/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4, 46</a>), Baal-zebub (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>), Baal-peor (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-28.htm">Numbers 23:28</a>, etc.; Numbers 25:3), according to the places where the idolatrous worship was carried on. (For the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>, "to," after "sought," in this and following verse, see again <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-19.htm">1 Chronicles 22:19</a>.)

This expression probably marks the doings of the northern kingdom, as both the more typical throughout its whole history of the wrong, and also as the systematic beginning, "by a law," of idolatrous worship and images in the matter of the calves and so on.

These <span class="accented">presents</span> were, of course, voluntary gifts, though, like not a few others, custom may have taken off from them something of the bloom of spontaneousness (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>).

Although the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> often carries a bad sense with it, it quite as often carries with it a good one in the Old Testament, and the typical instance of the former (<a href="../../par/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>) is fully counterbalanced by <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>.

The Hebrew text distinctly says, <span class="cmt_word">he sent to his princes</span>, not, "he sent his princes." The meaning is - he sent orders to his princes to see to it that Judah was taught (ver. 9) <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">book of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Law of the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>), not, indeed, without their own personal aid in whatever way able to be given, but systematically and with authority by the Levites and priests (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>). This deeper fathoming of the needs of the time, and of what constituted its real safety, was greatly to the spiritual credit of Jehoshaphat. The references (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-2.htm">2 Chronicles 35:2-4, 10-12</a>) are full of point. None of these princes, or Levites and priests, are elsewhere mentioned by name.

The word means "bearing" or "carrying," and then "a burden, load, or weight." The expression (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25</a>), "more than they could carry away," where this word is used, favours the idea that the meaning here is "silver of great weight." Probably the moral significance and historical interest, whether of this statement respecting <span class="cmt_word">the Philistines</span>, or the following respecting <span class="cmt_word">the Arabians,</span> lies in the fact that both of them brought, without more ado, their payments, and did not seek to slip out of their engagements with Judah and Judah's king. Note, for confirmation of this view, <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4, 5</a>.

Possibly he comes from an unexpected quarter, and is a man of approved skill. Nothing further is known of these three men. Meantime it has been suggested (Professor Dr. J.
