The historian relates first a (comparatively) private miracle wrought by Elisha in the vicinity of Jericho, for the benefit of one of the "sons of the prophets" (vers. 1-8). He then tells us briVerse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee</span> - literally, <span class="accented">before</span> thee - <span class="cmt_word">is too strait for us.</span> The scene of this miracle is probably the vicinity of Jericho, since both Gilgal and Bethel were remote from the Jordan. The "school of the prophets" at Jericho, whereof we heard in <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5, 19</a>, had increased so much, that the buildings which hitherto had accommodated it were no longer sufficient. A larger dwelling, or set of dwelling, was thought to be necessary; but the scholars would make no change without the sanction of their master. When he comes on one of his circuits, they make appeal to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-2.htm">2 Kings 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan.</span> Jericho was situated at some little distance from the Jordan, on the banks of a small stream, which ran into it. Along the course of the Jordan trees and shrubs were abundant, chiefly willows, poplars, and tamarisks (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:08. &sect; 3; Strabo, 16:2. &sect; 41). It would seem that the Jordan thickets were unappropriated, and that any one might cut timber in them. <span class="cmt_word">And take thence every man a beam.</span> The meaning is, "Let us <span class="accented">all</span> join in the work, each cutting beams and carrying them; and the work will soon be accomplished." <span class="cmt_word">And let us make us a place there.</span> They propose to build the new dwelling on the banks of Jordan, to save the trouble of conveying the materials any long distance. <span class="cmt_word">Where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.</span> Elisha, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, approved the proposal, gave it his sanction and encouragement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-3.htm">2 Kings 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.</span> One of the number was not satisfied with the prophet's mere approval of the enterprise, but wished for his actual presence, probably as securing a blessing upon the work. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, I will go.</span> Elisha approved the man's idea, as springing from piety and faith in God. He, therefore, raised no difficulty, but at once, in the simplest manner, acceded to the request. There is a remarkable directness, simplicity, and absence of fuss in all that Elisha says and does. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-4.htm">2 Kings 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the river-bank - <span class="cmt_word">they cut down wood.</span> They set to work, each felling his tree, and fashioning it into a rough beam. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-5.htm">2 Kings 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as one was felling a beam</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a tree, to make it into a beam - <span class="cmt_word">the axe-head</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the iron</span>. We see from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a> that the Hebrews made their axe-heads of iron as early as the time of Moses. They probably learnt to smelt and work iron in Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">Fell into the water.</span> The tree must have been one that grew close to the river's edge. As the man hewed away at the stem a little above the root, the axe-head flew from the haft, into which it was insecurely fitted, and fell into the water. The slipping of an axe-head was a very common occurrence (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>), and ordinarily was of little consequence, since it was easily restored to its place. But now the head had disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">And he cried, and said, Alas, master!</span> - rather, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my master</span>! or, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my lord</span>! - <span class="cmt_word">for it was borrowed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was a borrowed one</span>. The words are part of the man's address to Elisha. He means to say, "It is no common misfortune; it is not as if it had been my own axe. I had borrowed it, and now what shall I say to the owner?" There is no direct request for help, but the tone of the complaint constitutes a sort of silent appeal. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast <i>it</i> in thither; and the iron did swim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.</span> Two natural explanations of this miracle have been attempted: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Elisha passed a piece of wood underneath the axe-head, which he could see lying at the bottom of the river, and then lifted it up to the surface (Von Gerlach); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he thrust a stick or bar of wood through the hole in the axe-head, made to receive the haft, and so pulled it out (Thenins). But both explanations do violence to the text; and we may be sure that, had either been true, the occurrence would not have been recorded. The sacred writers are not concerned to put on record mere acts of manual dexterity.

And he put out his hand, and took it.</span> Elisha does not take the axe-head out of the water himself, but requires the scholar to do it, in order to test his faith. He must show that he Believes the miracle, and regards the iron as really floating on the top of the water, not as merely appearing to dose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place <i>shall be</i> my camp.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8-</span><a href="../../par/2_kings/7-20.htm">2 Kings 7:20</a>. - PUBLIC MIRACLES or ELISHA (<span class="accented">resumed</span>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the King of Syria warred against Israel.</span> It may seem strange that, so soon after sending an embassy to the court of Samaria, and asking a favor (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5, 6</a>), Benhadad should resume hostilities, especially as the favor had been obtained (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>); but the normal relations between the two countries were those of enmity (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2</a>), and a few years would suffice to dim the memory of what had happened. The gratitude of kings is proverbially short-lived. <span class="cmt_word">And took counsel with his servants</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, his chief officers - <span class="cmt_word">saying, In such and such a place</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a>) <span class="cmt_word">shall be my camp</span>; or, my <span class="accented">encampment</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b9;&#x5d7;</span> appears to be "a noun in the form of the infinitive." It does not occur elsewhere. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Elisha, who at the time was "<span class="accented">the</span> man of God "(<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">sent unto the King of Israel</span> - Jehoram, undoubtedly (see ver. 32) - <span class="cmt_word">saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.</span> Some translate, "Beware that thou <span class="accented">neglect</span> not such a place, for thither the Syrians <span class="accented">are coming</span> down;" but our version is probably correct, and is approved by Bahr and Thenius. Elisha did not suffer his hostile feeling towards Jehoram personally (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-13.htm">2 Kings 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-8.htm">2 Kings 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>) to interfere with his patriotism. When disaster threatened his country, he felt it incumbent on him to warn even an ungodly king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-10.htm">2 Kings 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Israel sent to the place.</span> Recent commentators (Keil, Thenius, Bahr) mostly suppose this to mean that Jehoram sent troops to the place pointed out by the prophet, and anticipated the Syrians by occupying it. But it agrees better with the prophet's injunction, "Beware that thou <span class="accented">pass not</span> such a place," to suppose that he merely sent out scouts to see if the place were occupied or no, and finding, in each case, Elisha's warning true, he avoided the locality. <span class="cmt_word">Which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> repeatedly; at least three several times, perhaps more. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-11.htm">2 Kings 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us <i>is</i> for the king of Israel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the heart of the King of Syria was sore troubled for this thing.</span> Keil says, "The King of the Syrians was enraged at this;" but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> exactly expresses "trouble," "disturbance," not "rage," being used of the tossing of the sea, in <a href="../../par/jonah/1-11.htm">Jonah 1:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?</span> Benhadad not unnaturally suspected treachery among his own subjects. How otherwise could the King of Israel become, over and over again, aware of his intentions? Some one or other of his officers must, he thought, betray his plans to the enemy. Cannot the others point out the traitor? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-12.htm">2 Kings 6:12</a></div><div class="verse">And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that <i>is</i> in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one of his servants said</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of those interrogated, answered - <span class="cmt_word">None, my lord, O king</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Nay</span>, <span class="accented">my lord</span>, <span class="accented">the king - meaning</span>, "<span class="accented">Think</span> not so; it is not as thou supposest; there is no traitor in thy camp or in thy court; we are all true men.

How the Syrian lord knew this, or whether he merely made a shrewd guess, we cannot say. Elisha's miraculous gifts had, no doubt, become widely known to the Syrians through the cure of Naaman's leprosy; and the lord, who may possibly have been Naaman himself, concluded that a man who could cure s leper could also read a king's secret thoughts without difficulty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/6-13.htm">2 Kings 6:13</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Go and spy where he <i>is</i>, that I may send and fetch him.

The object was scarcely "to find out, through Elisha, what the King of Israel and other princes were plotting against him in their secret counsels" (Cassel), but simply to put a stop to Elisha's betrayal of his own plans to Jobs-ram. <span class="cmt_word">And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</span> The spies were sent, and brought back word that, at the time, Elisha was residing in Dothan. Dothan, the place where Joseph was sold by his brethren to the Ishmaelites (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-17.htm">Genesis 37:17</a>), lay evidently not very far from Shechem (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>), and is placed by Eusebius about twelve miles north of Samaria. In the Book of Judith (4:6; 7:3) it is mentioned among the cities bordering the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. Modern travelers (Van de Velde, Robinson) have reasonably identified it with the present <span class="accented">Dothan</span>, a tel, or hill, of a marked character, covered with ruins, and from the foot of which arises a copious spring, to the south-west of Jenin, between that place and Jeba, a little to the left of the great road leading from Beisan (Scythopolis) to Egypt.

A force of footmen, a force of horsemen, and a chariot force, are intended (cutup. ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</span> Though the servant could not know that it was Elisha's person which was especially sought, yet he was naturally alarmed at seeing the city invested by a hostile force, and anticipated either death or capture, which last would involve the being sold as a slave.

His mental state required something like a material manifestation; and hence Elisha prays that he may be permitted to behold the angelic host, which everywhere throughout creation is employed at all times in doing the will of God, and accomplishing his ends (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, etc.).

But for the delusion, they would have suspected, made inquiries of others, and retreated hastily, as soon as the walls and towers of Samaria broke on their sight.

It is certain that the Israelites were in the habit of putting to death their prisoners of war, not only when they were captured with arms in their hands, but even when they surrendered themselves. When a city or country was conquered, the whole male population of full age was commonly put to death (<a href="../../par/numbers/31-7.htm">Numbers 31:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>, etc.). When a third part was spared, it was from some consideration of relationship (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The Law distinctly allowed, if it did not even enjoin, the practice (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>). Jehoram, therefore, no doubt, put his prisoners of war to death under ordinary circumstances. But he hesitates now. He feels that the case is an extraordinary one, and that the prophet, who has made the capture, is entitled to be consulted on the subject. Hence his question.

His prohibition is absolute. These prisoners, at any rate, are not to be slain. "The object of the miracle," as Keil says, "would have been frustrated, if the Syrians had been slain.

There was also, perhaps, a further political object. By sparing the prisoners and treating them with kindness, it might be possible to touch the heart of the King of Syria, and dispose him towards peace. <span class="cmt_word">Wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Wouldest</span> thou be smiting those, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Wouldest thou, in smiting these persons, be smiting those whom thou hadst made prisoners in war, so as to be able to justify thy conduct by <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>?

Bahr supposes that the raids were discontinued simply "because the Syrians had found out that they could not accomplish anything by these expeditions, but rather brought themselves into circumstances of great peril" ('Commentary on Kings,' vol. it. p. 69). But the <span class="accented">nexus</span> of the clause, "So the bands," etc., rather implies that the cessation was the consequence of Jehoram's sparing and entertaining the captives.

Artaxerx.,' &sect; 24), where an ass's head was sold for sixty drachmas (about forty shillings). "Dove's dung" is thought by some to be the name of a plant; but it is better to understand the term literally. Both animal and human excrement have been eaten in sieges (Josephus, ' Bell.

We are scarcely entitled to deny him any true penitential feeling, though no doubt he was far from possessing a chastened or humble spirit. Poor weak humanity has at one and the same time good and evil impulses, praiseworthy and culpable feelings, thoughts which come from the Holy Spirit of God, and thoughts which are inspired by the evil one.

It was an imprecation of evil on one's self, if one did, or if one failed to do, a certain thing. Why Jehoram should have considered Elisha as responsible for all the horrors of the siege is not apparent; but perhaps he supposed that it was in Elisha's power to work a miracle of any kind at any moment that he liked. If so, he misunderstood the nature of the miraculous gift. In threatening to behead Elisha, he is not making himself an executor of the Law, which nowhere sanctioned that mode of punishment, but assuming the arbitrary power of the other Oriental monarchs of his time, who regarded themselves as absolute masters of the lives and liberties of their subjects. Beheading was common in Egypt, in Babylonia, and in Assyria.

He calls the king "this son of a murderer," or rather "this son of <span class="accented">the</span> murderer," with reference to Ahab, the great murderer of the time, who had sanctioned all Jezebel's cruelties-the general massacre of the prophets of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>), the judicial murder of Naboth (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9-13</a>), the attempt to kill Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>) - and had, by a fierce and long continued persecution, reduced the worshippers of Jehovah in Israel to the scanty number of seven thousand (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). Jehoram had now shown that he inherited the bloodthirsty disposition of his father, and had justly earned the epithet which Elisha bestowed on him. <span class="cmt_word">Look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door.</span> Keil renders the last clause, "force him back at the door;" the LXX.

The reader is expected to supply missing links, and to understand that all happened as Elisha had predicted and enjoined - that the messenger came, that the elders stopped him, and that the king shortly arrived.

We must understand that they had been in communication previously on the subject of the siege, and that Elisha had encouraged the king to "wait for" an interposition of Jehovah. The king now urges that the time for waiting is over; matters are at the last gasp; "this evil" this terrible suffering which can no longer be endured - "is of the Lord," has come from him, is continued by him, and is not relieved. What use is there in his "waiting" any longer? Why should he not break with Jehovah, behead the lying prophet, and surrender the town?
