Such persons may still have taught in the prophetical schools, as do the married tutors and professors of modern universities. <span class="cmt_word">Thy servant my husband is dead.</span> Elisha had, it seems, known her husband, who had been his "servant," not literally and in deed, but in will and heart, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> always ready to serve him. She recalls this fact to his memory, to predispose him in her favor. <span class="cmt_word">And thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord.</span> Here was a second ground for Elisha's interference - the woman's husband had been a God-fearing man, one who not only acknowledged Jehovah, but worshipped him in spirit and in truth. There is a Jewish tradition, or legend, that the woman's husband was the Obadiah of <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3-16</a>, but no dependence can be placed on it. Obadiah, the "governor of Ahab's house," can scarcely have been one of the "sons of the prophets." <span class="cmt_word">And the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to he bondmen.</span> In primitive communities, men borrowed upon their personal credit, and the primary security for debt was regarded as being their own persons, the value of their labor, and that of those dependent on them. In Greece and Rome, originally, as in the Hebrew community, borrowers ordinarily raised money by pledging their persons, and, if they could not pay when the debt became due, went into servitude with their children. The Mosaic Law presupposes this state of things, and permits its continuance, but in two respects interferes to modify it: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by requiring that the service exacted shall not be severe (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-43.htm">Leviticus 25:43, 46</a>), but such as was commonly rendered by hired servants (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 40</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by limiting the period of service to the date of the next jubilee year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus 25:40, 41</a>). In the instance brought here under our notice, it would seem that the creditor had not proceeded to claim his rights until the debtor died, when he on-forced them against the man's children (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1-8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house?

This is, no doubt, in part, because she is a widow. Widows were, in the Law, especially commended to the attention and care of the faithful. As Bahr says, "It is a well-known feature of the Mosaic Law, one which is distinctly prominent, that it often and urgently commands to succor the widows and the fatherless, and to care for them (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>).

It is especially emphasized and praised in Jehovah, that he is the Father and Judge (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Protector of the rights) of the widows and the fatherless (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-17.htm">Isaiah 9:17</a>, etc.).

(<a href="../../par/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16</a>; Tobit 1:7; <a href="../../par/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Elisha could also gather from the tone of the woman's address that she, like her late husband, was God-fearing. <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, what hast thou in the house?</span> Hast thou anything, that is, which thou canst soil, and so pay the debt? <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Thins handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil</span>; literally, <span class="accented">save an anointing of oil</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so much oil as will suffice for one anointing of my person.

Attention was not to be called to it - perhaps because otherwise the prophet would have been overwhelmed with applications from others; perhaps because the act was not a mere mechanical one, but required that, during its performance, the hearts of the woman and of her sons should be lifted up in prayer and adoration and thankfulness to God for the mercy which he was bestowing. Interruption from without would have interfered with the frame of mind which was befitting the occasion. Compare our Lord's secret performance of many miracles. <span class="cmt_word">And shalt pour out into all those vessels</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those which thou shalt have borrowed - <span class="cmt_word">and thou shalt set aside that which is full</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as each vessel is filled, it shall be removed and set aside, and one of the empty vessels substituted - that the pouring might be continuous.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-6.htm">2 Kings 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel.

If the oil had continued to flow, it would have fallen on the floor of the house, and have been of no service to any one. Therefore, when all the vessels were full, there was a sudden stoppage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then she came and told the man of God.

She did not feel entitled to make use of the oil which she had got by his instrumentality without first telling him and receiving his directions respecting it. The prophet gave them with all plainness and brevity. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.</span> The oil in the vessels was more than sufficient for the discharge of the debt. The prophet directs the woman to sell the whole, and, after satisfying the claim of her creditor with part of the money, to support herself and her children on the remainder. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where <i>was</i> a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread.

It occurs only here and in the opening chapters of the Book of Job (Job 1:6, 13; 2:1). The most literal rendering would be, <span class="accented">and the day came when</span>. Elisha passed to Shunem. Shunem was a village of Galilee, situated in the territory assigned to Issachar (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). It is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Solam</span>, at the south-eastern foot of the Gebel Duhy, or "Little Hermon," a "flourishing village encompassed by gardens" (Porter), and "in the midst of the finest corn-fields in the world" (Grove), on the edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. Elisha, in his progression to different parts of the northern kingdom, happened to come on one occasion to Shunem. <span class="cmt_word">Where was a great woman.</span> Houbigant strangely translates, "a tan woman," maintaining that a woman would not be called "great" in the sense of "wealthy" during her husband's lifetime; but no other commentator has accepted his view. The meaning seems to be that she was a woman of substance, one well-to-do, perhaps one that had brought her husband the bulk of his wealth. <span class="cmt_word">And she constrained him to eat bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she invited him in as he passed her house, and would take no denial. Compare Lot's pressing hospitality, as related in <a href="../../par/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</span> Elisha, it appears, had frequent occasion to pass through Shunem on his way from Carmel to visit the cities of Galilee, or <span class="accented">versa</span>. It became his habit, on these journeys, to eat his meals at the house of the rich Shunammite. Hence arose a kindly feeling on both sides and a close intimacy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-9.htm">2 Kings 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this <i>is</i> an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto her husband, Beheld now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God.</span> Not all the <span class="accented">soi-disant</span> men of God were truly religious and God-fearing. In Elisha's time, as in all others, there were among the teachers of religion some who were "wolves in sheep's clothing:' The Shunammite woman, after a certain length of acquaintance, came to the conclusion that Elisha deserved the title which he commonly bore, was truly a "man of God," a real devoted servant of Jehovah. She therefore wished to do more for him than she had hitherto done. <span class="cmt_word">Which passeth by us continually</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who passes through our village, and has his meals with us so frequently. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-10.htm">2 Kings 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall.</span> Thenius understands "a walled chamber," which he supposes to have been "built upon the flat roof of the house;" but it is more probable that a small addition to the existing upper chamber of the house is meant - a tiny room resting partly upon the wall of the house, partly projecting beyond it, balcony fashion. Such sleeping-chambers are common in Oriental dwellings. <span class="cmt_word">And let us set for him there a bed, aria a table, and a stool, and a candlestick</span>; raffler, <span class="accented">a bed</span>, <span class="accented">and a table</span>, <span class="accented">and a chair</span>, <span class="accented">and a lamp -</span> the necessary furniture of an apartment which was to be used, not only; as a sleeping-chamber, but also for retirement, for study, and perhaps for literary composition. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</span> In the intervals between his active ministrations, a prophet would naturally desire quiet retirement, security from interruption. He would need to reflect, to meditate, to pray, perhaps to write. The Shunammite's proposal shows, not only kindness, but thoughtfulness and appreciation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-11.htm">2 Kings 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> slept there, passed the night there.

He seems to have been Elisha's "servant" in a lower sense than Elisha had been Elijah's. Still, his position was such that on one occasion (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4, 5</a>) a king of Israel did not disdain to hold a conversation with him. <span class="cmt_word">Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him</span>; i.e. before Gehazi. Elisha communicates with the woman through his servant, or at any rate in his presence, probably to prevent any suspicion of impropriety arising in the mind of any one. The prophet of the Lord must not be evil spoken of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-13.htm">2 Kings 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what <i>is</i> to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?

Is there anything that we can do for thee in return? <span class="cmt_word">Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king?</span> Elisha assumes that he has credit at court, and offers to use it in the Shunammite's favor, if she has any request to prefer. We see something of his influence in <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9-12, 21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4-6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or to the captain of the host?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the person whose authority and influence was next to that of the king. <span class="cmt_word">And she answered, I dwell among mine own people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The court is nothing to me. I want nothing from it. I have no wrong to complain of, no quarrel with any of my neighbors, so as to need the help of one m power. I dwell peaceably among them. They are 'my own people' - friends or dependents." The reply is that of one perfectly content with her position. Perhaps she aims at impressing on Elisha that she has had no selfish motive in what she has done for him, but has merely wished to honor God in his prophet. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-14.htm">2 Kings 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, What then <i>is</i> to be done for her?

Has he heard her express any wish? Does he know of any boon that would be welcome to her? Evidently the woman's disinterestedness has increased the prophet's desire to do something for her. b It does not appear that the woman had made any complaint or exhibited any special anxiety on the subject of offspring. But Gehazi knows, that to be barren is regarded by all Hebrew women as a re-preach, that it exposes them to scorn and contumely (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6, 7</a>), and that offspring is universally, or all but universally, desired. He therefore assumes that the Shunammite must wish for it. And Elisha accepts his suggestion without a moment's hesitation.

Elijah had placed on his own bed the child whom he restored to life (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19</a>); and the fact may have been known to the Shunammite. She certainly did not expect mere contact with the bed to resuscitate her child. <span class="cmt_word">And shut the door upon him.</span> Either that the body should not be disturbed, or rather that the death should not be known. It is clear that, from whatever motive, the woman wished to conceal the death of the child until she had seen what Elisha could do for her.

It was not either "new moon" or "sabbath"  - times when evidently the prophets conducted services, which were attended by pious persons from the neighborhood: what could she want of Elisha? He had evidently no idea that the child was dead. Probably he had not realized to himself that he was in any danger. <span class="cmt_word">And she said, It shall be well.</span> She uttered the single word <span class="accented">shalom</span>, literally, "peace," but used, like the German <span class="accented">gut</span>, or the English "all right," to content an inquirer without giving him a definite answer.

It was not usual for his disciples to intrude upon him there, except at stated times, when gatherings were held at his residence for edification and for worship. <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off</span> - literally, over <span class="accented">against him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> coming towards him  (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite.</span> The prophet knew her at a distance, probably by her attire and carriage.

His anxiety is aroused, and, in his impatience to know what has happened, instead of waiting for the woman's arrival, he bids his servant run, and ask what is the matter. Some misfortune, he supposes, must have happened either to her, or to her husband, or to the child. <span class="cmt_word">And she answered, It is well.</span> She gave, as before to her husband (ver. 23), the ambiguous answer, "Peace," intending thereby merely to put off Gehazi, and not explain herself to any one but his master.

It has always been usual in the East to embrace the feet or the knees, in order to add force to supplication. <span class="cmt_word">But Gehazi came near to thrust her away.</span> He regarded the act as one unduly familiar or unduly importunate, and interfered to protect and release his master. <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her.</span> Elisha would not have the woman disturbed. He saw that she was in deep distress, and, if there was anything unseemly in her action according to the etiquette of the time, excused it to her profound grief and distraction. The ordinary mind is a slave to conventionalities; the superior mind knows when to be above them. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</span> God had not informed Elisha, by inward miraculous illumination, of the illness of the child, or its death, or the wild hopes stirring in the afflicted mother's mind, which induced her to make her long and troublesome journey. We need not feel surprised at this. There is always a limit to the miraculous; and facts that may be learnt by a little inquiry are but rarely communicated supernaturally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-28.htm">2 Kings 4:28</a></div><div class="verse">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</span> The woman does not directly reveal her grief. Great sorrow is reticent, cannot endure to put itself into words. But she sufficiently indicates the nature of her trouble by the form of her reproach. "Did I ask for a son? Did I make complaint of my childlessness? Had I been importunate, and obtained my son of thee by much asking, I would not have complained. But I did not ask. I did not even snatch greedily at the offer. I demurred. I said, 'Do not deceive me.' But now thou hast done worse than deceive me. Thou hast kept the word of promise to the ear, and broken it to the hope. It is greater misery to have a child and lose him, than never to have had one at all." All this, and more, seems to be involved in the woman's words. And the prophet fully understood their meaning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a></div><div class="verse">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Than he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again.</span> The object of all these injunctions is haste. Lose not a moment. Go as quickly as thou canst to the house where the child lies. Spend no time in greetings on the way. Slack not. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry not. And lay my staff upon the face of the child.</span> What effect the prophet expected from this act, we are not told. Gehazi appears to have expected that it would at once cause a resuscitation (ver. 31); but there is no evidence that the prophet participated in the expectation. He may have done so, for prophets are not infallible beyond the sphere of the revelations made to them; but he may only have intended to comfort and cheer the mother, and to raise in her an expectation of the resuscitation which he trusted it would be allowed him to effect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-30.htm">2 Kings 4:30</a></div><div class="verse">And the mother of the child said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.

But her own resolution was long ago taken - she would be content with nothing less than bringing the prophet face to face with her dead child. She "will not leave" him till he consents to accompany her to her home. <span class="cmt_word">And he arose, and followed her</span>; as, no doubt, he had intended from the first.

The child was not reused by the staff being placed across his face. All remained still and silent as before. Although on some occasions it has pleased God to allow miracles to be wrought by the instrumentality of lifeless objects, as when Elisha's hones resuscitated a dead man (<a href="../../par/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>), and when virtue went out from the hem of our Lord's garment (<a href="../../par/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>), and still more remarkably, when "handkerchiefs or aprons from the body of Paul were brought unto the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits were case out of them" (<a href="../../par/acts/19-12.htm">Acts 19:12</a>); yet the instances are, comparatively speaking, rare, and form exceptions to what may be called the usual Divine economy of miracles. Miracles are, as a general rule, attached in Scripture to intense unwavering faith - faith, sometimes, in those that are the objects of them, almost always in those that are the workers of them. The present case was not to be an exception to the general rule, the circumstances not calling for an exception. The power of faith was to be shown forth once more in Elisha, as not long previously in Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19-23</a>); and Israel was to be taught, by a second marvelous example, how much the effectual fervent prayer of a faithful and righteous man avails with the Most High. The lesson would have been lest had the staff been allowed to effect the resuscitation. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore he</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> Gehazi - <span class="cmt_word">went again to meet him</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> Elisha - <span class="cmt_word">and told him, saying, The child is not waked.</span> It is clear from this, that Gehazi had expected an awakening; but there is nothing to show what the prophet himself had expected. We are certainly not entitled to conclude, with Peter Martyr,' that "Elisha did wrong in attempting to 'delegate his power of working miracles to another;" or even, with Starke, that "Elisha gave the command to Gehazi from over haste, without having any Divine incentive to it."

And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot.</span> Either the bitter flavor alarmed them, or they began to feel ill effects from what they had swallowed, which, if it was colocynth, might very soon have produced stomachache or nausea. Rushing, therefore, at once to the worst possible supposition, they concluded that they were poisoned, and exclaimed, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" "If eaten in any large quantity," says Keil, "colocynths might really produce death." <span class="cmt_word">And they could not eat thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they could not continue to eat the pottage - all stopped eating. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-41.htm">2 Kings 4:41</a></div><div class="verse">But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast <i>it</i> into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he said, Then bring meal</span>. Elisha seems not to have hesitated for a moment. Prompt measures must be taken, if poisoning is even suspected. He has meal brought - not that meal has any virtue in itself against colocynth, or against any other deleterious drug. But he acts, now as always, under Divine direction, and is instructed to use meal on this occasion, as he used salt in healing the waters of Jericho. The meal, as Keil observes, "might somewhat modify the bitterness and injurious qualities of the vegetable," whatever it was, but "could not possibly take them entirely away.  The meal, the most wholesome food of man, was only the earthly substratum for the working of the Divine effluence which proceeded from Elisha, and made the noxious food perfectly wholesome." <span class="cmt_word">And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out now for the people</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the assembled company of sons of the prophets - <span class="cmt_word">that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</span> Such as had faith in Elisha, and continued to eat of the pottage, found no ill result. What they ate did them no harm. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a></div><div class="verse">And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42-44.</span> - 4. <span class="accented">The feeding of a hundred men on twenty loaves</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a man from Baal-shalisha.</span> "Baal-shalisha" is reasonably identified with the "Beth-shalisha" of Eusebius and Jerome, which they place twelve Roman miles north of Diospolis, or Lydda (now Ludd). By "north" we must probably understand "northeast," since the "land of Shalisha" lay between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>). The position thus indicated would not be very far from the Gilgal (<span class="accented">Jiljileh</span>) of <a href="../../par/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2</a>. and 2 Kings 4:38. <span class="cmt_word">And brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits.</span> It is clear that the more pious among the Israelites not only looked to the prophets for religious instruction (ver. 23), but regarded them as having inherited the position of the Levitical priests whom Jeroboam's innovations had driven from the country. The firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil were assigned by the Law (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4, 5</a>) to the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Twenty loaves of barley.</span> The "loaves" of the Israelites were cakes or rolls, rather than "loaves" in the modern sense of the word. Each partaker of a meal usually had one for himself. Naturally, twenty "loaves" would be barely sufficient for twenty men. <span class="cmt_word">And full ears of corn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a few ripe ears of the same corn as that whereof the bread was made. Ears of corn were offered as firstfruits at the Passover (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>), and were regarded as the most natural and becoming tokens of gratitude for God's harvest mercies. <span class="cmt_word">In the husk thereof</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his bag</span>, or <span class="accented">in his sack</span> (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Give unto the people</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the sons of the prophets who dwelt at Gilgal - <span class="cmt_word">that they may eat.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-43.htm">2 Kings 4:43</a></div><div class="verse">And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave <i>thereof</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?</span> The servant felt that the quantity was quite insufficient, and thought it absurd to invite a hundred men to sit down to a meal, which would not satisfy a fifth of the number; but Elisha repeated his command. <span class="cmt_word">He said again, Give the people, that they may eat.</span> This time, however, he added an explanation of the proceeding: <span class="cmt_word">for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.</span> God had supernaturally intimated to him that the quantity of food would prove ample for the hundred men; they would show that they had had enough by leaving some of it. And the result was as predicted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/4-44.htm">2 Kings 4:44</a></div><div class="verse">So he set <i>it</i> before them, and they did eat, and left <i>thereof</i>, according to the word of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord.</span> We are not expressly told how the miracle was wrought, whether by an augmentation of the quantity of the food supernaturally produced, or by a lessening of the appetites of the men, as Bahr supposes. But the analogy of our Lord's miracles of feeding the multitudes, whereof this is a manifest type, makes it probable that in this case also there was a miraculous increase of the food. The object of the writer in communicating the account is certainly not merely to show how the Lord cared for his servants, but to relate another miracle wrought by Elisha, of a different kind from those previously related. He is occupied with Elisha's miracles through this entire chanter and through the three next. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
