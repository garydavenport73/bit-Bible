Most of the seventy wore probably his grandsons (see ver. 3); some may have been great-grandsons. They lived in Samaria; since Samaria was the principal residence of the court, Jezreel being simply a country palace - the "Versailles," as it has been called, or "Windsor" of the Israelite kings. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel.</span> "Jezreel" is almost certainly a corrupt reading. The "rulers of Jezreel" would be at Jezreel; and, if Jehu wished to communicate with them, he would not need to "write." Had any chance taken them to Samaria - a very improbable circumstance  - they would have had no authority there, and to address them would have been useless. John's letters were, no doubt, addressed <span class="accented">to the rulers of Samaria</span>; and so the LXX. expressly state (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but the reading "Jezreel" can scarcely have arisen out of "Samaria" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> out of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), since the difference of the two words is so great. Most probably the original word was "Israel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>), which is easily corrupted into "Jezreel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>).

There is no public post. Kings and private individuals must equally find persons who will undertake to carry and deliver their despatches. Even the post organized by Darius Hystaspis was not one that went daily, but only one kept ready for the king to use when he had occasion for it. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing your master's sons are with you.</span> "Your master's sons" must mean Joram's sons; by which we learn that, unlike his brother Ahaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>), Joram had male offspring who survived him, and were now with the rest of Ahab's descendants, at Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the chariots</span>, <span class="accented">and the horses</span>, <span class="accented">a fenced city also</span>, <span class="accented">and the armor</span>. The main chariot force of the country, and the chief arsenal, containing both armor and arms, were naturally at Samaria, the capital, and might thus be regarded as at the disposition of the Samaritan municipality. Jehu scornfully challenges them to make use of their resources against him. He is quite ready for a contest. Let them do their worst. The LXX. have "fenced cities" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) instead of "a fenced city;" but the existing Hebrew text is probably right Samaria was the only fortified town in their possession. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-3.htm">2 Kings 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set <i>him</i> on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look even out the belt and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne.</span> "Choose," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "among the sons of Joram the strongest, the boldest, and the ablest, and make him king in his father's zoom; take him for your leader against me; do not hesitate and beat about the bush; but at once make up your minds, and let me know what I have to expect." <span class="cmt_word">And fight for your master's house.</span> There had been a civil war before the dynasty of Omri succeeded in settling itself on the throne (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-21.htm">1 Kings 16:21, 22</a>). Jehu believes, or affects to believe, that there will now be another. He does not deprecate it, but invites it. Probably he felt tolerably confident that the garrison of Samaria, even if called upon by the municipality, would not venture to take up arms against the army of Ramoth-Gilead, which had declared itself in his favor. Still, supposing that it did, he was not fearful of the result. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-4.htm">2 Kings 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But they wore exceedingly afraid.</span> They were men of peace, not men of war - accustomed to discharge the duties of judges and magistrates, not of commandants and generals. They could not count on the obedience even of the troops in Samaria, much less on that of any others who might be in garrison elsewhere. They would naturally have been afraid of taking up arms under almost any circumstances. What, however, caused them now such excessive fear was probably the tone which Jehu had adopted - his "scornful challenge," as it has been called. He evidently entertained no fear himself. He dared them to do that which he pretended to recommend them to do. They must have felt that he was laughing at them in his sleeve. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</span> The kings intended are Joram and Ahaziah, who had confronted Jehu, and had met their deaths. What were they that they should succeed where "two kings" had failed? The argument was fallacious, and a mere cloak for cowardice. The two kings had been taken by surprise, and treacherously murdered. Their fate could prove nothing concerning the probable issue of a civil war, had the "princes" ventured to commence it. It must be admitted, however, that the chance of success was but slight.

The "governor" of a town was assisted by a council of elders. <span class="cmt_word">And the bringers up of the children</span> (see the comment on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do sit that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king.</span> Jehu's letter had the effect which he intended, of making the authorities of Samaria declare themselves. They might, perhaps, have temporized, have sent an ambiguous answer, or have sent no answer at all, and have let their action be guided by the course of events. But, taken aback by Jehu's directness and plainness of speech, it did not occur to them to be diplomatic; they felt driven into a corner, and compelled to make their choice at once. Either they must resist Jehu in arms or they must submit to him. If they submitted, they had best (they thought) do it with a good grace. Accordingly, his letter produced a reply, more favorable than he can possibly have expected - "They were his servants," or "his slaves," ready to do all his pleasure; they would not set up a king, or in any way dispute his succession; they submitted themselves wholly to his will. <span class="cmt_word">Do thou</span> [they said] that which is <span class="cmt_word">good in thine eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "take what steps thou pleasest to confirm thyself in the kingdom."

The reply of the Samaritan authorities gave Jehu an opportunity, of which he was not slow to take advantage. They might have been contented with their negative response, "We will not make any man king;" but they had gone beyond it - they had departed from the line of neutrality, and had placed themselves unreservedly on Jehu's side. "We are thy servants," they had said, "and will do all that thou shalt bid us." It is always rash to promise absolute obedience to a human being. To volunteer such a promise, when it is not even asked, is the height of folly. <span class="cmt_word">If ye be mine</span> - as they had said they were, when they called themselves his "slaves" - <span class="cmt_word">and if ye will hearken unto my voice</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, obey me, do as I require - <span class="cmt_word">take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel.</span> The Samaritan authorities were ordered to bring the heads with them, that they might be seen and counted. In the East generally, the heads of rebels and pretenders, by whatever death they may have died, are cut off, brought to the sovereign, and then exposed in some public place, in order that the public at large may be certified that the men are really dead (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By tomorrow this time.</span> As Jezreel was not more than about twenty miles from Samaria, the order could be executed by that time. It necessitated, however, very prompt measures, and gave the authorities but little time for consideration. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up (comp. ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-7.htm">2 Kings 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him <i>them</i> to Jezreel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons.</span> Having committed themselves by their answer to Jehu's first letter, the Samaritan great men seemed to themselves to have no choice, on receiving his second, but to allow themselves to become the tools and agents of his policy. They accordingly put the seventy princes to death without any hesitation, though they can scarcely have done so without reluctance. <span class="cmt_word">And put their heads in baskets.</span> Thus concealing their bloody deed as long as they could. In the Assyrian sculptures, those who slay the king's enemies carry the heads openly in their hands, as though glorying in what they have done. <span class="cmt_word">And sent him them to Jezreel.</span> Jehu had bidden them to bring the heads to him; but this was a degradation to which they did not feel bound to submit.

"The gate" was also a general place of assembly for the gossips of the town and others, who would soon spread the news, and bring together a crowd of persons, curious to see so unusual a sight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-9.htm">2 Kings 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye <i>be</i> righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous.</span> Not an ironical reproach to those who had brought the heads - "Ye consider yourselves righteous, yet this bloodshed rests upon you;" much less a serious declaration (Gerlach) that now at last the sins of idolatrous Israel were atoned for; but an argument ad captandum, addressed to the crowd of spectators whom the unwonted spectacle had brought together, "Ye are just persons, and capable of pronouncing a just judgment; judge, then, if I am the wicked person which men generally consider me." <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</span> I confess to one murder; but here are seventy murders. And who is guilty of them? Not I, or my party, but the trusted adherents of the Ahabite dynasty, the rulers placed by them over the capital, and the governors to whom they had entrusted the royal children. Does not this show that all parties are weary of the Ahabites and of their system? Does it not clear me of any private or selfish motive, and indicate the desire of the whole nation for a change, civil and religions - a change which shall entirely subvert the new religion introduced by Jezebel, and fall back upon the lines of that maintained by Elijah and Elisha?

The whole house of Ahab would perish - it would be made like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>), and its adherents would share its fate. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "has requited Ahab in the portion of Jezreel; has caused dogs to eat the flesh of Jezebel; and has begun the destruction of his house.

Encouraged by his past success, having killed Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Jezebel, having secured the adhesion of the chief men in Samaria, and effected the destruction of all those who might naturally have claimed the succession and involved him in civil war, Jehu proceeded to greater lengths. He "slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel" - the princesses probably, as well as the princes - and further put to death all the leading partisans of the dethroned dynasty, the "great men," perhaps even those who had worked his bloody will at Samaria, and the intimate friends and supporters of the house - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, as they are here called - not relatives, but "intimate acquaintances." <span class="cmt_word">And his priests.</span> This expression causes a difficulty, since the destruction of the Baal-priests is related subsequently (vers. 19-25).

But this signification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is scarcely an ascertained one.

Jehonadab is mentioned only here and in the passage of Jeremiah just quoted; but it is evident that he was an important personage. His tribe, the Kenites, was probably of Arab origin, and certainly of Arab habits. It attached itself to the Israelites during their wanderings in the Sinaitic desert, and was given a settlement in "the wilderness of Judah," on the conquest of Palestine (<a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>). Jehonadab seems to have been of an ascetic turn, and to have laid down for his tribe a rule of life stricter and more severe than any known previously. He required them not merely to dwell in tents, and, unless under the compulsion of war, never to enter cities, but also to abstain wholly from the use of wine, and to have neither house, nor field, nor vineyard (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Jeremiah 35:8-10</a>). Gautama, between three and four centuries later, enjoined a somewhat similar rule upon his disciples. It is indicative of much strength of character in either case, that so strict a rule was accepted, adopted, and acted upon for centuries. On the present occasion, Jehu, it would seem, desired the sanction of Jehonadab to the proceedings upon which he was about to enter, as calculated to legitimate them in the eyes of some who might otherwise have regarded them with disapproval. Jehonadab had, no doubt, the influence which is always wielded by an ascetic in Oriental countries. <span class="cmt_word">Coming to meet him.</span> This expression tells us nothing of Jehonadab's intent. The meeting may have been merely a chance one. <span class="cmt_word">And he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</span> literally, <span class="accented">he blessed him</span>; but the word used (<span class="accented">barak</span>) has frequently the sense of "to salute" (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-10.htm">1 Samuel 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>, etc.). Jehu's inquiry was made to assure himself of Jehonadab's sympathy, on which no doubt he counted, but whereof he was glad to receive a positive promise. Jehonadab must have been known as a zealous servant of Jehovah, and might therefore be assumed to be hostile to the house of Ahab. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehonadab answered, It is.</span> Unhesitatingly, without a moment's pause, without the shadow of a doubt, the Kenite chief cast in his lot with the revolutionist. Heart and soul he would join him in an anti-Ahab policy. <span class="cmt_word">If it he, Give me thine hand.</span> The Hebrews did not clench agreements, like the Greeks and Romans, by grasping each other's hands. Jehu merely means to say, "If this is so, if thou art heart and. soul with me in the matter, put out thy hand, and I will take thee into my chariot." Jehu intended at once to do honor to the Kenite chief, and to strengthen his own position by being seen to be so familiar with him. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehonadab - <span class="cmt_word">gave him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehu - <span class="cmt_word">his hand</span>; <span class="cmt_word">and he took him up to him into the chariot.</span> There was always room in a chariot for at least three or four persons - the charioteer and the owner of the chariot in front, and one or two guards behind.

Probably, as yet, no suspicion had touched the public mind that Jehu would be a less zealous worshipper of Baal than his predecessor. The outburst against Jezebel's "whoredoms" and "witchcrafts" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>) would be known to few, and might not have been understood as a condemnation of the entire Baalistic system. The "zeal for Jehovah" whispered in the ear of Jehonadab (ver. 16) had been hitherto kept secret. Thus there was nothing to prevent the multitude from giving implicit credence to the proclamation now made, and looking to see the new reign inaugurated by a magnificent and prolonged festival in honor of the two great Phoenician deities, Baal the sun-god, and Ashtoreth or Astarte the famous "Dea Syra" Such festivals were frequently held in Phoenicia and the rest of Syria, often lasting over many days, and constituting a time of excitement, feasting, and profligate enjoyment, which possessed immense attraction for the great mass of Asiatics.

The Egyptians called the priest <span class="accented">ab</span>, the prophet <span class="accented">neter hen</span>, literally, "servant of <span class="accented">God</span>." They held the priest in the greater honor. In Phoenicia, on the contrary, judging from the scanty notices that we possess, prophets appear to have taken precedence of priests, and to have had the more important functions assigned to them (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let none be wanting</span> - literally, <span class="accented">let not a man fail - <span class="cmt_word"></span>for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal.</span> Like the other gods of the heathen, Baal and Ashtoreth were worshipped chiefly by sacrifice.

In the greater festivals several hundreds of victims were offered; and their flesh was served up at the banquets by which the festivals were accompanied. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.</span> His absence would be regarded as an act of contumacy verging on rebellion, and so as deserving of capital punishment. <span class="cmt_word">But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</span> "Subtilty" was characteristic of John, who always preferred to gain his ends by cunning rather than in a straightforward way. Idolaters were by the Law liable to death, and Jehu would have had a perfect right to crush the Baal-worship throughout the land, by sending his emissaries everywhere, with orders to slay all whom they found engaged in it. But to draw some thousands of his subjects by false pretences into a trap, and then to kill them in it for doing what he had himself invited them to do, was an act that was wholly unjustifiable, and that savored, not of the wisdom which is from above, but of that bastard wisdom which is "earthly, sensual, devilish" (<a href="../../par/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>). Jehu's religious reformation did not succeed, and it was conducted in such a way that it did not deserve to succeed. A little more honest boldness, and a little less frequent resort to subterfuge and craft, might have had a different result, and have been better both for himself and for his people.

That he should have thought such a thing possible or even probable indicates the general laxity of the time, and the want of any sharp line of demarcation between the adherents of the two religions. He cleverly masked his desire for the safety of his own religionists under a show of keen anxiety that the coming ceremonies should not be profaned by the presence of scoffers or indifferent persons.

With whatever intent the worship had been set up by its author, the curse of God had been pronounced against it by the chief prophet of the time (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), and his word had been attired as from heaven by two miracles (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4, 5</a>). Jehu ought to have known that the calf-worship, if not as hateful to God as the Baal-worship, at any rate was hateful, was a standing act of rebellion against Jehovah, and laid the nation under his displeasure. But, while his own interests were entirely detached from the one, they were, or at least would seem to him to be, bound up with the other. The calf-worship was thought to be essential to the matureance of the divided kingdom. Abolish it, and all Israel would "return to the house of David" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-30</a>). Jehu was not prepared to risk this result. His "zeal for Jehovah" did not reach so far. Thus his "reformation of religion" was but a half-reformation, a partial turning to Jehovah, which brought no permanent blessing upon the nation. To wit, <span class="cmt_word">the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</span> The erection of the calves (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>) was the initial sin, their worship the persistent one. (On the nature of the calf-worship, see the comment on 1 Kings 12:28, and compare the 'Speaker's Commentary' on the same passage.)

No other Israelite dynasty held the throne longer than three generations, or for so much as fifty years. The "children" or descendants of Jehu who sat upon the throne after him were Jehoahaz, his son, Jehoash or Joash, his grandson, Jeroboam II., his great-grandson, and Zachariah, son of Jeroboam II., his great-great-grandson

He is exactly one of those men whom we are compelled to recognize, not for what is good or great in themselves, but as instruments for destroying evil, and preparing the way for good; such as Augustus Caesar at Rome, Sultan Mahmoud II. in Turkey, or one closer at hand in the revolutions of our own time and neighborhood. A destiny, long kept in view by himself or ethers - inscrutable secrecy and reserve in carrying out his plans - a union of cold, remorseless tenacity with occasional bursts of furious, wayward, almost fanatical zeal;  - this is Jehu, as he is set before us in the historical narrative, the worst type of a son of Jacob - the 'supplanter'...without the noble and princely qualities of Israel; the most unlovely and the most coldly commended of all the heroes of his country" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 289). The estimate is lower than that formed by most other writers; but it is not far from the truth. <span class="cmt_word">For he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. ver. 29). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a></div><div class="verse">In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32-36.</span> <span class="accented">- Jehu's wars</span>, <span class="accented">length of reign</span>, <span class="accented">and successor</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days the Lord began to out Israel short.</span> It is certainly not stated in direct terms that the ill success of Jehu's foreign wars was a punishment on him for his continued maintenance of the calf-idolatry; but the juxtaposition of vers. 31 and 32 naturally raises the idea, and constitutes a strong presumption that it was in the writer's mind. The "theocracy" under the kings was carried on mainly, as the writer of Chronicles clearly saw, by the bestowal of worldly prosperity and military success on good kings, and the accumulation of misfortunes and military disasters on bad ones (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2-15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2-15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-5</a>. etc.). By "cutting Israel short" - literally, "cutting off in Israel" - is probably meant the conquest of certain portions of the territory. Hazael resumed the war which Benhadad had so long waged, and gained numerous successes. <span class="cmt_word">And Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel</span>; or, <span class="accented">along their whole frontier</span> (Bahr). The frontier intended is, of course, that on the north and east, where the Israelite territory was conterminous with that of Syria.

The region comprised <span class="cmt_word">all the land of Gilead</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the more southern region, reaching from the borders of Moab on the south to the Hieromax or Sheriat-el-Mandhur upon the north, the proper land of the <span class="cmt_word">Gadites, and the Reubenites, and</span> [a portion of] <span class="cmt_word">the Manassites</span> - together with Bashan, the more northern region, which belonged wholly to Manasseh - <span class="cmt_word">from Aroer</span> (now Arair), <span class="cmt_word">which is by the river Arnon</span> - the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Mojeb</span>, which was the boundary between Israel and Moab (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13, 24</a>), both in the earlier and (<a href="../../par/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>) in the later times - <span class="cmt_word">even Gilead and Bashan.</span> There is other evidence, besides this, that Hazael was one of the most warlike of the Syrian kings. We find him, on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II., mentioned as a stubborn adversary of the Assyrian arms. In the seventeenth campaign of Shalmaneser, a great battle was fought between the two monarchs. Hazael brought into the field more than twelve hundred chariots, but was defeated, and obliged to retreat, his camp falling into the hands of the enemy ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 84). Four years later Shalmaneser invaded Hazael's territory, and took, according to his own account (ibid., p. 35), four cities or fortresses belonging to him. He does not claim, however, to have made him a tributary; and By his later annals it is evident that he avoided further contest, preferring to turn his arms in other directions. (On Hazael's campaign in Philistia, and designs against Jerusalem, see the comment upon <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17, 18</a>,)

"Might" has been ascribed by the writer of Kings only to Baasha and Omri among previous Israelite monarchs, and only to Asa and Jehoshaphat among previous Jewish ones. "<span class="accented">All</span> his might" has only been used of Asa.
