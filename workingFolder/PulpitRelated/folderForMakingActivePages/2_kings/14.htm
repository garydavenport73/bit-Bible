All the others had fallen short more or less; and Amaziah fell short in many respects. He was wanting in "a perfect heart" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fixed intention to do God's will; he was proud and boastful (ver. 10); he gave way to idolatry in his later years (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>), and he despised the reproof of the prophet who was sent to rebuke his sin (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-16.htm">2 Chronicles 25:16</a>). Though placed among the "good kings' by the authors of both Kings and Chronicles, it is, as it were, under protest, with a distinct intimation that, although better than most of his predecessors, he did not reach a high standard. <span class="cmt_word">He did according to all things as Joash his father did.</span> There is something of Oriental hyperbole in this statement, which must be understood in the spirit, not in the letter. The two kings were differently circumstanced, and history did not "repeat itself" in their reigns. The position of Joash with respect to Jehoiada finds no parallel in the circumstances of the life of Amaziah. Still, the lives are parallel to some extent. Both kings began better than they ended. Both were zealous for Jehovah at first, but turned to idolatry at last. Both opposed themselves to prophets, and treated their rebukes with scorn. Both reused conspiracy against them by their misconduct, and were murdered by the malcontents. Further, both were unsuccessful in war, had to withstand a siege of their capital, and bought off their enemy by the surrender of the greater part of its wealth, including the treasures of the temple (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> with <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>).

Even Asa did not remove them (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>). They were remnants of an old ancestral worship which went back to the time of the judges, and which had been connived at by judges and kings and prophets. Local feeling was everywhere in their favor, since they provided for local needs, and enabled men to dispense with the long] and tedious journey to the distant Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places</span>; literally, <span class="accented">were sacrificing and burning incense</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> continued the practice, which had come down to them from their ancestors. (On the morality and legality of the practice, see the comment on 1 Kings 3:2.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand.</span> Joash had been murdered in Jerusalem by conspirators (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>). A time of trouble had, no doubt, supervened. The conspirators would not wish to see Amaziah placed upon the throne, and may have opposed and delayed his appointment. But their efforts proved fruitless. After a time, the young king was confirmed (literally, "strengthened"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> settled and established in his kingdom, all opposition being overcome or dying away. This seems to be what the writer means. He cannot intend a confirmation by a foreign suzerain, which the phrase used might import (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>), when he has given no hint of any subjection of the kingdom to any foreign power, or indeed of any serious attack on its independence. <span class="cmt_word">That he slew his servants.</span> Jozachar and Jehozabad were "servants" of Joash, apparently domestic servants employed in his palace, and are therefore reckoned "servants" also of his successor. <span class="cmt_word">Which had slain the king his father.</span> In the "house of Millo,' where he lay sick.

A Greek poet went so far as to say that a man was a fool who put to death the father, and allowed the son to live. The practice had a double ground. Sons, it might be assumed, would be cognizant of their father's intention, and would so be accessories before the fact. And the law of <span class="accented">claim</span>, or "blood-feud," would make it dangerous to spare them, since they would be bound to avenge their father's death on his destroyer. That the practice prevailed among the Israelites appears from <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>, where we find the children of Achan involved in his fate, and again from <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>, where we are told that Naboth's sons suffered with their father.

In either case the passage is fatal to the theory of the late' composition of Deuteronomy, which is here found to have ruled the conduct of a Jewish king a hundred and fifty years before Manasseh, two hundred before Josiah, and two hundred and eighty before the return from the Captivity - the dates assigned to Deuteronomy by recent "advanced" critics. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> As usual, when one sacred writer quotes another, the quotation is not exact. "But" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) is inserted at the beginning of the final clause, and the form of the verb in the same clause is modified. It seems to be intended that we should be made to feel that it is the sentiment or meaning conveyed, and not the phraseology in which it is wrapped up, that is of importance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand.</span> Edom had revolted from Judah and recovered complete independence in the reign of Jehoram, about fifty years previously (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>). Since that time the two countries had remained at peace. Now, however, Amaziah resolved upon a great effort to resubjugate them. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 1) and Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), he levied an army of 400,000 men - 300,000 Jews, and 100,000 hired Israelites - with which he marched against the three nations of the Amalekites, the Idumaeans, and the Gabalites. Rebuked by a prophet for want of faith in calling to his aid the wicked Israelites, he consented to dismiss them, and made the invasion at the head of his own troops only. These were carefully organized (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), and met with a great success. Ten thousand of his enemies fell in battle, and an equal number were made prisoners. These last were barbarously put to death by being precipitated from the top of a rock (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-12.htm">2 Chronicles 25:12</a>). "The valley of salt," the scene of the battle, is probably identified with the sunken plain, now called <span class="accented">Es Sabkah</span>, at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. This is "a large flat of at least six miles by ten, occasionally flooded" (Tristram), but dry in the summertime. It is full of salt springs, and is bounded on the west and northwest by a long ridge of pure salt, known as the <span class="accented">Khasm Usdum</span>, so that the name "valley of salt" would be very appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">And took Selah by war.</span> Selah with the article (<span class="accented">has-Selah</span>) can only be the Idumaean capital, which the Greeks called Petra (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and which is one of the most remarkable sites in the world. In the rocky mountains which form the eastern boundary of the Arabah or sandy slope reaching from the edge of the Sabkah to the Red Sea, amid cliffs of gorgeous colors, pink and crimson and purple, and ravines as deep and narrow as that of Proffers, partly excavated in the rook, partly emplaced upon it, stood the Edomite town, difficult to approach, still more difficult to capture, more like the home of a colony of sea-gulls than that of a number of men. Petra is graphically described by Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 88-92), and has also received notice from Robinson ('Researches,' vol. it. pp. 518-538), Highten ('Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 3. p. 1191), and others. <span class="cmt_word">And called the name of it Joktheel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "subdued by God." The name took no permanent hold. Selah is still "Sela" in Isaiah (Isaiah 16:1), Obadiah (ver. Obadiah 1:3), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:16). It is known only as "Petra" to the Greeks and Romans. <span class="cmt_word">Unto this day</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the time of the writer who composed the account of Amaziah's reign for the 'Book of the Kings,' and whoso words the author of Kings transcribes here as so often elsewhere. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, King of Israel, saying.</span> Amaziah had a cause of complaint against Jehoash, or at any rate against his subjects, which does not appear in the narrative of Kings. The author of Chronicles tells us that, when Amaziah dismissed his Israelite mercenaries, they were offended, and vented their anger by an inroad into his territories (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-13.htm">2 Chronicles 25:13</a>), where they killed three thousand men and "took much spoil." This was a clear casus <span class="accented">belli</span>, if Amaziah chose to consider it such. <span class="cmt_word">Come, let us look one another in the face.</span> A rude message, if it was actually couched in these terms. But perhaps the writer substitutes the gist of the message for the language in which it was wrapped up. Josephus says that Amaziah wrote a letter to Joash, and required him to submit himself and people to the authority of the Jewish state, and thus restore the state of things which had existed under David and Solomon. Otherwise the sword must decide between them ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 2). Whatever its terms, pride and self-confidence, the result of his success against Edom, were at the root of the challenge. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash the King of Israel sent to Amaziah King of Judah, saying.</span> According to Josephus, the reply to the challenge was given in a formal letter, of which he presents us with a copy-  King Joash to King Amaziah [sends greeting]: Once upon a time there was in Mount Lebanon a very tall cypress, and also there was a thistle. And the thistle sent to the cypress, saying,' Contract thy daughter in marriage to my son.' And while this was transacting, a wild beast passed by and trod down the thistle. Let this be a warning to thee not to cherish immoderate desires, and not, because thou hast had success against Amalek, to pride thyself thereupon, and so draw down dangers both upon thee and upon thy kingdom." The force of the original message is much weakened in this paraphrase. <span class="cmt_word">The thistle that was in Lebanon.</span> "Thistle" is a better translation than "thorn-bush" (Keil), first, as a meaner, growth, and secondly, as more likely to be trodden down by a wild beast. The monarch intends to say that the meanest thing in the vegetable world sent to the grandest, claiming equality. <span class="cmt_word">Sent to the cedar</span> - certainly "the cedar." and not "the cypress," as translated by Josephus - <span class="cmt_word">that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife.</span> <span class="accented">Nube pari</span> was a Roman maxim; and the rule was one generally established throughout the ancient world.

Its position is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Ain-Shems</span>, which lies nearly due west of Jerusalem, on the road from Hebron to Jaffa. Ain-Shems itself is an Arab village, but "just to the west of it are the manifest traces of an ancient site" (Robinson, 'Researches,' vol. 3. p. 17). The position commands the approach from the Philistine plain; and we may suspect that Joash, avoiding the direct line of approach, led his troops to the attack through Philistia, as was so often done by the Syrians in their attacks on the Maccabees (see 1 Macc. 3:40 1 Macc. 13:12, 13 1 Macc. 15:40 1 Macc. 16:4-8, etc.).

It is more likely to have sprung out of dissatisfaction with Amaziah's military inaction from and after his defeat by Joash. While Jeroboam H. was carrying all before him in the north, recovering his border, pushing it as far as Hamath, and even exercising a suzerainty over Damascus (vers. 25, 28), Amaziah remained passive, cowed by his one defeat, and took no advantage of the state of weakness to which he had reduced Edom, but sat with folded hands, doing nothing. The conspirators who removed Amaziah, and placed his son Azariah, or Uzziah, upon the throne, may be credited with the wish and intention to bring the period of inaction to an end, and to effect in the south what Jeroboam was effecting in the north. It is true that Azariah was but sixteen years of age (ver. 21; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>), but he may have given indications of his ambition and capacity. Sixteen, moreover, is the time of manhood in the East, and the conspirators had probably waited until Azariah was sixteen in order that his competency to reign should not be disputed. As soon as he was on the throne he initiated the warlike policy which they desired (see ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And he fled to Lachish.</span> Lachish, one of the south-western Judaean towns (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), was at all times a fortress of importance. It resisted Joshua (Joshua 10:3, 31), and was taken by storm. It was fortified by Jeroboam against the Egyptians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>). It was besieged and taken by Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152).

The difference between them is not so great in the Hebrew, where they both begin with the same letter; but still it is considerable. One name is not a mere contraction of the other. Some suppose that the king changed one name for the other upon his accession; others, that he was called indifferently by either, since they were very similar in meaning. "Azariah" is "he whose help is Jehovah;" "Uzziah," "he whose strength is Jehovah." "Uzziah" is the predominant form, occurring four times in 2 Kings, twelve times in 2 Chronicles, three times in Isaiah, once in Hoses, once in Amos, and once in Zechariah; while "Azariah" occurs only in 2 Kings (eight times) and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> (once). Josephus uses the form "Ozias" (equivalent to, Uzziah), and so does St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8, 9</a>).

The repetition is perhaps to be accounted for by the desire of the writer to explain how it came to pass that so great a deliverance was granted to Israel under a king who maintained the worship of the calves. He views it as the consequence of God's infinite compassion, and of the extreme bitterness of Israel's sufferings under the Syrians (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a> and <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For there was not any shut up, nor any left</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 14:10), <span class="cmt_word">nor any helper for Israel.</span> Apart from Jehovah, Israel had no one to come to her aid.

But there does not seem to be any sufficient reason for giving the words used this narrow signification. Damascus was conquered and annexed by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), and held for a time even by Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), of whose kingdom Hamath also seems to have formed part (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>). The word "recovered" is, therefore, a suitable one. The prophecy of Amos, no doubt, represents Damascus as independent (<a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3, 4</a>); but this may have been written before Jeroboam conquered it. Hamath's subjection seems to be implied in <a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2, 14</a>. We may, therefore, well understand, with Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 124) and Dr. Pusey ('Minor Prophets,' pp, 157, 209), that Jeroboam . ' subdued Damascus and even <span class="accented">Hamath</span>," and added them to his kingdom. How long the subjection continued is a different question. Probably, in the troubles that followed the death of Zachariah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10-14</a>), the yoke was thrown off. In the Assyrian Inscriptions, Damascus appears under its own king about  <span class="date">B.C. 786</span> (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 115), and it was certainly independent in  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>.
