Either, therefore, Azariah must have begun to reign in the fifteenth year of Jeroboam, or there must have been an interregnum of twelve years between the death of Amaziah and the accession of Azariah. As this last hypothesis is pre-eluded by the narrative of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-20.htm">2 Kings 14:20, 21</a>, we must correct the, twenty-seventh year" of this verse into the "fifteenth."

Josephus uses still stronger expressions. "Azariah was," he says (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>), "a good king, naturally just and high-minded, and indefatigable in his administration of affairs." According to the author of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>), he "sought God in the days of Zechariah."

We have to go to Chronicles for an explanation. By Chronicles it appears that, in the earlier portion of his reign, Azariah was a good and pious prince, and that God blessed him in all his undertakings. Not only did he recover Eloth (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-2.htm">2 Chronicles 26:2</a>), but he carried on a successful war with the Philistines - took Garb, Jabneh (Jamnia), and Ashdod, and dismantled them (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), defeated the Arabians of Gur-Baal, and the Mehuuim or Maonites (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a>), forced the Ammonites to pay him a tribute, and caused his power to be known and feared far and wide (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>). The standing army which he maintained numbered 307,500 men, under 2600 officers, well armed and equipped with shields, spears, helmets, breast-plates, bows, and slings (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12-14</a>). "His name spread far abroad, for he was wonderfully helped" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>). This marvelous prosperity developed in him a pride equal to that of his father, but one which vented itself differently, Azariab, deeming himself superior to all other men, and exempt from ordinary rules, boldly invaded the priestly office, took a censer, and entered into the temple, and proceeded to burn incense upon the golden altar that was before the veil (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-18</a>). It was then that "the Lord smote the king." As, in defiance of the high priest and his attendant train, who sought to prevent the lawless act, Azariah persisted in his endeavors, God struck him with leprosy, his forehead grew white with the unmistakable scaly scab, and in a moment his indomitable pride was quelled. The priests closed in upon him and began to thrust him out, but no violence was necessary. Aware of what had happened, "he himself also hasted to go out, because the Lord had smitten him" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>). It is not very clear why the writer of Kings passes over these facts; but certainly they are not discredited by his silence. At any rate, those who accept the entire series of conquests, whereof the writer of Kings says nothing, on the sole authority of Chronicles, are logically precluded from rejecting the circumstances accompanying the leprosy, which is acknowledged by the writer of Kings, and viewed as a judgment from God. <span class="cmt_word">So that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>). Lepers had to be separated from the congregation - to "dwell alone" - "without the camp" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). Ahaziah's "several house" is regarded by some as an "infirmary," or "hospital for lepers" (Ewald, Gesenius, Winer); but there is no reason to believe that hospitals of any kind existed among the Israelites. The lepers mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-3.htm">2 Kings 7:3</a> are houseless. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> is best translated "house of separation" and understood of a house standing by itself in the open country, separate from others. "Probably the house in which the leprous king lived was," as Bahr says, "especially built for him." <span class="cmt_word">And Jotham the Mug's son was over the house</span> - not over the "several house," but over the royal palace - <span class="cmt_word">judging the people of the land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> executing the royal functions, whereof "judging" was one of the highest. Azariah's infirmity made a regency necessary, and naturally his eldest son held the office.

Azariah, he tells us (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-23.htm">2 Chronicles 26:23</a>), was not buried in the rock-sepulcher which contained the bodies of the other kings, but in another part of the field wherein the sepulcher was situated. This was quite consonant with Jewish feeling with respect to the uncleanness of the leper. <span class="cmt_word">And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</span> Jotham, already for some years prince regent, became king as a matter of course on his father's demise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8</a></div><div class="verse">In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-12.</span> - REIGN OF ZACHARIA OVER ISRAEL. FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE JEHU. The writer has nothing to record of Zachariah but his murder by Shallum after a reign of six months. Vers. 8, 9, and 11 contain the usual formula. Ver. 10 gives the only event that needed record. Ver. 12 recalls to the reader's attention a previous passage, in which a prophecy had been mentioned, whereof Zachariah's reign was the fulfillment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah King of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria.</span> If Azariah began to reign in the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam (ver. 1), and Jeroboam died in his forty-first or forty-second year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>), Zachariah must have ascended the throne in the fifteenth or sixteenth year of Azariah. Even if Azariah became king in the fifteenth of Jeroboam, as has been shown to be probable (see the comment on ver. 1), Zachariah's accession cannot have been earlier than Azariah's twenty-sixth year. An interregnum between the death of Jeroboam and the accession of Zachariah is not to be thought cf. <span class="cmt_word">Six months</span>. So also Josephus (see 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:11. &sect; 1).

Ewald sought to solve the difficulty by inventing a king, "Zobolam," but other critics have found this expedient too bold. The rendering of our translators is generally accepted, though <span class="accented">qobal</span>, "before," only occurs here and in Daniel. If we accept this rendering, we must suppose that the act of violence was done openly, like Jehu's murder of Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">And slew him, and reigned in his stead</span> (comp. ver. 13).

There had not been wanting other indications of the coming troubles. Hosea had declared that God would avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu (<a href="../../par/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>). Amos had gone further, and had openly proclaimed that God would "rise against the house of Jeroboam <span class="accented">with the sword"</span> (<a href="../../par/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>). The threat had been understood as a threat against Jeroboam himself (<a href="../../par/amos/7-11.htm">Amos 7:11</a>), but this was a misinterpretation. The words plainly pointed, to a revolution in the time of his son. <span class="cmt_word">And so it came to pass.</span> The house of Jehu ceased to reign in the fourth generation of the descendants of its founder. No considerations of prudence or of gratitude could keep the nation faithful to any dynasty for a longer time than this. In breaking off from the divinely chosen house of David, and choosing to themselves a king, the Israelites had sown the seeds of instability in their state, and put themselves at the mercy of any ambitious pretender. Five dynasties had already borne rule in the two hundred years that the kingdom had lasted; four more were about to hold the throne in the remaining fifty years of its existence. "Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel," though said of Reuben only (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), fairly expressed the character of the entire kingdom, with which Reuben cast in its lot at the time of the separation.

Three verses suffice for the reign of Shallum, the son of Jabesh, who held the throne for only thirty days. Hearing of his conspiracy, Menahem, the son of Gadi - "the general," as Josephus calls him ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:11. &sect; 1) - marched from Tirzah to Samaria, got Shallum into his power, and put him to death (ver. 14). The writer concludes with the usual formula (ver. 15). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah King of Judah.</span> This date follows from that of ver. 8, and must stand or fall with it.

It was the royal city of the kingdom of the ten tribes from the later part of Jeroboam's reign to the building of Samaria by Omri (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-6.htm">1 Kings 16:6, 8, 15, 23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria</span> - Josephus says that there was a battle, in which Shallum was slain - <span class="cmt_word">and slew him, and reigned in his stead.</span>

It has been thought that Menahem could not have pushed his conquests so far, and a second Tiphsah has been invented in the Israelite highland, between Tirzah and Samaria, of which there is no other notice anywhere. But "Tiphsah," which means "passage" or "fordway," is an unsuitable name for a city in such a situation. The view of Keil is clearly tenable - that Zachariah had intended to carry on his father's warlike policy, and had collected an army for a great Eastern expedition, which had its head-quarters at the royal city of Tirzah, and was under the command of Menahem. As the expedition was about to start, the news came that Shallum had murdered Zachariah and usurped the throne. Menahem upon this proceeded from Tirzah to Samaria, crushed Shallum, and, returning to his army, carried out without further delay the expedition already resolved upon. The Assyrian records show that, at the probable date of the expedition, Assyria was exceptionally weak, and in no condition to resist an attack, though a little later, under Tiglath-pileser, she recovered herself<span class="cmt_word">. And all that were therein, and the coasts thereof, from Tirzah.</span> "From Tirzah" means "starting from Tir-zah," as in ver. 14. It is to be connected with "smote," not with "coasts." Because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it. Determined resistance on the part of a city summoned to surrender has always been regarded as justifying an extreme severity of treatment. It is not clear that Menahem transgressed the ordinary usages of war in what he did, however much he transgressed the laws of humanity. <span class="cmt_word">And all the women therein that were with child he ripped up</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, with the comment; and see also <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>).

But recently discovered Babylonian documents seem to prove that Pul (Pulu) was the Babylonian name for Tiglath-pileser, who reigned under that name in Babylon during his last two years, and appears in the Canon of Ptolemy as "Porus." Tiglath-pileser, the great founder of the later Assyrian empire, made himself king in  <span class="date">B.C. 745</span>, and proceeded to consolidate the Assyrian power on every side, after a period of great weakness and disorganization. He made several expeditions against Babylonia, and several into Syria and Palestine. The expedition in which he came into contact with Menahem is thought to have been that of his eighth year,  <span class="date">B.C. 738</span> (see G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 117-120; and, for the identity of Tiglath-pileser with Pul, see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1884, p. 198). <span class="cmt_word">And Menahem gave Pal a thousand talents of silver.</span> A vast sum certainly, equal to above a quarter of a million of our money, perhaps to some extent a punishment for the siege and sack of Tiphsah. But not a sum that it would have been impossible to pay.

The writer is again exceedingly brief. Pekah's reign was a remarkable one, and might have furnished much material to the historian. In conjunction with Rezin of Damascus, he made war upon Judaea, defeated Ahaz with great loss (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>), and laid siege to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>). Ahaz called in the aid or' Assyria, and Tiglath-pileser made two expeditions into Palestine - the one mentioned in ver. 29, and another some years afterwards. In the latter he seems to have had the assistance of Hoshea, who, with his sanction, slew Pekah, and became king. The scanty notices of our author must be supplemented from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-8</a>; and the Assyrian inscriptions. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah King of Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the thirty-ninth or thirty-eighth year</span> (see the comment on ver. 23).

Tiglath-pileser's entire reign lasted only eighteen years, yet it more than covered the entire reign of Pekah. When he first invaded the kingdom of Samaria, Menahem was upon the throne ('Eponym Canon,' p. 120, line 29); when he last attacked it, probably in  <span class="date">B.C. 730</span> - two years before his death in  <span class="date">B.C. 728</span> - he set up Hoshea, or, at any rate, sanctioned his usurpation (ibid., pp. 123, 124, lines 15-18).

He does not date events, like most Assyrian kings, by his regal years. His first expedition into Syria is thought, however, to have been in his third year,  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>, but there is no evidence that, on this occasion, he proceeded further south than Damascus, where he took tribute from Rezin. Some years after this -  <span class="date">B.C. 738</span>, according to Mr. G. Smith - he penetrated to Palestine, where his chief enemy was Azariah King of Judah, who had united under his sway most of the tribes as far as Hamath. After chastising Azariah, he extended his dominion over most of the neighboring states and kingdoms; and it was at this time that (as related in ver. 19) he took tribute from Menahem. Subsequently (about  <span class="date">B.C. 734</span>) he made an expedition for the purpose of conquest, which receives very scant notice, in one inscription only. This is probably the expedition of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">And took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah.</span> These were places in the extreme north of the Israelite territory, in the vicinity of the Lake Merem, such as would naturally be among the first to fall before an Assyrian invader (on their exact position, see the comment on 1 Kings 15:20). <span class="cmt_word">And Janoah.</span> Janoah is now generally regarded as identical with the modern <span class="accented">Hunin</span>, a village close by "an ancient fortress of great strength" (Robinson, 'Later Researches,' p. 371), in the hill country northwest of Merom.

Kedesh is beyond all doubt the "Kedes" or "Cades," of today - an important site in the same mountain district, rather more than six miles south of Hunin, and four from the "waters of Merom" (see Robinson, 'Later Researches,' pp. 366, 367). Hazer was in the near neighborhood of Kedesh, towards the south probably. The exact position is disputed. Robinson's arguments in favor of El-Khu reibch are weighty; but the engineers employed by the Palestine Exploration Fund regard Khurbat-Harrah, between Kedesh and the Lake Merom, as a still more probable situation. <span class="cmt_word">And Gilead.</span> "Gilead," in this connection, can scarcely be "the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan" (Keil, Bahr) - the territory of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, not of Naphtali. It is more likely to be a small district near Merom, perhaps the eastern coast of the lake (Gesenius), which was afterwards a part of Gaulouitis. The LXX., instead of <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3b4;</span>, have <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And Galilee</span>; Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 9:11, p. 190). The inscription of Tiglath-pileser, which appears to allude to this expedition, mentions "Galhi," and "Abel" (probably Abel-beth-maachah) as conquered at this time, and "added to Assyria." The places were, it says, on the border of the land of Beth-Omri (Samaria) (see the 'Eponym Canon,' p. 123, lines 6, 7). <span class="cmt_word">And carried them captive to Assyria.</span> Deportation of captives was largely practiced by Tiglath-pileser, as appears from the 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 118-120, and 122.

Azariah had paid great attention to the fortifying and arming of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9, 15</a>), and his son now followed in his footsteps. From <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a> we learn that he not only built the high gate of the temple, but also "on the wall of Ophel built much," Nor was he content with fortifying the capital.

At that time he pays to the Assyrians a heavy tribute, consisting of eighteen talents of gold, three hundred talents of silver, two hundred talents of copper, and twenty talents of spices. Subsequently, about the year  <span class="date">B.C. 734</span>, he is found in revolt. His alliance with Pekah, here implied, is directly stated by <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>. Begun in Jotham's reign, it continued, and came to a head, in the reign of Ahaz (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Pekah the son of Remaliah.</span> Pekah and Rezin intended to establish on the Jewish throne a certain Ben-Tabeal (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>), a creature of their own, with whose aid they thought to offer an effectual resistance to Assyria.

Ahaz, "possession," is a name never assigned to any other Israelite, and it is one not likely to have been given by a religious father like Jotham. In the Assyrian inscriptions the Jewish king contemporary with Rezin and Pekah is called "Yahu-khazi." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
