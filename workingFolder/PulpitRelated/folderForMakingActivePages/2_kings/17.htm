This has been supposed to mean "in the twentieth year from the accession of Jotham," or, in other words, in the fourth year of Ahaz, since Jotham reigned only sixteen years (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-33.htm">2 Kings 15:33</a>). But now the beginning of his reign is placed eight years later. An interregnum of this duration has been placed by some between Pekah and Doshea; but this is contradicted by <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, and also by an inscription of Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123,124, lines 17, 18). If Ahaz reigned sixteen years, the present statement would seem to be correct, and the former one wrong. Hoshea's accession may be confidently dated as in  <span class="date">B.C. 730</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Nine years</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-10.htm">2 Kings 18:10</a>). It is certain that Hoshea's reign came to an end in the first year of Sargon,  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, from which to  <span class="date">B.C. 730</span> would be eight complete, or nine incomplete, years. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-2.htm">2 Kings 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.</span> Hoshea's general attitude towards Jehovah was much the same as that of former kings of Israel. De maintained the calf-worship, leant upon "arms of flesh," and turned a deaf ear to the teaching of the prophets e.g, Hoshea and Micah, who addressed their warnings to him. But he was not guilty of any special wickedness - he set up no new idolatry; he seems to have allowed his subjects, if they pleased, to attend the festival worship at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11, 18</a>). The rabbis add that when the golden calf of Bethel had been carried off by the Assyrians in one of their incursions, he did not replace it ('Seder Olam,' <a href="../../par/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>.); but it is not at all clear that the image was carried away until Hoshea's reign was over (see Dr. Pusey's comment on Barnes' NotesHosea 10:6 in his ' Minor Prophets,' p. 64). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against him came up Shal-maneser King of Assyria.</span> Shalmaneser's succession to Tiglath-pileser on the throne of Assyria, once doubted, is now rendered certain by the Eponym Canon, which makes him ascend the throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, and cease to reign in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>. It is uncertain whether he was Tiglath-pileser's son or a usurper. The name, Shalmaneser (<span class="accented">Sali-manu-uzur</span>) was an old royal name in Assyria, and signified "Shalman protects" (compare the names Nabu-kudur-uzur, Nergal-asar-uzur, Nabu-pal-uzur, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And Hoshea became his servant.</span> Hoshea had been placed on the throne by Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123, 124, lines 17,18), and had paid him tribute (ibid., lines 18, 19). We must suppose that on Tiglath-pileser's death, in  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, he had revolted, and resumed his independence. Shalmaneser. having become king, probably came up against Hoshea in the same year, and forced him to resume his position of <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> tributary. This may have been the time when "<span class="accented">Shalman</span> spoiled Beth-Arbel in the day of battle" (Dos. 10:14), defeating Hoshea near that place (Arbela, now <span class="accented">Irbid</span>, in Galilee), and taking it. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him presents</span>; or, <span class="accented">rendered him tribute</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the margin of the Authorized Version. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as <i>he had done</i> year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So, King of Egypt.</span> We learn from the Prophet Hosea that the expediency of calling in Egypt as a counterpoise to Assyria had long been in the thoughts of those who directed the policy of the Israelite state (see <a href="../../par/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>, etc.). Now at last the plunge was taken. An Ethiopian dynasty of some strength and vigor had possession of Egypt, and held its court during some part of the year at Memphis (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>). The king who occupied the throne was called Shabak or Shebek - a name which the Greeks represented by Sabakos or Sevechus, and the Hebrews by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>. (The original vocalization of this word was probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Seveh</span>; but in later times this vocalization was lost, and the Masorites pointed the word as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Soh</span> or So). The Assyrians knew the king as Sibakhi, and contended with him under Sargon. Hoshea now sent an embassy to this monarch's court, requesting his alliance and his support against the great Asiatic power by which the existence of all the petty states of Western Asia was threatened. Shalmaneser was at the time endeavoring to capture Tyro, and Hoshea might reasonably fear that, when Tyre was taken, his own turn would come. It is not clear how Shabak received Hoshea's overtures; but we may, perhaps, assume that it was with favor, since otherwise Hoshea would scarcely have ventured to withhold his tribute, as he seems to have done. It must have been in reliance on "the strength of Egypt" that he ventured to brave the anger of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">And brought no present</span> - or, <span class="accented">sent no tribute - <span class="cmt_word"></span>to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the King of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span> The ultimate result is mentioned at once, before the steps by which it was accomplished are related. Shalmaneser did not "summon Hoshea before his presence to listen to his explanations," and then, "as soon as he came, take him prisoner, put him in chains, and imprison him" (as Ewald thinks), but simply declared war, invaded Hoshea's country, besieged him in his capital, and ultimately, when he surrendered, consigned him to a prison, as Nebuchadnezzar afterwards did Jehoiachin (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Otherwise Hoshea's reign would have come to an end in his sixth or seventh, and not in his ninth year. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the King of Assyria</span> - rather, <span class="accented">and the King of Assyria - <span class="cmt_word"></span>came up throughout all the land</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span>, with an army that spread itself at once over the whole land, that came to conquer, not merely to strike a blow, and obtain submission, as on the former occasion (see ver. 3, and the comment) - <span class="cmt_word">and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</span> From some time in Hoshea's seventh year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9</a>) to some time in his ninth (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-10.htm">2 Kings 18:10</a>). According to the Hebrew mode of reckoning, parts of years are counted as years; and thus the siege need not have lasted much over a year, though it may have been extended to nearly three years. In either case, there was ample time for Shabak to have brought up his forces, had he been so minded; and his failure to do so, or in any way to succor his ally, showed how little reliance was to be placed on Egyptian promises (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor <i>by</i> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the ninth year of Hoshea the wing of Assyria took Samaria.</span> In  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, the ninth year of Hoshea, there seems to have been a revolution at Nineveh. The reign of Shalmaneser came to an end, and Sargon seated himself upon the throne. There have been commentators on Kings (Keil, Bahr) who have supposed that Shalmaneser and Sargon were the same person, and have even claimed that the Assyrian inscriptions support their view. But the fact is otherwise. Nothing is more certain than that, according to them, Sargon succeeded Shalmaneser IV. in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> by a revolution, and was the head of a new dynasty. He claims in his annals, among his earliest acts, the siege and capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' p. 125). It is remarkable that Scripture, while in no way connecting him with the capture, never distinctly assigns it to Shalmaneser. Here we are only told that "the King of Assyria" took it. In <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9, 10</a>, where we are distinctly told that Shalmaneser "came up against Samaria, and besieged it," the capture is expressed by the phrase, "they took it," not "he took <span class="accented">it</span>." Perhaps neither king was present in person at the siege, or, at any rate, at its termination. The city may have been taken by an Assyrian general, while Shalmaneser and Sargon were contending for the crown. In that case, the capture might be assigned to either. Sargon certainly claims it; Shalmaneser's annals have been so mutilated by his successors that we cannot tell whether he claimed it or not. The city fell in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>; and the deportation of its inhabitants at once took place. <span class="cmt_word">And carried Israel away into Assyria.</span> The inscription of Sargon above referred to mentions only the deportation, from the city of Samaria itself, of 27,290 persons. No doubt a vast number of others were carried off from the smaller towns and from the country districts. Still, the country was not left uninhabited, and Sargon assessed its tribute at the old rate ('Eponym Canon,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.). Nor was the cry of Samaria destroyed, since we hear of it subsequently more than once in the Assyrian annals. <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in Halah.</span> "Halah" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) has been supposed by some to be the old Assyrian city (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) of Calah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>), which was, down to the' time of Tiglath-pileser, the main capital; but the difference of spelling is an objection, and the Assyrians do not seem to have ever transported subject-populations to their capitals. It is moreover reasonable to suppose that Halah, Habor, Gozan, and Hara (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>) were in the same neighborhood. This last consideration points to the "Chalcitis" of Ptolemy (5. 18) as the true "Halah," since it was in the immediate vicinity of the Khabour, of Gauzanitis, and of Haran. <span class="cmt_word">And in Habor by the river of Gozan.</span> This is a mistranslation. The Hebrew runs, "And on Habor (Khabor), the river of Gozan" (so also in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>). "Habor, the river of Gozan," is undoubtedly one of the Khabours. Those who find Halah in Calah, or in Calacine (Calachene), generally prefer the eastern river which runs into the Tigris from Kurdistan a little below Jezireh. But there is no evidence that rids river bore the name in antiquity. The Western Khabour, on the other hand, was well known to the Assyrians under that appellation, and is the Aborrhas of Strabo and Procopius, the Chaboras of Pliny and Ptolemy, the Aburas of Isadore of Charax, and the Abora of Zosimus. It adjoins a district called  Chalcitis, and it drains the country of  Gauzanitis or Mygdonia. The Western Khabour is a river of Upper Mesopotamia, and runs into the Euphrates from the northeast near the site of the ancient Circesion. The tract which it drains is called Mygdonia by Strabo, Gauzanitis by Ptolemy. <span class="cmt_word">And in the cities of the Medes.</span> Media had been repeatedly invaded and ravaged by the Assyrians from the time of Vulnirari IV. (about  <span class="date">B.C. 810</span>); but the first king to conquer any portion of it, and people its cities with settlers from other parts of his dominions, was Sargon (Oppert, ' Inscriptions des Sargonides,' pp. 25, 37). We learn from the present passage that a certain number of these settlers were Israelites (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a> and Tobit 1:14).

A certain number, however, came in from a different source, being imposed upon the people by their kings. To this class belong the desertion of the temple-worship, enforced by Jeroboam (vex. 21), the setting up of the calves at Dan and Bethel (ver. 16) by the same, and the Baal and <span class="accented">Astarte</span> worship (ver. 16), introduced by Ahab.

The writer, before dismissing the subject of the Israelite kingdom, proceeds to inform us of certain results of the conquest. Having removed the bulk of the native inhabitants, the Assyrians did not allow the country to lie waste, but proceeded to replace the population which they had carried off by settlers from other localities (ver. 24). These settlers were, after a short time, incommoded by lions, which increased upon them, and diminished their numbers (ver. 25). The idea arose that the visitation was supernatural, and might be traced to the fact that the newcomers, not knowing "the manner of the God of the land," displeased him by the neglect of his rites or by the introduction of alien worship (ver. 26). A remedy for this was sought in the sending to them from Assyria one of the priests who had been carried off, from whom it was thought they might learn how "the God of the land" was to be propitiated. This was the orion of the "mixed religion" which grew up in the country. While the nations who had replaced the Israelites brought in their own superstitions, and severally worshipped their own gods (vers. 30, 31), there was a general acknowledgment of Jehovah by all of them, and a continuance of Jehovistic worship in the various high places. The nations both "feared the Lord, and served their graven images," down to the time when the writer of Kings composed his work (vers. 33-41). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria brought men from Babylon.</span> It has been supposed, in connection with <a href="../../par/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, that no colonists were introduced into the country till the time of Esarhaddon, who began to reign in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. But this, which would be intrinsically most improbable (for when did a king forego his tribute from a fertile country for forty-one years?), is contradicted by a statement of Sargon, that he placed colonists there in  <span class="date">B.C. 715</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 415). These were not necessarily the first; and, on the whole, it is probable that the re-peopling of the country begun earlier. Hamath was reduced by Sargon in  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, and punished severely. Its inhabitants were carried off, and replaced by Assyrians ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Probably some of them were at once settled in Samaria. The conquest of Babylon by Sargon was not till later. It occurred in  <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>, and was probably followed by the immediate deportation of some of its inhabitants to the same quarter. <span class="cmt_word">And from Cuthah.</span> "Cuthah," or "Cutha," was an important Babylonian city, often mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 74, 75; vol. 3. p. 35; vol. 5. pp. 93, 94, 102). Its ruins exist at the site now called Ibrahim, about fifteen miles northeast of Babylon. Sargon must have become master of it when he put down Merodach-Baladan and assumed the sovereignty of Babylonia, in  <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>. Why the later Jews called the Samaritans "Cuthaeans," rather than Sepharvites, or Avites, or Hamathites, it is impossible to determine. Possibly the Cuthaean settlers preponderated in numbers ever the others. <span class="cmt_word">And from Ava.</span> "Ava" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) is probably the same as the Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>) of <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a> and 2 Kings 19:13, and perhaps identical with the Ahava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) of Ezra (Ezra 8:15, 21). The city intended is thought to be the "Is" of Herodotus (1. 179), and the modern Hit. Hit lies upon the Euphrates, about a hundred and thirty miles above Babylon, in lat. 33&deg; 45' nearly. It is famous for its bitumen springs. <span class="cmt_word">And from Hamath</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 14:25). Hamath on the Orontes was conquered by Sargon in  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, two years after his capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Its rude inhabitants were carried off, and Assyrians were placed there. <span class="cmt_word">And from Sepharvaim.</span> It is generally allowed that "Sepharvaim" is "Sippara," the dual form being accounted for by the fact that Sippara was a double town, partly on the right and partly on the left bank of a stream derived from the Euphrates. Hence Pliny speaks of it as "oppida Hipparenorum" ('Hist. Nat.,' 6:30). The exact site, at Abu-Habba, sixteen miles southwest of Baghdad, has only recently been discovered (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1885, vol. 8. pp. 172-176). <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</span> Transplantation of nations, commenced by Tiglath-pileser, was practiced on a still larger scale by Sargon. The following summary will illustrate this point: "In all his wars Sargon largely employed the system of wholesale deportation. The Israelites were removed from Samaria, and planted partly in Gozan or Mygdonia, and partly in the cities recently taken from the Medes. Hamath and Damascus were peopled with captives from Armenia and other regions of the north. A portion of the Tibareni were carried captive to Assyria, and Assyrians were established in the Tibarenian country. Vast numbers of the inhabitants of the Zagros range were also transported to Assyria; Babylonians, Cuthaeans, Sapharrites, Arabians, and others were placed in Samaria; men from the extreme east (perhaps Media) in Ashdod. The Comukha were removed from the extreme north to Susiana, and Chaldaeans were brought from the extreme south to supply their places. Everywhere Sargon 'changed the abodes' of his subjects, his aim being, as it would seem, to weaken the stronger races by dispersion, and to destroy the spirit of the weaker ones by severing at a blow all the links which unite a patriotic people to the country it has long inhabited. The practice had not been unknown to previous monarchs; but it had never been employed by any of them so generally or on so grand a scale as it was by this king" (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 423).

We may gather from what is said here that, though new settlers had been brought into the country by the Assyrians, yet still there had been a considerable decrease in the population, which had been favorable to the lions multiplying. The new settlers, it is to be noted, were placed in the towns (ver. 24); and it is probable that many of the country districts lay waste and desolate.

The explanation of the word as "tents" or "huts of daughters," which Satisfied Selden, Calmer, Gesenius, Winer, Keil, and others, is rendered absolutely impossible by the context, which requires that the word, whatever its meaning, should be the name of a deity.

The Babylonian goddess who corresponds most nearly to the word, and is most likely to be intended, would seem to be Zirat-banit, the wife of Merodach ('Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' vol. 4. pp. 136-147). <span class="accented">Zirat-banit</span> means "the creating lady;" but the Hebrew interpreter seems to have mistaken the first element, which he confounded with <span class="accented">Zarat</span>, the Baby-Ionian for "tents," and so translated by "Succoth." The goddess Zirat-banit was certainly one of the principal deities of Babylon, and would be more likely to be selected than any ether goddess.

But the etymological resemblance of the two words is not close, and it is not at all certain that the Hamathites at any time acknowledged the Phoenician deities. The Hamathite inscriptions are in the character now known as "Hittite;" and there is reason to believe that the people were non-Semitic. This identification, therefore, must be regarded as very doubtful. Perhaps "Ashima" represents Simi, the daughter of Hadad (see Melito, 'Apologia').

We do not know what the religion of the Avites was, and need not be surprised that the names of their gods are new to us.

He expects his words to reach the ears of the mixed race inhabiting Samaria in his day, and would fain warn them against their idolatrous practices, and point them to the pure worship of Jehovah. It is pleasing to remember that ultimately the mixed race was won to the true faith, and that the Samaritans of our Lord's time were as true worshippers of Jehovah, and as zealous followers of the Law, as the Jews themselves. The interesting community at Nablous still maintains Samaritan forms, and reads the Samaritan Pentateuch.

Not much confidence can be placed in these representations. The Babylonian gods were ordinarily figured in human forms. Animal ones - as those of the bull and the lion, generally winged and human-headed, were in a few cases, but only in a few, used to represent the gods symbolically. Other emblems employed were the winged circle for Asshur; the disc plain or four-rayed for the male sun, six or eight-rayed for the female sun; the crescent for the moon-god Sin; the thunderbolt for the god of the atmosphere, Vul or Rimmon; the wedge or arrow-head, the fundamental element of writing, for Nebo.
