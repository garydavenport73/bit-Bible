Elisha, on its approach, recommended the Shunammite, though she was a woman of substance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>), to quit her home and remove to some other residence, where she mighty, escape the pressure of the calamity He left it to her to choose the place of her temporary abode. The phrase, "God hath <span class="accented">called for</span> a famine," means no more and no less than "God has determined that there shall be a famine." With God to speak the word is to bring about the event. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall also come upon the land seven years.</span> Seven years was the actual duration of the great famine, which Joseph foretold in Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>), and was the ideally perfect period for a severe famine (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>). Many of the best meteorologists are inclined to regard the term of "seven years" as a cyclic period in connection with weather changes.

There were still those to whom the prophet was the mouthpiece of God, who waited on his words, and accepted them as Divine commands whereto they were ready to render immediate and entire obedience. It is conjectured by some that the woman had become a widow, and fallen into comparative poverty; but the narrative gives no indication of this. Even opulent persons have to migrate in times of severe dearth. <span class="cmt_word">And she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the philistines.</span> Philistia was a great grain country (<a href="../../par/judges/15-5.htm">Judges 15:5</a>), and, though not altogether exempt from famine, was less exposed to it than either Judaea or Samaria. The soil was exceedingly fertile, and the vapors from the Mediterranean descended upon it in clews and showers, when their beneficial influence was not felt further inland. The Shunammite may have had other reasons for fixing her residence in the Philistine country; but probably she was chiefly determined in her choice by its proximity and its productiveness. Seven years. As long, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as the famine lasted (see the last clause of ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-3.htm">2 Kings 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it earns to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines.</span> She stayed no longer than she could help. Her own land, where she could have the ministrations of a "man of God" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), was dear to her; and no sooner had the famine abated than she returned to it. <span class="cmt_word">And she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</span> During her prolonged absence, some grasping neighbor had seized on the unoccupied house and the uncultivated estate adjoining it, and now refused to restore them to the rightful owner. Widows were especially liable to such treatment on the part of greedy oppressors, since they were, comparatively speaking, weak and defenseless (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>). Under such circumstances the injured party would naturally, in an Oriental country, make appeal to the king (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-4.htm">2 Samuel 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-26.htm">2 Kings 6:26</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king talked with Gehazi</span>; rather, <span class="accented">now the king was talking with Gehazi</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the Revised Version. The king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, happened to be talking with Gehazi at the moment when the woman came into his presence and "cried" to him. It has been reasonably concluded from this, that chronological order is not observed in the portion of the narrative which treats of Elisha and his doings, since a king of Israel would scarcely be in familiar conversation with a leper (Keil). It may be added that Gehazi can scarcely have continued to be the servant of Elisha, as he evidently now was, after his leprosy. He must have dwelt "without the gate." <span class="cmt_word">The servant of the man of God.</span> That a king should converse with a servant is, no doubt, somewhat unusual; but, as Bahr notes, there is nothing in the circumstance that need astonish us. It is natural enough that, having been himself a witness of so many of the prophet's marvelous acts done in public, Jehoram should become curious concerning those other marvelous acts which he had performed in private, among his personal friends and associates, with respect to which many turnouts must have got abroad; and should wish to obtain an account of them from a source on which he could rely. If he had this desire, he could scarcely apply to the prophet himself, with whom he was at no time on familiar terms, and who would shrink from enlarging on his own miraculous powers. "To whom, then, could he apply with more propriety for this information than to the prophet's familiar servant" - an eye-witness of most of them, and one who would have no reason for reticence? Oriental ideas would not be shocked by the king's sending for any subject from whom he desired information, and questioning him. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</span> Miracles are often called "great things" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) in the Old Testament, but generally in connection with God as the doer of them (see <a href="../../par/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-10.htm">Job 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-5.htm">Job 37:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/71-19.htm">Psalm 71:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-21.htm">Psalm 106:21</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-5.htm">2 Kings 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this <i>is</i> the woman, and this <i>is</i> her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Elisha - <span class="cmt_word">had restored a dead Body to life.</span> This was undoubtedly the greatest of all Elisha's miracles, and Gehazi naturally enlarged upon it. As an eye-witness (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29-36</a>), he could give all the details. <span class="cmt_word">That, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.</span> The coincidence can scarcely have been accidental. Divine providence so ordered matters that, just when the king's interest in the woman was most warm, she should appear before him to urge her claim. At another time, Jehoram would, it is probable, have been but slightly moved by her complaint. Under the peculiar circumstances, he was deeply moved, and at once granted the woman the redress for which she asked. <span class="cmt_word">And Gehazi said, Wry lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> The Shunammite was accompanied by her son, now a boy of at least tea or eleven years old - the actual object of Elisha's miracle. The king's interest in the woman would be still more roused by this circumstance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-6.htm">2 Kings 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that <i>was</i> hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the king asked the woman, she told him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the king made inquiry of the woman</span>, <span class="accented">and she answered him</span>. The extent of the inquiries is not indicated. They may have included questions concerning the miracle, as well as questions concerning the woman's claim to the land and house, and the evidence which she could produce of proprietorship. <span class="cmt_word">So the king appointed unto her a certain officer</span> - literally, <span class="accented">a certain eunuch</span>, or <span class="accented">chamberlain - <span class="cmt_word"></span>an officer of the court, who was in his confidence, and would give effect to his directions saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</span> The order was, that not only was the Shunammite to receive back her house and estate, but that she was also to have "the mesne profits" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the full value of all that the land had produced beyond the expense of cultivation during the seven yearn of her absence. English law lays down the same rule in cases of unlawful possession for which there is no valid excuse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-7.htm">2 Kings 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-15.</span> <span class="accented">- Elisha's visit to Damascus</span>, <span class="accented">and its consequences</span>. It has been usual to connect this visit of Elisha's to Damascus with the commission given to Elijah many years previously, to anoint Hazael to be king over Syria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). But it is certainly worthy of remark that neither is Elijah authorized to devolve his corn-mission on another, nor is he said to have done so, nor is there any statement in the present narrative or elsewhere that Elisha anointed Hazael. It is therefore quite possible that Elisha's journey was wholly unconnected with the command given to Elijah. It may, as Ewald imagines, have been the consequence of disorders and dangers in Samaria, growing out of the divergence of views between Jehoram and the queen-mother Jezebel, who still retained considerable influence over the government; and Elisha may have taken his journey, not so much for the sake of a visit, as of a prolonged sojourn. That he attracted the attention both of Benhadad and of his successor Hazael is not surprising. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha came to Damascus.</span> It was a bold step, whatever the circumstances that led to it. Not very long previously the Syrian king had made extraordinary efforts to capture Elisha, intending either to kin him or to keep him confined as a prisoner (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18-19</a>). Elisha had subsequently helped to baffle his plans of conquest, and might be thought to have caused the disgraceful retreat of the Syrian army from the walls of Samaria, which he had certainly prophesied (<a href="../../par/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>). But Elisha was not afraid. He was probably <span class="accented">commissioned</span> to take his journey, whether its purpose was the anointing of Hazael or no. <span class="cmt_word">And Benhadad the King of Syria was sick.</span> Ewald supposes that this "sickness" was the result of the disgrace and discredit into which he had fallen since his ignominious retreat, without assignable reason, from before the walls of Samaria; but Ben-hadad must have been of an age When the infirmities of nature press in upon a man, and when illness has to be expected. He was a contemporary of Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), who had now been dead ten or twelve years. <span class="cmt_word">And it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</span> Elisha seems to have attempted no concealment of his presence. No sooner was he arrived than his coming was reported to Benhadad. The Syrians had by this time learnt to give him the name by which he was commonly known (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 21, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2, 18</a>) in Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-8.htm">2 Kings 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto Hazael.</span> It is implied that Hazael was in attendance on Benhadad in his sick-room, either permanently as a chamberlain, or occasionally as a minister. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:4. &sect; 6), he was "the most faithful of the king's domestics" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). We cannot presume from ver. 12 that he had as yet distinguished himself as a warrior. <span class="cmt_word">Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God.</span> It was usual, both among the heathen and among the Israelites, for those who consulted a prophet to bring him a present (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>). Hence, mainly, the great wealth of the Delphic and other oracles. Naaman (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>) had brought with him a rich present when he went to consult Elisha in Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And inquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease!</span> The miracles of Elisha had had at any rate this effect - they had convinced the Syrians that Jehovah was a great and powerful God, and made them regard Elisha himself as a true prophet. Their faith in their own superstitions must have been at least partially shaken by these convictions. It was by these and similar weakenings of established errors that the world was gradually educated, and the way prepared for the introduction of Christianity. There was very early among the Syrians a flourishing Christian Church.

Orientals are guilty of extreme ostentation with respect to the presents that they make. As Chardin says, "Fifty persons often carry what a single one could have very well borne" ('Voyage en Perse,' vol. 3. p. 217). The practice is illustrated by the bas-reliefs of Nineveh and Persepolis, which furnish proofs of its antiquity. One present-bearer carries a few pomegranates; another, a bunch of grapes; a third, a string of locusts; a fourth, two small ointment-pots; a fifth, a branch of an olive tree, and the like (Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pls. 8, 9, etc.). It is not unlikely that a single camel could have carried the whole. <span class="cmt_word">And earns and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad King of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying</span> - Benhadad seeks to propitiate Elisha by calling himself his son, thus indicating the respect he feels for him (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I recover of this disease?</span> Nothing was more common in the ancient world than the consultation of an oracle or a prophet in cases of disease or other bodily affliction. Two questions were commonly asked, "Shall I recover?" and "How may I recover?" So Pheron of Egypt is said to have consulted an oracle with respect to his blindness (Herod., 2:111), and Battus of Cyrene to have done the same with respect to his stammering (ibid., 4:155). It was seldom that a clear and direct answer was given.

Hazael does not accuse Elisha of making him out a dog in the future, but calls himself a dog in the present. "Dog" is a word of extreme contempt - "the most contemptuous epithet of abuse" (Winer), as appears, among other places, from <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a>.

A death of the same kind is recorded in the Persian history entitled 'Kholasat el Akhbar,' which contains (p. 162) the following passage: "The malik ordered that they should place a carpet on Abdallah's mouth, so that his life was cut off." <span class="cmt_word">And spread it on his face, so that he died.</span> It has been supposed by some commentators, as Luther, Schultz, Geddes, Boothroyd, that Benhadad put the wet <span class="accented">macber</span> on his own face for refreshment, and accidentally suffocated himself; but this is very unlikely, and it is certainly not the natural sense of the words. As "Hazael" is the subject of "departed" and "came" and "answered" in ver. 14, so it is the natural subject of "took" and "dipped" and "spread" in ver. 15. Ver. 11 also would be unintelligible if Hazael entertained no murderous intentions. Why Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 93, Eng. trans.) introduces a "bath-servant," unmentioned in the text, to murder Benhadad for no assignable reason, it is difficult to conjecture. <span class="cmt_word">And Hazael reigned in his stead.</span> The direct succession of Hazael to Benhadad is confirmed by the inscription on the Black Obelisk, where he appears as King of Damascus (line 97) a few years only after Benhadad (<span class="accented">Bin-idri</span>) had been mentioned as king.

They cannot possibly have the sense assigned to them in our version, and are most probably a gloss which has crept into the text from the margin. <span class="cmt_word">Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat King of Judah began to reign.</span> Jehoram's reign was sometimes counted from the seventeenth year of his father, when he was given the royal title, sometimes from his father's twenty-third year, when he was associated, and sometimes from his father's death in his twenty-fifth year, when he became sole king (see the comment on 2 Kings 1:17 and <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>).

(On the nature of this worship, see the ' Commentary on the First Book of Kings,' p. 374.) The "house of Ahab" maintained and spread the Baal-worship, wherever it had influence. Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, championed it in Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-53.htm">1 Kings 22:53</a>); Jehoram, his brother, allowed its continuance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>); Jehoram of Judah was induced by his wife, Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, to countenance it in Judaea; Athaliah, when she usurped the throne upon the death of her son Ahaziah, made it the state religion in that country. "Evil communications corrupt good manners." The alliance of the two separated kingdoms, concluded between Jehoshaphat and Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>), had no tangible result beyond the introduction into Judah of the licentious and debasing superstition which had previously overspread the sister country. <span class="cmt_word">For the daughter of Ahab was his wife.</span> In ver. 26 Athaliah, the wife of Jehoram, is called "the daughter of Omri;" but by "daughter" in that place must be meant "descendant" or "granddaughter." Athaliah has been well called "a second Jezebel." <span class="cmt_word">And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> The wicked actions of Jehoram are recorded at some length in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2-4, 11-13</a>). Shortly after his accession he put to death his six brothers - Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Ahaziah (?), Michael, and Shephatiah - in order to "strengthen himself." At the same time, he caused many of the "princes of Israel" to be executed. Soon afterwards he "made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to become idolaters), "and compelled Judah thereto." That the idolatry, which he introduced, was the Baal-worship is clear, both from the present passage and from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-13.htm">2 Chronicles 21:13</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a></div><div class="verse">Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, <i>and</i> to his children.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake.</span> The natural punishment of apostasy was rejection by God, and on rejection would, as a matter of course, follow destruction and ruin. God had declared by Moses, "If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of  the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his  commandments and statutes, which I command thee this day; all these curses shall come upon thee  The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in  all that thou settest thine hand unto for to  do, <span class="accented">until thou be destroyed</span>, and until thou  perish quickly; because of the wickedness  of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken  me.

The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall  pursue thee <span class="accented">till thou perish</span>. And thy heaven which is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is underneath thee shall be iron....

Thou shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-37</a>). The apostasy of Jeheram, and of the nation under him, was calculated to bring about the immediate fulfillment of all these threats, and would have done so but for a restraining cause. God had made promises to David, and to his seed after him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29-37</a>, etc.), which would be unfulfilled if Judah's candlestick were at once removed. He had declared, "If thy children forsake my Law, and walk not in my statutes... I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges. Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take away, nor suffer my truth to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips; I have sworn once by my holiness that I will not fail David." If he had now swept away the Jewish kingdom, he would have dealt more hardly with these who clave to David than with those that broke off from him. He would not have shown the "faithfulness" or the "mercy" which he had promised, he would have forgotten "the loving-kindnesses which he aware unto David in his truth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-49.htm">Psalm 89:49</a>). Therefore he would not - he <span class="accented">could</span> not  - as yet "destroy Judah," with which, in point of fact, he bore for above three centuries longer, until at last the cup of their iniquities was full, and "there was no remedy." <span class="cmt_word">As he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.</span> There is no "and" in the original.

On the death of David, Edom seems to have revolted under a prince named Hadad, and to have re-established its independence. It had been again sub-jeered by the time of Jehoshaphat, who appointed a governor over it (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and treated it as a portion of his own territories (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>). Now the yoke was finally thrown off, as had been prophesied (<a href="../../par/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>). Edom became once more a separate kingdom, and was especially hostile to Judah. In the reign of Ahaz the Edomites "smote Judah" and carried away many captives (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). When the Chaldaeans attacked and besieged Jerusalem, they cried, "Down with it, down with it, even to the ground!" (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). They looked on with joy at the capture of the holy city (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>), and "stood in the crossway, to cut off such as escaped" (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>). After the return from the Captivity, they were still Judah's enemies, and am especially denounced as such by the Prophet Malachi (<a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3-5</a>). In the Maccabee wars, we find them always on the Syrian side (1 Mac. 4:29, 61 1 Mac. 5:3 1 Mac. 6:31; 2 Macc. 10:15, etc.), doing their best to rivet the hateful yoke of the heathen on their suffering brethren.

He describes the wickedness of Ahaziah, for the most part, in general terms, attributes it to his connection with the "house of <span class="accented">Ahab</span>," and notes his alliance with Joram of Israel against the Syrians, and his visit to his brother monarch at Samaria, which led on to his death. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab King of Israel.</span> In <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-29.htm">2 Kings 9:29</a> the year of Ahaziah's accession is said to have been Joram's <span class="accented">eleventh</span> year. It is conjectured that he began to reign as viceroy to his father during his severe illness in Joram's eleventh year, and became sole king at his father's death in the year following. Did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram King of Judah begin to reign; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> begin to be full king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a></div><div class="verse">Two and twenty years old <i>was</i> Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <i>was</i> Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign. The writer of Chronicles says, "two and forty" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>), which is absolutely impossible, since his father was but forty when he died (see ver. 17, and setup. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5, 20</a>). Even "two and twenty" is a more advanced age than we should have expected, since Ahaziah was the youngest of Jehoram's sons (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>); he must therefore have been born in his father's nineteenth year. Yet he had several elder brothers (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>)! To explain this, we have to remember <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the early age at which marriage is contracted in the East (twelve years); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fact that each prince had, besides his wife, several concubines. That Joram had several appears from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's Ares was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri King of Israel</span>. There is something very remarkable in the dignity and precedence attached to Omri. He was, no doubt, regarded of a sort of second founder of the kingdom of Israel, having been the first monarch to establish anything like a stable dynasty. His "statutes" were looked upon as the fundamental laws of the kingdom, and were "kept" down to the time of its destruction (<a href="../../par/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>). Foreigners knew Samaria as <span class="accented">Beth</span>. <span class="accented">Khumri</span>, or "the house of Omri." He is the only Israelite king mentioned by name on the Moabite Stone (line 5), and the earliest mentioned in the inscriptions of Assyria. Even Jehu, who put an end to his dynasty, was regarded by the Assyrians as his descendant, and known under the designation of" Yahua, the son of Khnmri" (Black Obelisk, epig. 2.). Athallah, the daughter of Ahab, is called "the daughter of Omri," not only in the present passage, but also in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>.

What is specially intended is that Ahaziah kept up the Baal-worship introduced by his father into Judah. <span class="cmt_word">And did evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab</span>; literally, for he was related <span class="accented">by marriage to the house of</span> <span class="accented">Ahab</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> is any relation by marriage, not "son-in-law" <span class="accented">in</span> particular (see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>, and the comment on the place).

It is best, therefore, to follow our translators, who are in accord both with the Septuagint and with the Vulgate. Ahaziah followed the example of his grandfather Jehoshaphat, who had accompanied Ahab to Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29</a>), to fight against the Syrians in the time of Benhadad. That the city was still disputed shows the importance which it possessed in the eyes of both parties. <span class="cmt_word">And the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> It appears that Hazael, soon after his accession, with the ardor of a young prince anxious to distinguish himself, made an expedition against Ramoth-Gilead, which had been recovered by the Israelites between the death of Ahab and the time of which the historian is now treating. Joram went to the relief of the town with a large force, and, being received within the walls, maintained a gallant defense (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>), in the course of which he was wounded severely, though not fatally. Thereupon he and his brother king quitted the town and returned to their respective capitals, leaving a strong garrison in Ramoth-Gilead under Jehu and some other captains. Joram needed rest and careful nursing on account of his wounds, and Ahaziah would naturally withdraw with him; since he could not serve under a mere general.
