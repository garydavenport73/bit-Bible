Compare the similar practice (ibid., p. 101) of the Assyrian monarchs. <span class="cmt_word">Was a great man with his master, and honorable</span> - rather, honor<span class="accented">ed</span>, or <span class="accented">held in esteem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2c;</span> LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">because by him the Lord had given deliverance</span> - literally, <span class="accented">salvation</span>, or <span class="accented">safety</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">unto Syria.</span> Probably he had commanded the Syrian army in some of its encounters with the Assyrians, who at this time, under Shalmaneser II., were threatening the independence of Syria, but did not succeed in subjecting it. <span class="cmt_word">He was also a mighty man in valor</span> <span class="accented">- gibbor hail</span>, commonly translated in our version by "mighty man of valor," does not mean much more than "a good soldier" - but he was <span class="cmt_word">a leper.</span> Leprosy had many degrees. Some of the lighter kinds did not incapacitate a man for military service, or unfit him for the discharge of court duties (ver. 18). But there was always a danger that the lighter forms might develop into the severer ones.

She has, in her servile condition, contracted an affection both for her master and her mistress, and her sympathies are strongly with them. Perhaps she had no serious purpose in speaking as she did. The words burst from her as a mere expression of goodwill. She did not contemplate any action resulting from them. "Oh that things could be otherwise than as they are! Had I my dear master in my own country, it would be easy to accomplish his cure. The prophet is so powerful and so kind. He both could and would recover <span class="accented">him</span>." Any notion of her vague wish being carried out, being made the ground of a serious embassy, was probably far from the girl's thought. But the "bread cast upon the waters returns after many days." There is no kind wish or kind utterance that may not have a result far beyond anything that the wisher or utterer contemplated. Good wishes are seeds that ofttimes take root, and grow, and blossom, and bear fruit beyond the uttermost conception of those who sow them.

"We see," Bahr says, "from the king's readiness, how anxious he was for the restoration of Naaman." <span class="cmt_word">And I will send a letter unto the King of Israel.</span> Letters had been interchanged between Solomon and Hiram, King of Tyro (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3-11</a>), a century earlier; and the communications of king with king in the East, though sometimes carried on orally by ambassadors, probably took place to a large extent by means of letters from a very early date. Written communications seem to have led to the outbreak of the war by which the foreign dynasty of the Hyksos was driven out of Egypt, and the native supremacy reestablished ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 199, 200). Written engagements were certainly entered into between the Egyptian kings and the Hittites at a date earlier than the Exodus (ibid., pp. 291, 310). Benhadad evidently regards the sending of a letter to a neighboring monarch as a natural and ordinary occurrence. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Naaman - <span class="cmt_word">departed, and took with him ten talents of silver</span> - reckoned by Keil as equal to 25,000 thalers, or &pound;3750; by Thenius as equal to 20,000 thalers, or &pound;3000 - <span class="cmt_word">and six thousand pieces of gold.</span> "Pieces of gold" did not yet exist, since coin had not been invented. Six thousand shekels' weight of gold is probably intended. This would equal, according to Keil, 50,000 thalers (&pound;7500); according to Thenius, 60,000 thalers (&pound;9000). Such sums are quite within the probable means of a rich Syrian nobleman of the time, a favorite at court, and the generalissimo of the Syrian army. Naaman evidently supposed that he would have, directly or indirectly, to purchase his cure. And ten changes of raiment (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; Hom., 'Od.,' 13:67; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:2. &sect; 8; ' Anab.,' 1:2. &sect; 29; etc.). The practice of giving dresses of honor as presents continues in the East to this day.

The historian omits these, and hastens to, communicate to us the main point of the epistle, or rather, perhaps, its main drift, which he states somewhat baldly and bluntly. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I have</span> therewith <span class="cmt_word">sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him</span> - literally, and thou <span class="accented">shalt recover him</span> - <span class="cmt_word">of his leprosy.</span> The letter made no mention of Elisha. Ben-hadad assumed that, if the King of Israel had in his dominions a person able to cure leprosy, he would be fully cognizant of the fact, and would at once send for him, and call upon him for an exertion of his gift or art. He is not likely to have comprehended the relations in which Kings of Israel stood towards the Jehovistic prophets, but may probably have thought of Elisha "as a sort of chief magus, or as the Israelitish high priest" (Menken), whom the king would have at his beck and call, and whose services would be completely at his disposal.

Elisha's early miracles were mostly wrought with a certain amount of secrecy. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</span> The king misjudged Benhadad, but not without some grounds of reason, if he was ignorant of Elisha's miraculous gifts.

Thus the rumor went through the town, and reached the ears of the prophet, who therefore sent a message to the king.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-9.htm">2 Kings 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot.</span> The Syrians had had chariots, and used horses to draw them, from a remote date. The Hyksos, who introduced horses and chariots into Egypt, though not exactly a Syrian people, entered Egypt from Syria; and in all the Syrian wars of the Egyptians, which began about  <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span>, we find their adversaries employing a chariot force. In one representation of a fight between the Egyptians and a people invading Egypt from' Syria, the war-chariots of the latter are drawn by four oxen; but generally the horse was used on both sides. Syria imported her horses and chariots from Egypt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>), and, as appears from this passage, employed them for peaceful as well as for warlike purposes. There was a similar employment of them from a very early time in Egypt (see <a href="../../par/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And stood at the door of the house of Elisha</span>. Elisha was at this time residing in Samaria, whether in his own house or not we cannot say. His abode was probably a humble one; and when the great general, accompanied by his cavalcade of followers, drew up before it, he had, we may be sure, no intention of dismounting and entering. What he expected he tells us himself in ver. 11. The prophet regarded his pride and self-conceit as deserving of a rebuke. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha sent a messenger unto him.</span> Elisha asserted the dignity of his office. Naaman was "a great man" (ver. 1), with a high sense of his own importance, and regarded the prophet as very much inferior to himself. He expected to be waited on, courted, to receive every possible attention. Elisha no doubt intended very pointedly to rebuke him by remaining in his house, and communicating with the great man by a messenger. But there is no ground for taxing him with "priestly pride," or even with "impoliteness" on this account. He had to impress upon the Syrian noble the nothingness of wealth and earthly grandeur, and the dignity of the prophetic office. He did not do more than was requisite for these purposes. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times.</span>  Elisha speaks no doubt, "by the word of the Lord."  He is directed to require of Naaman a compliance with a somewhat burdensome order. The nearest point on the course of Jordan was above twenty miles distant from Samaria. Naaman is to go thither, to strip himself, and to plunge into the stream seven times. The directions seem given to test his faith. They may be compared with that of our Lord to the blind man, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam," and, in another point of view, with that given to Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3-5</a>), and that of Elijah to his servant (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-43.htm">1 Kings 18:43</a>). To repeat a formal act six times with- out perceiving any result, and yet to persevere and repeat it a seventh time, requires a degree of faith and trust that men do not often possess. <span class="cmt_word">And thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</span> The scaly leprous scurf shall fall off and reveal clean flesh underneath. Thy body shall be manifestly freed from all defilement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-11.htm">2 Kings 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Naaman was wroth... and said.</span> Not unnaturally. As a "great man," the lord on whose arm the king leant, and the captain of the host of Syria, Naaman was accustomed to extreme deference, and all the outward tokens of respect and reverence. He had, moreover, come with a goodly train, carrying gold and silver and rich stuffs, manifestly prepared to pay largely for whatever benefit he might receive. To be curtly told, "Go, wash in Jordan," by the prophet's servant, without the prophet himself condescending to make himself visible, would have been trying to any Oriental's temper, and to one of Naaman's rank and position might well seem an insult. The Syrian general had pictured to himself a very different scene. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the Name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper</span>; rather, take away <span class="accented">the leprosy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). Naaman had imagined a striking scene, whereof he was to be the central figure, the prophet descending, with perhaps a wand of office, the attendants drawn up on either side, the passers-by standing to gaze  - a solemn invocation of the Deity, a waving to and fro of the wand in the prophet's hand, and a sudden manifest cure, wrought in the open street of the city, before the eyes of men, and at once noised abroad through the capital, so as to make him "the observed of all observers, the cynosure of all neighboring eyes." Instead of this, he is bidden to go as he came, to ride twenty miles to the stream of the Jordan, generally muddy, or at least discolored, and there to wash himself, with none to look on but his own attendants, with no <span class="accented">eclat</span>, no pomp or circumstance, no glory of surroundings. It is not surprising that he was disappointed and vexed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-12.htm">2 Kings 5:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Are</i> not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?</span> The "rivers of Damascus" are streams of great freshness and beauty. The principal one is the Barada, probably the Abaua of the present passage, which, rising in the Antilibanus range, and flowing through a series of romantic glens, bursts finally from the mountains through a deep gorge and scatters itself over the plain. One branch passes right through the city of Damascus, cutting it in half. Others flow past the city both on the north and on the south, irrigating the gardens and orchards, and spreading fertility far and wide over the Merj. A small stream, the Fidjeh, flows into the Barada from the north. Another quite independent river, the Awaaj. waters the southern portion of the Damascene plain, but does not approach within several miles of the city. Most geographers regard this as the "Pharpar;" but the identification is uncertain, since the name may very possibly have attached to one of the branches of the Barada. The Barada is limpid, cool, gushing, the perfection of a river: It was known to the Greeks and Romans as the Chrysorrhoas, or "river of gold." We can well understand that Naaman would esteem the streams of his own city as infinitely superior to the turbid, often sluggish, sometimes "clay-colored" (Robinson, ' Researches,' ver. 2. p. 256) Jordan. If leprosy was to be trashed away, it might naturally have appeared to him that the pure Barada would have more cleansing power than the muddy river recommended to him by the prophet. <span class="cmt_word">So he turned and went away in a rage.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, <i>if</i> the prophet had bid thee <i>do some</i> great thing, wouldest thou not have done <i>it</i>? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father.</span> Naaman's attendants did not share his indignation, or, if they did, since servants in the East are apt to be jealous of their masters' honor, had their feelings more under control; and they therefore inter-feted with mild words, anxious to pacify him, and persuade him to follow the prophet's advice. "My father" is a deferential and, at the same time, an affectionate address, not unnatural in the mouth of a confidential servant (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>). There is thus no need of any alteration of the text, such as Ewald (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) or Thenius (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) proposes.

It was like the flesh of a boy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a></div><div class="verse">And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that <i>there is</i> no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company.</span> It is not always seen what this involved. It involved going out of his way at least fifty miles. At the Jordan, Naaman was on his way home, had accomplished a fourth part of his return journey; in three more days he would be in Damascus, in his own palace. But he feels that it would be an unworthy act to accept his cure and make no acknowledgment of it, having turned away from the prophet "in a rage" (ver. 12), now, without apology, or retraction, or expression of regret or gratitude, to return into his own country under the obligation of an inestimable benefit. His cure has wrought in him, not merely a revulsion of feeling from rage and fury to thankfulness, but a change of belief. It has convinced him that the God of Elisha is the God of the whole earth. It has turned him from a worshipper of Rimmon into a worshipper of Jehovah. He must proclaim this. He must let the prophet know what is in his heart. He must, if possible, induce him to accept a recompense. Therefore he thinks nothing of an outlay of time and trouble, but retraces his steps to the Israelite capital, taking with him all his company, his horses and his chariots, his gold and silver and bales of clothing, and numerous train of attendants. <span class="cmt_word">And came, and stood before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> descended from his chariot, and asked admittance into the prophet's house, and was received and allowed an audience - a striking contrast with his previous appearance before the house, in expectation that the prophet would come down and wait upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel.</span> This is an acknowledgment of the sole supremacy of Jehovah on the part of a heathen, such as we scarcely find elsewhere. The general belief of the time, and indeed of antiquity, was that every land had its own god, who was supreme in it - Baal in Phoenicia, Che-mesh in Moab, Moloch in Ammon, Rimmon in Syria, Bel or Bel-Merodach in Babylon, Amun-Ra in Egypt, etc.; and when there is an acknowledgment of Jehovah on the part of heathens in Scripture, it is almost always the recognition of him as a god - the God of the Jews or of the Israelites, one among many (see <a href="../../par/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-26.htm">2 Kings 17:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>, etc.). But here we have a plain and distinct recognition of him as the one and only God that is in all the earth. Naaman thus shows a greater docility, a readier receptivity, than almost any of the other pious heathens who are brought before us in Scripture. Balaam and Cyrus alone equal him. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a present" - <span class="cmt_word">of thy servant.</span> Heathens were accustomed to carry presents to the oracles which they consulted, and to reward those from which they received favorable responses with gifts of enormous value (see Herod., 1:14, 50, etc.). The Jewish prophets did net generally object to such free-will offerings. Naaman therefore quite naturally and reasonably made the offer. He would have contravened usage had he not done so. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a></div><div class="verse">But he said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.

It was not compulsory on him so to act; for the precept, "Freely ye have received, freely give" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>), had not been yet uttered. Pious Israelites commonly brought gifts to the prophets whom they consulted (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>). But, in the case of a foreigner, ignorant hitherto of true religion, whom it was important to impress favorably, and, if possible, win over to the faith, Elisha deemed it advisable to take no reward. Naaman was thus taught that Jehovah was his true Healer, the prophet the mere instrument, and that it was to Jehovah that his gratitude, his thanks, and his offerings were due. <span class="cmt_word">And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</span> Contests of politeness are common in the East, where the one party offers to give and even insists on giving, while the other makes a pretence of declining; but here both parties were in earnest, and the gift was absolutely declined. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-17.htm">2 Kings 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?</span> Naaman does not state what he intends to do with the earth; and the critics have consequently suggested two uses. Some suppose that he intended to make the earth into an altar upon which he might offer his sacrifices; comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>, where an altar of earth is spoken of (Bahr and others). But the more general opinion (Thenius, Von Gerlach, etc.) is that he wished to spread the earth over a piece of Syrian ground, and thereby to hallow the ground for purposes of worship. The Jews themselves are known to have acted similarly, transferring earth from Jerusalem to Babylonia, to build a temple on it; and the idea is not an unnatural one, It does not necessarily imply the "polytheistic superstition" that every god has his own laud, where alone he can be properly worshipped. It rests simply on the notion of there being such a thing as "holy ground" (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>) - ground more suited for the worship of God than ordinary common soil, which therefore it is worth while to transfer from place to place for a religious purpose. <span class="cmt_word">For thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice</span> [as meat offerings or firstfruits] <span class="cmt_word">unto other gods, but unto the Lord.</span> It is implied that Naaman had been hitherto a polytheist. Not much is known of the Syrian religion, but, so far as can be gathered, it would seem to have been a somewhat narrow polytheism. The sun was the supreme god, and was worshipped ordinarily under the name of Hadad (Ma-crob, 'Sat.,' 1:23). There was also, certainly, a great goddess, the "Dea Syra" of the Romans, whom they identified with Cybele and with their own "Bona Dea," a divinity parallel with the Ashtoreth of the Phoenicians, and the Ishtar of the Assyrians and Babylonians. Whether there were any other distinct deities may be doubted, since Bitumen is possibly only another name of Hadad (see the comment on ver. 18). Adonis is simply "Adonai," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my Lord," an epithet of the Supreme Being. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, <i>that</i> when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant.</span> Naaman is not prepared to be a martyr for his religion. On returning to Damascus, it will be among his civil duties to accompany his master to the national temples, and to prostrate himself before the images of the national deities. If he declines, if (like an early Christian) he will not enter "the house of devils," much less bow down before the graven image of a false god, it may cost him his life; it will certainly cost him his court favor. For such a sacrifice he is not prepared. Yet his conscience tells him that he will be acting wrongly. He therefore expresses a hope, or a prayer, that his fault, for a fault he feels that it will be, may be forgiven him - that Jehovah will not be "extreme to mark what is done amiss," but will excuse his outward conformity to his inward faith and zeal. That <span class="cmt_word">when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon.</span> Riminon is probably derived from <span class="accented">rum</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>), "to be high," and means "the exalted god," according to the gloss of He-sychins -  <span class="greek">&#x3a1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. It is wrongly connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "a pomegranate," and should rather be compared with the Arabic <span class="accented">Er Rhaman</span>, "the Most High." The royal name, "Tab-Bitumen" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), contains the root, as does also the local name (<a href="../../par/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>), "Hadad-Rimmon." This last word gives rise to the suspicion that Hadad and Rimmon are merely two names of the same deity, who was called "Hadad" or "Hadar" as bright and glorious, "Rim-men" as lofty and exalted. <span class="cmt_word">To worship there, and he leaneth on my hand</span>. Either Naaman's leprosy must have been recent, and he refers to the king's practice in former times, or there must have been far less horror of leprosy among the Syrians than there was among the Hebrews. And I bow myself in the house of Rimmon - before the image, or at any rate before the supposed presence of the god - <span class="cmt_word">when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing.</span> The repetition of the clause indicates Naaman's anxiety on the subject. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-19.htm">2 Kings 5:19</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him; Go in peace.</span> Elisha declared neither that God would nor that he would net forgive Naaman his departure from the path of strict right. He was not called upon to give an answer, since Naaman had not put a question, but had only expressed a wish. His Go in peace is to be taken simply as "wishing the departing Syrian the peace of God upon the road." So Keil, rightly. <span class="cmt_word">So he departed from him a little way.</span> Naaman left the presence of Elisha, quitted Samaria, and had gone a short way on his homeward journey when Gehazi overtook him. Ver. 19 is closely connected with ver. 20.

But experience teaches us that religious formulae do drop from the lips of persons engaged in equally indefensible proceedings. This is partly because formulae by frequent use become mere forms, to which the utterer attaches no meaning; partly because men blind themselves to the wrongfulness of their actions, and find some excuse or other for any course of conduct by which they hope to profit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/5-21.htm">2 Kings 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">So Gehazi followed after Naaman.

Thus Gehazi, if he went at his best speed, could expect to overtake, and did actually overtake, the cavalcade of Naaman. He probably overtook them at a very short distance from Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And when Naaman saw him running after him.</span> Gehazi was pressed for time. He could not start at once, lest he should make it too plain that he was going m pursuit of Naaman; and he could not absent himself from the house too long, lest his master should call for him. He had, therefore, at whatever loss of dignity, to hurry himself, and actually "run after" the Syrian. Naaman, either accidentally looking back, or warned by some of his train, sees him, recognizes him, and is only too glad to respond to his wishes. <span class="cmt_word">He lighted down from the chariot to meet him.</span> An act of great condescension. As Bahr notes, "Descent from a vehicle is, in the East, a sign of respect from the inferior to the superior;" and Naaman, in lighting down from his chariot, must have intended to "honor the prophet in his servant" ('Commentary on Kings,' vol. 2. p. 55). But such honor is not commonly paid, and thus the act of Naaman was abnormal. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Is all well?</span> The words admit of no better translation. Seeing Gehazi's haste and anxious looks, Naaman suspects that all is <span class="accented">not</span> well, that something has happened since he left the prophet's house, and accordingly puts his question, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5be;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>?

Ewald regards <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, "my heart," as designating Gehazi, and meaning "my loved one, my favorite disciple." "Thou hast denied that thou wentest any whither; but did not my favorite disciple in truth go forth, when the man turned again from his chariot, as Naaman did?" (ver. 21). But no parallel instance can be adduced of any such use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, which is altogether too strong a term to be applied to a mere favorite servant. The irony, moreover, of the term under the circumstances would be too great. Maurer's interpretation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> by "my prophetic power" (my prophetic power had not departed from me) is no better, since it requires <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> to be taken in two different senses in the two most closely connected clauses of vers. 25 and 26. Altogether, our version would seem to be the best rendering that has been suggested. It accords with the Septuagint, with Theodoret, and with the Vulgate; and it gives a satisfactory sense: "Did not my spirit go forth with thee when thou wentest forth, etc.? Was I not present in spirit during the whole transaction?" <span class="cmt_word">When the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?</span> (see ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</span> The prophet follows Gehazi's thoughts, which had been to purchase, with the money obtained from Naaman, olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, etc.; and asks - Was this a time for such proceedings? Keil well explains, "Was this the time, when so many hypocrites pretend to be prophets from selfishness and avarice, and bring the prophetic office into contempt with unbelievers, for a servant of the true God to take money and goods from a non-Israelite... that he might acquire property and luxury for himself?" It was evidently a most unfit time. As Thenius says, "In any other case better than in this mightest thou have yielded to thy desire for gold and goods."
