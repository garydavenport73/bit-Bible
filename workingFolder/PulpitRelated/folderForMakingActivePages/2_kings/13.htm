The proof is given at somewhat tedious length by Keil ('Biblical Commentary,' pp. 373, 374) and Bahr ('Books of the Kings,' pp. 139, 140). It seems unnecessary to enter into a lengthy discussion of the point, since all the synchronisms of the later kings of Israel and Judah are in confusion, and appear to be the work of a later hand. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Ahaziah</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>) <span class="cmt_word">King of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">reigned over Israel</span>. The "later hand," which inserted the synchronism, neglected to bring the two portions of the verse into agreement. Our translators have sought to cover up his omission by translating <span class="accented">malak</span> "began to <span class="accented">reign</span>," and then supplying "and reigned" in the next clause. And reigned <span class="cmt_word">seventeen years</span> (so also Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-2.htm">2 Kings 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> There is no reason to believe that Jehoahaz re-introduced the Baal-worship, or sinned in any other flagrant way than by maintaining the calf-worship at Dan and Bethel. Jehu had done the same (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>), as had all previous kings of Israel from the time of Jeroboam. The honor of God, however, required that idolatry of whatever kind should be punished, and the Samaritan kingdom could not otherwise be saved from destruction than by, "casting away <span class="accented">all</span> the works of darkness" and returning to the <span class="accented">pure</span> worship of Jehovah. Hence Jehu himself, notwithstanding the good service that he had done in crushing the Baal-worship, was chastised by God (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>) on account of his continuance in the "sin of Jeroboam;" and now Jehoahaz was even more signally punished. As Keil remarks, "The longer and the more obstinately the sin was continued, the more severe did the punishment become." <span class="cmt_word">And followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>, where the exegetical clause is added, "To wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan") <span class="cmt_word">which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-26.htm">1 Kings 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-19.htm">1 Kings 16:19, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>, etc.); he departed not therefrom. This is emphatic. Jehoahaz kept up the worship to the full, and in no way suffered it to decline. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all <i>their</i> days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.</span> We know so much less of the nature of the calf-worship and of the rites which accompanied it, that we cannot to the same extent justify the Divine severity in connection with it as in connection with the Baal and Astarte cult. Still, we must remember the coarse, lewd dancing which accompanied the first calf-worship (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>), for which death was not thought too heavy a penalty (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>), and the almost universal combination of unchastity with idolatrous ceremonies, which raises a suspicion that those who frequented the shrines at Dan and Bethel were not wholly innocent of impurity. <span class="cmt_word">And he delivered them into the hand of Hazel King of Syria.</span> The national sins of Israel were mostly punished in this way, by the sword of some foreign foe. Hazael had been already made an instrument for the chastisement of Jehu (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>). Now he was to chastise Jehoahaz still more severely. <span class="cmt_word">And into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all the days</span>. Not certainly all the days of the two kings Hazael and Benhadad, for Benhadad was entirely worsted in his war with Joash (vers. 24, 25), but either all the days of Jehoahaz, or all the days that God had appointed for the duration of the calamity. It is perhaps against the former interpretation that Hazael appears to have outlived Jehoahaz (vers. 22-24); but Ben-hadad may have warred against him as his father's general (ver. 25) during his father's lifetime. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoahaz besought the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">besought the face of the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). Jehoahaz, as Josephus says, "betook him-serf to prayer and supplication of God, entreating that he would deliver him out of the hands of Hazael, and not suffer him to continue subject" ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 5). He did not turn from his sin of idolatry, perhaps did not suspect that it was this sin which had provoked God's anger; but in a general way he repented, humbled himself, and besought God's mercy and assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hearkened unto him.</span> God accepted his repentance, all imperfect as it was, so far as to save the people from the entire destruction with which it was threatened by the severe measures of Hazael (ver. 7), to continue the national existence (ver. 23), and ultimately to restore the national prosperity (ver. 25 and <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-27</a>). But he did not remove the oppression, as Josephus imagines, in Jehoahaz's time. Ver. 22 makes this fact absolutely certain. <span class="cmt_word">For he saw the oppression of Israel, because the King of Syria oppressed them.</span> Oppression is always hateful to God, even when he is using it as his instrument for chastising or punishing a guilty people. He "sees" it, notes it, lays it up in his remembrance for future retribution (camp. <a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>, etc.). (On the nature and extent of the oppression of this period, see ver. 7, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.)

The special "deliverer" was probably in the mind of the writer, Jeroboam II., by whom he says, in ch. 14:27, that God "saved" Israel; but Joash, who began the deliverance (ver. 25), may also be glanced at, <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel dwelt in their tents.</span> Here, as so often elsewhere (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-12.htm">2 Kings 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-7.htm">Zechariah 12:7</a>), the word "tents" is a mere archaism for "abodes, houses." Israel had dwelt in tents until the going down into Egypt, and again from the time of quitting Egypt to the entrance into Canaan; and thus the word <span class="accented">ohel had ac</span>quired a secondary meaning of "abode," "dwelling-place." In the time which followed on the deliverance from the Syrian yoke, the Israelites of the ten tribes were no longer engaged in marches and countermarches, in battles, skirmishes, or sieges, but quietly abode in their several houses. <span class="cmt_word">As beforetime</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. as in</span> the peaceful time before the attacks of Hazael began.

Thenius would cancel it. <span class="cmt_word">But walked therein</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he walked</span>. But here again a corruption may be suspected. Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span> we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which lost its final letter in consequence of the <span class="accented">vau</span> that immediately followed it. <span class="cmt_word">And there remained the grove also in Samaria.</span> "The grove in Samaria" was that idolatrous emblem which Ahab had set up at Jezebel's suggestion (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>), the nature of which has been much disputed. Some think that it was "an image of Astarte" (see 'Homiletic Commentary' on 1 Kings, p. 374); but more probably it was a mere emblem, analogous to the Assyrian "sacred tree." Its material may sometimes have been wood, but was perhaps more usually metal. The mistranslation "grove" originated with the Septuagint translators, who uniformly rendered <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It is surprising that Jehu did not destroy the <span class="accented">asherah</span> together with the other idolatrous erections of Ahab in Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26-28</a>); but, for some reason or other, it seems to have been spared, and to have been still standing. So long as it stood, even if it did not attract the religious regards of any, it would be a standing dishonor to God, and would so increase the sin of the nation. Hence its mention in this passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen.</span> This verse seems to be an exegetical note on ver. 4, which perhaps it once followed immediately, the parenthetic section (vers. 5 and 6) having been added later, as an afterthought, either by the original writer, or perhaps by a later hand. The meaning seems to be that Hazael limited the standing army of Jehoahaz to fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, not that he slew the entire military population except this small remnant. The policy of limiting the forces to be maintained by a subject-king was one known to the Romans, and has often been adopted in the East. It is still a part of our own policy in the government of India. The limitation left the country at the mercy of all its neighbors (see ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">For the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</span> Possibly this means no more than an utter destruction - a trampling in the dust, as we phrase it (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12, 13</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>). But it may be an allusion to that destruction of prisoners by means of a threshing instrument, which was certainly sometimes practiced (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>), and which is made a special charge against Damascus (<a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. See Pusey's 'Minor Prophets,' p. 158).

The regular use of the phrase is one of the indications that the two Books of the Kings are by one author, and form one book. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-9.htm">2 Kings 13:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers</span>; and they buried him in Samaria (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-28.htm">1 Kings 16:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-35.htm">2 Kings 10:35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-13.htm">2 Kings 13:13</a>, etc.). The kings of Israel from the time of Omri were buried in the capital, Samaria, as those of Judah were in Jerusalem. It is uncertain whether they had one common mausoleum, like the kings of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a>), but it is most probable that they had. To rest with their fathers in the same royal sepulcher was to be duly honored at their death; to be excluded from it was a disgrace. <span class="cmt_word">And Joash his son reigned in his stead.</span>

The writer passes from the reign of Jehoahaz, Jehu's son, to that of Joash, Jehu's grandson, which he seems to have intended at first to dispatch in the short space of four verses (vers. 10-13). He afterwards, however, saw reason to add to his narrative, first, an account of an interview between Joash and Elisha, shortly Before the death of the latter (vers. 14-19); secondly, an account of a miracle wrought soon afterwards by means of Elisha's corpse (vers. 20, 21); and thirdly, a brief notice of Joash's Syrian war (vers. 22-25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and seventh year of Joash King of Judah.</span> Three years before his death, since he reigned forty years  (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>). The two Joashes were thus contemporary monarchs for the space of three years. <span class="cmt_word">Began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign ever Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.</span> The construction is the same as that of ver. 1, and is equally ungrammatical. Our translators again amend the faulty phrase by introducing the words "and reigned" The "sixteen years" of the reign of Joash are confirmed by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 6), but still present some difficulty (see the comment on 2 Kings 14:23). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-11.htm">2 Kings 13:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: <i>but</i> he walked therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin; but he walked therein.</span> Josephus says that Joash was a good king, and quite unlike his father in disposition ('Ant. Jud.,' <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>); but he is not likely to have had any independent data for judging of his character. Our author seems to include both son and father in the same category (comp. ver. 2). The narrative contained in ver. 14 is probably the foundation of the historian's favorable judgment.

The name means, "he whose people is many," and was thus anticipative of that great enlargement of the Israelite kingdom, which took place under him (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel</span> (see the comment on ver. 9).

In the East, and at the period of which the historian is treating, it was probably unprecedented. Prophets waited upon kings, not kings upon prophets: If a king came to a prophet's house, it was likely to be on an errand of vengeance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>), not on one of kindness and sympathy. The act of Joash certainly implies a degree of tenderness and consideration on tits part very uncommon at the time, and is a fact to which much weight should be attached in any estimate that we form of his character. He was, at any rate, a prince of an amiable disposition. <span class="cmt_word">And wept over his face</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, leant over the sick man as he lay on his bed, and shed tears, some of which fell on him - <span class="cmt_word">and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</span> As Elisha had addressed Elijah, when he was quitting the earth (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>), so Joash now addressed the dying Elisha, using exactly the same words, not (certainly) by a mere coincidence. Joash must have known the circumstances of Elijah's departure, which had probably been entered before this in the 'Book of the Kings,' and intended pointedly to allude to them. "O my father, my father," he meant to say, "when Elijah was taken from the earth, thou didst exclaim that the defense of Israel was gone" (see the comment on 2 Kings 2:12): "how much more must it be true that it is gone now, when thou art on the point of departure!

The defense of Israel would not fail because he  - a mere weak instrument by whom God had been pleased to work - was taken from the earth. God would bless the king's own efforts. "Take bow and arrows," he exclaims under the prophetic afflatus. "Take them at once into thine hands, and do my bidding." Words would not have been enough; greater assurance and conviction was produced when prophecy took the shape of a symbolical action (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-3.htm">Jeremiah 18:3, 4</a>, etc.). So the Spirit of the Lord moved the prophet to the performance of a symbolical act, or set of acts, which the historian now proceeds to describe. <span class="cmt_word">And he took unto him how and arrows.</span> Joash would take these from the hands of his attendants, who might be carrying his own special weapons after him, as was the practice in Persia ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. p. 161), or who would at any rate have arms of their own, since they would wait upon him not merely as attendants, but as guards.

The intention was, no doubt, as Keil says, "to show that the power which was to be given to the bow-shot" was not the king's own power, but "came from the Lord through the mediation of his prophet."

The prophet ordered the shutter to be opened, that the king might shoot from the window. He addressed, not the king, whose hands were both engaged, but his own servant, or one of the royal attendants. <span class="cmt_word">Eastward</span>. Not so much in the direction of Syria, which was north-east of the Israelite territory, as in the direction of Gilead and Bashan, which had been the scene of Hazael's victories (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>), and was now to be the scene of his reverses. Aphek lay almost duo east of Shunem, where it is probable that Elisha was. <span class="cmt_word">And he opened it</span>; or, <span class="accented">and one opened it</span>, or <span class="accented">they opened it</span>. The Hebrew idiom allows of this <span class="accented">indefinite</span> use of the third person singular. <span class="cmt_word">Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Elisha - <span class="cmt_word">said, The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria</span>; rather, <span class="accented">an arrow</span>. "This is," the prophet meant to say, "an arrow symbolical of deliverance about to come from Jehovah, of deliverance from the cruel oppression of the Syrians" - and not merely of deliverance, but of victory. <span class="cmt_word">For thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek.</span> The Aphek intended is probably that which lay east of the Sea of Galilee, at the distance of about three miles, in lat. 32&deg; 49' nearly. This place was on the direct route between Samaria and Damascus, and had already been the scene of one great victory gained by Israel over Syria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26-30</a>). The site is marked by the modern village of <span class="accented">Fik</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Till thou have consumed them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till consuming - i.e.</span>, till the army which thou shalt defeat at that place is destroyed utterly. We have no account of the fulfillment of this prophecy, but may regard the defeat as one of those touched on in ver. 25.

Keil and Bahr, on the contrary, think that the order was to shoot the arrows down from the window and hit the earth with them. But some contrast seems to be intended between the "shoot" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 19 and the "strike" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>) of the present passage. Ewald's explanation is thus to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">And he smote thrice, and stayed.</span> Joash struck with the arrows against the floor three times, and then paused, thinking he had done enough. He did not enter into the spirit of the symbolical act, which represented the smiting and slaying of enemies. Perhaps he had not much faith in the virtue of the symbolism, which he may even, with the arrogance of a proud and worldly minded man, have thought childish. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-19.htm">2 Kings 13:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed <i>it</i>: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria <i>but</i> thrice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">was wroth with him.</span> Elisha was angered at the lukewarmness of Joash, and his lack of faith and zeal. He himself, from his higher standpoint, saw the greatness of the opportunity, the abundance of favor which God was ready to grant, and the way in which God's favor was stinted and narrowed by Joash's want of receptiveness. Had the king been equal to the occasion, a full end might at once have been made of Syria, and Israel might have been enabled to brace herself for the still more perilous struggle with Assyria, in which she ultimately succumbed. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it.</span> It has been suggested that Joash associated the number throe with the notion of completeness, and "thought that what was done thrice was done perfectly" (Bahr); but in this case the prophet would scarcely have been angered. It is far more consonant with the entire narrative to suppose that he stopped from mere weariness, and want of strong faith and zeal. If he had been earnestly desirous of victory, and had had faith in the symbolical action as divinely directed, he would have kept on smiting till the prophet told him it was enough, or at any rate would have smitten the ground five or six times instead of three. The idea that he abstained from modesty or from prudence, "lest too extravagant demands might deprive him of all" (Von Gerlach), finds no support in the text of the narrative. He abstained (as Keil says) because "he was wanting in the proper zeal for obtaining the full promises of God." Had it been otherwise, the complete success obtained by Jeroboam II. (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-25.htm">2 Kings 4:25-28</a>) might have been anticipated by the space of fifteen or twenty years. <span class="cmt_word">Whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice</span> (comp. ver. 25, which declares that this prophecy was exactly accomplished). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/13-20.htm">2 Kings 13:20</a></div><div class="verse">And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha died, and they buried him.</span> There had been no burial of Elijah, who" went up by a whirlwind into heaven" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). All the more anxious, therefore, would the Israelites be to bury their second great prophet with due honor. They prepared him, no doubt, one of those excavated sepulchers which were usual at the time and in the country - a squared or vaulted chamber cut in the native rock. St. Jerome says that the place of his sepulture was near Samaria ('Epitaph. Paulae'), and this is sufficiently probable; but in the Middle Ages his grave was shown at Ruma, in Galilee (Ewald, 'Hist. of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 122, note 3). According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 6), his funeral was magnificent. <span class="cmt_word">And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</span> It seems to be implied that this was a usual occurrence. Just as the Syrians in the days of Naaman made marauding raids into the land from time to time (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2</a>), so now the Moabites each spring made an incursion. The weakness of Israel is strongly marked by this fact, and still more by the penetration of the Moabites so deep into their country. <a href="../../par/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a> perhaps glances at these incursions of Moab.

Hastily, and somewhat roughly, it may be, the bearers of the body thrust it into Elisha's tomb, which happened to be at hand, and from the mouth of which they were able to remove the closing stone. They did not "throw" the body in, but pushed it in. <span class="cmt_word">And when the man was let down.</span> The man was not "let down." Our translators seem to have been unacquainted with the Jewish mode of burial. They imagine that Elisha's tomb is a pit dug in the ground from the surface downwards, like a modern grave, and the man has therefore to be "let <span class="accented">down</span>," or to "go <span class="accented">down"</span> (marginal translation) into it. The Revised Version avoids the mistranslation, but weakens the force of the original. Translate, <span class="accented">and when the man came</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And touched the bones of Elisha, he revived.</span> The violent push given to the corpse imparted to it a movement which brought it in contact with the bones, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the body (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-31.htm">1 Kings 13:31</a>) of Elisha, as it lay, wound in its grave-clothes, but uncoffined, on the floor of the sepulchral chamber. At the moment of contact the dead man came to life  - "revived." <span class="cmt_word">And stood up on his feet.</span> In many Jewish tombs the sepulchral chamber would allow of this.

He had, in vers. 14-19, dwelt upon the promises of victory given by the prophet to Joash. He is now bent on relating their fulfillment. But before doing so he recapitulates.
