She was married to Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, probably in the lifetime of his father, to cement the alliance concluded between Ahab and Jehoshaphat against the Syrians (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>). She inherited much of her mother Jezebel's character, obtained an unlimited ascendancy over her husband, Jehoram, and kept her son Ahaziah in leading-strings. It was unquestionably through her influence that Jehoram was prevailed upon to introduce the Baal-worship into Judah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-5.htm">2 Chronicles 2:5, 11</a>), and Ahaziah prevailed upon to maintain it (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-27.htm">2 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3</a>, "He also Talked in the ways of the house of Ahab: <span class="accented">for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly"</span>). On the death of Ahaziah, she found her position seriously imperiled. The crown would have passed naturally to one of her grandchildren, the eldest of the sons of Ahaziah. She would have lost her position of <span class="accented">gebirah</span>, or queen mother, which would have passed to the widow of Ahaziah, the mother of the new sovereign. If she did not at once lose all influence, at any rate a counter-influence to hers would have been established; and this might well have been that of the high priest, who was closely connected by marriage with the royal family. Under these circumstances, she took the bold resolution described in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">She arose and destroyed the seed royal.</span> She issued her orders, and had all the members of the house of David on whom she could lay her hands put to death. The royal house had already been greatly depleted by Jehoram's murder of his brothers (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>), by Arab marauders (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>), and by Jehu's murder of the "brethren of Ahaziah" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-14.htm">2 Kings 10:14</a>); but it is clear that Ahaziah had left several sons behind him, and some of his "brethren" had also, in all probability, left issue. There may also have been many other descendants of David in Judah, belonging to other branches of the house than that of Rehoboam. Athaliah, no doubt, endeavored to make a clean sweep, and get rid of them all.

His tender age, probably, moved her compassion, and induced her to select him from the rest. <span class="cmt_word">And they hid him: even him and his nurse.</span> The order in the Hebrew is, "even him and his nurse, and they hid him," which clears the sense. Jehosheba stole away Joash and his nurse, and they, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehosheba and the nurse together, hid him between them. <span class="cmt_word">In the bedchamber</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the</span> chamber <span class="accented">of mattresses - a</span> room in the palace where mattresses, and perhaps coverlets, were stored.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-3.htm">2 Kings 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was with her</span> - he, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Joash, was with her, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehosheba, his aunt - hid in the house of the Lord; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the temple. We learn from Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>) that Jehosheba was married to Jehoiada, the high priest, and would thus have ready access to the temple. We must suppose that, after a few days' concealment in the "chamber of mattresses," Jehosheba found an opportunity of transferring him, with his nurse, to a chamber in the temple, where he was thenceforward nourished and brought up. There were various chambers in the temple used for secular purposes, as we learn from <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-8</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5-9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Six years</span> (comp. ver. 21 and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Athaliah did reign over the land.</span> It is difficult to realize all that this implies. It cannot mean less than that for six years Baalism was triumphant in Judah  - the temple was allowed to fall into decay (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>) - a temple to Baal was erected in Jerusalem itself, to supersede the temple of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), and a high priest appointed to be a rival to the successor of Aaron. Whether persecution was indulged in, as under Jehoram (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>), is uncertain; but the servants of Jehovah were at any rate under a cloud, slighted, contemned, held as of small account. Perhaps we may conclude, from the position occupied by Jehoiada, and from the powers which he was able to exercise when he determined on revolt (ver. 4; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1, 2</a>), that Athaliah, during her six years' reign, was to some extent held in check by a Jehovistic party, which she knew to exist, and which she did not dare openly to defy. Thus she left Jehoiada (apparently) in possession of the temple, of its treasures and its armory (ver. 10); she allowed the temple service to continue (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>); she permitted the priests and the Levites to serve in their regular "courses" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>); she let the fortress of the eastern city - for the temple was always a fortress  - remain in her enemies' hands. Still, the time was evidently one "of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy" the oppressed worshippers of Jehovah were greatly discontented; and the nation generally was ripe for a counter-revolution, so soon as the signal was given by an authority whom they could trust. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Conspiracy of Jehoiada</span>. After waiting, impatiently we may be sure, for six long years, and seeing the young prince grow from an infant to a boy of seven years of age, Jehoiada deemed that the time was come to venture on an effort. It was necessary for him to make his arrangements beforehand with great care. His first step was to sound the captains of the royal guard. To these men, five in number (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), he sent secretly, and in-wired them to confer with him in the temple on important business. Finding them well disposed to adopt his views, he revealed to them the fact that Joash had escaped the massacre of Ahaziah's sons, and was still living, even allowing them to see him. The result of the interview was that they put themselves at Jehoiada's disposal, and agreed to take their orders from him (ver. 4). Jehoiada then proceeded to his second step. Either distrusting the body-guard which the captains commanded, or regarding it as insufficient in numbers, he gave them orders to visit the various cities of Judea, and collect from them a strong force of Levites and other trusty persons, and bring them to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), where he would give them their orders. This was done successfully, and, as it would seem, without in any way rousing the suspicions of Athaliah. A day was fixed for proclaiming Joash king; the guard and the Levites were skillfully disposed about the temple and the palace; the king was brought up, crowned, anointed, and saluted as monarch, with noisy acclamations (ver. 12). The noise was heard in the palace, and Athaliah went forth, with a few attendants, to inquire the reason of it. Following the sound, she came to the temple, and entered it, when she saw what was going on, and cried out, "Treason! Treason!" By Jehoiada's order the guards seized her, conducted her out of the temple, and slew her (vers. 13-16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh year</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and in the seventh year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the course of it  - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds,</span> <span class="cmt_word">with the captains and the guard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the captains over hundreds</span> (or, centurions) <span class="accented">of the Carites and the guard</span> (see the Revised Version). The "Carites," here first named, are generally regarded as identical with the Cherethites of earlier times (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>). They were undoubtedly a particular portion of the royal guard, and may, perhaps, as many suppose, have been "Caftan" mercenaries, though we have no other evidence that the Carians had adopted the mercenary life so early as the time of Athaliah. Still, as their devotion to it had passed into a proverb when Archilochus wrote (B.C. 700-660), it is quite possible that they had begun the practice a century or two earlier. When Jehoiada is said to have "sent and fetched" the centurions, we must understand that he secretly invited them, and that they consented to come. He could not possibly have any authority over them, so as to require their attendance. The names of the five centurions, together with their fathers' names, were put on record by the writer of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), whose account of the revolution is in many respects fuller than that in Kings. <span class="cmt_word">And brought them to him into the house of the Lord</span> - as the safest place for an interview which had to be kept secret from the queen - <span class="cmt_word">and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the Lord.</span> We can easily understand that the soldiers, who had been willing to serve Athaliah under the notion that the house of David was extinct, might waver in their allegiance so soon as they heard that a scion of the old royal stock survived, and could be produced at a moment's notice. Their traditions would attach them to David and his seed, not to the house of Ahab. <span class="cmt_word">And showed them the king's son.</span> Having bound the centurions by a solemn covenant to the cause of the young king, Jehoiada introduced them into his presence. He had, no doubt, previously sworn them to secrecy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he commanded them, saying, This <i>is</i> the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do.</span> It is evident, from 2 Chronicles and from Josephus, that a considerable interval of time separates the events of ver. 5 from those of ver. 4. The <span class="accented">immediate</span> arrangement made between Jehoiada and the centurions was that they should "go throughout the whole land" (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 2), visit "all the cities of Judah" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), and gather out of them a strong force of Levites and priests (Josephus), together with a certain number of other representative Israelites, which force they should bring with them to Jerusalem, and place at his disposal. To accomplish this must have taken some weeks. When the force had arrived, Jehoiada summoned it to meet him in the courts of the temple, and swore it to a similar covenant to that which he had made with the centurions. He then bided his time, completed his arrangements, utilized the store of arms laid up in the temple armory (ver. 10), and finally gave two charges - one to the centurions, which is given here (vers. 5-8), and the other to the force collected from the cities of Judah, which is given in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>). The orders given to the two forces were very similar, but not identical. <span class="cmt_word">A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath.</span> The royal body-guard consisted of five divisions, each probably of a hundred men, and each commanded by its own captain (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>). It was usual on the sabbath for three divisions out of the five to mount guard at the royal palace, while two were engaged outside, keeping order in the city, and especially at the temple. We do not know the ordinary disposition of the guard, either inside or outside the palace. On this occasion Jehoiada commanded that the palace-guard should be disposed as follows: one division at the palace proper, in the courts and halls and antechambers; a second at one of the issues from the palace, known as "the gate of Sur;" and a third at an issue called "the gate of the guard," which was certainly towards the east, where the palace fronted the temple. The object was to secure the palace, but not to prevent the queen from leaving it. <span class="cmt_word">Shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the royal palace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">And a third part <i>shall be</i> at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur.</span> The "gate of Sur" is not elsewhere mentioned. It seems to be called in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>) "the gate of the foundation" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>) instead of "the gate of Sur" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>), as here - the one reading having evidently arisen out of the other by a corruption. We must understand one of the <span class="accented">palace</span> gates, but which of them is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">And a third part at the gate behind the guard</span>; called in ver. 19 "the gate of the <span class="accented">guard</span>," and shown there to have been on the <span class="accented">cast</span> side of the palace, where it faced the temple, and abutted on the Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">So shall ye keep the watch of the house</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the "king's house," or palace, which is contrasted with the "house of the Lord" of the next verse - <span class="cmt_word">that it be not broken down.</span> This rendering is scarcely accepted at the present time by any writers. Ewald renders, "according to custom;" Keil, "for defense;" Furst, "alternately;" our Revisers, "and be a barrier." The Hebrew word used occurs nowhere else, and it seems impossible to determine its sense. The LXX. simply omit it.

The order was that if any one entered the temple, and attempted to break through the ranks of the guard, either in front of the king or behind him, he should instantly be put to death.

The Chronicler, writing much later, gives Jehoiada the title on the first occasion that he mentions him (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>). When it is said that "<span class="accented">all</span> the captains took their men and came to Jehoiada," the intention is to mark their exact obedience to the orders given them. Strictly speaking, only two out of the five actually appeared before Jehoiada on the day of the execution of his project, two divisions only having been summoned to come to the temple (ver. 7). The other three took up the positions assigned them in and about the royal palace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that <i>were</i> in the temple of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give King David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the Lord.</span> We hear of David carrying with him to Jerusalem the "shields of gold," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shields ornamented with gold, which he took from the servants of Hadadezer (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>); but otherwise we are not told of his establishing an armory. Solomon made six hundred shields of solid gold, and laid them up in the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>); but these were carried off by Sheshonk, when he invaded Judaea in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>). Rehoboam, in their place, made three hundred brazen shields (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>), which, however, were deposited in the guard-chamber of the royal palace. Of spears collected by David, and laid up in the temple, we know nothing beyond the present passage. There can be little doubt that the weapons were brought forth from their receptacle with the view (as Ewald says) of "consecrating the work of the restoration of the Davidic house with the sacred arms of the great founder himself" (see 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136) - not, however, with arms that he had worn, but with some which he had collected and laid up.

And the temple. "The temple" is here the sanctuary, as in the passage of Chronicles just quoted. The guard occupied a position at the upper end of the court, immediately in front of the altar and the temple porch.

The crown was probably a band of gold, either plain or set with jewels (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a>), fastened behind with a riband. It receives here the same name that is given to the high priest's diadem in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a> and Exodus 39:30. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him the testimony.</span> The words "gave him" are not in the original, and are superfluous. What is meant plainly is that the high priest laid on the young king's head a copy of the Law, or of some essential portion of it, perhaps the Decalogue, which is often called "the testimony" (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16, 21</a>, etc.). The object apparently was to show that the king was to rule by law, not arbitrarily - that he was to be, as Dean Stanley says, "not above, but beneath, the law of his country" ('Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 397). The ceremony seems to have been a new one, and is indicative of the gradual curtailment of the regal power under the later monarchy. <span class="cmt_word">And they made him king, and anointed him.</span> A change is made from the singular to the plural, because, as we learn from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-11.htm">2 Chronicles 23:11</a>, "Jehoiada <span class="accented">and his</span> sons anointed him." We have had no mention of the anointing of a new monarch in Judah since the time of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>).

The gate intended can scarcely be the "horse gate" of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a>, which was in the eastern wall, and north of the temple. It was probably a gate on the western side of the Tyropoeon valley, giving entrance to the stables of the palace (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-15.htm">2 Chronicles 23:15</a>, and see below, ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">And there was she slain</span>; "with the sword" (ver. 20).

Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 4), But, if this was the case, it is rather strange that the writer of Chronicles, who enumerates so many of the evil acts of Jehoram (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4, 6, 11</a>), does not mention it. The present narrative shows that the temple was in, or very near, Jerusalem; but there is nothing to fix the site of it. <span class="cmt_word">And brake it down</span> - Josephus says they "razed it to the ground" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly.</span> It was common among the heathen to have several altars in one temple, and not uncommon to have several images even of the same god, especially if he was a god worshipped under different forms, as Baal was (whence the word "Baalim"). The Baalim of this temple are mentioned by the writer of Chronicles (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</span> The name "Mattan" recalls that of the last King of Judah, which was originally Mattaniah, equivalent to "gift of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Mattan would be simply "gift."

We are there told that "Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests the Levites... to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in." During Athaliah's reign the temple service had ceased; breaches had been broken in the outer walls; and neither the priests nor the porters had served in their regular order; there had been no morning or evening sacrifice, and no antiphonal psalm-singing. Jehoiada re-established the regular courses and the worship.
