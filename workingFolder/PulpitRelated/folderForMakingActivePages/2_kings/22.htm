The writer of Kings, bent on abbreviating as much as possible, omits the early reforms of Josiah, which are related in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3-7</a>, with perhaps some anticipation of what happened later. The young king gave marked indications of personal piety and attachment to true religion as early as the eighth year of his reign, when he was sixteen, and had just attained his majority (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 232, note). Later, in his twelfth year, he began the purging of the temple and of Jerusalem, at the same time probably commencing the repairs spoken of in ver. 9. Jeremiah's prophesying, begun in the same or in the next year (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>), must have been a powerful assistance to his reformation. <span class="cmt_word">That the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the Lord, saying.</span> Shaphan held the office, which Shebna had held in the later part of Hezekiah's reign (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>), an office of much importance and dignity. According to the author of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>), there were associated with him on this occasion two other personages of importance, viz. Maaseiah, the governor of the city (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>), and Joah the son of Joahaz, the "recorder," or "remembrancer."

When Shaphan had transacted with Hilkiah the business entrusted to him by the king, Hilkiah took the opportunity of sending word by him to the king with respect to a discovery that he had recently made, during the investigations connected with the repairs. He had found a book, which he called without any doubt or hesitation, "the book of the Law" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>  - and this book he put into the hands of Shaphan, who "read it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some of it, and found it of such importance that he took it back with him to the palace, and read a portion to the king. Hereupon the king "rent his clothes," and required that special inquiry should be made of the Lord concerning the words of the book, and particularly concerning the threatenings contained in it. The persons entrusted with this task thought it best to lay the matter before Huldah, a prophetess, who lived in Jerusalem at the time, and pro-seeded to confer with her at her residence. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the Law in the house of the Lord.</span> There has been great difference of opinion as to what it was which Hilkiah had found. Ewald believes it to have been the Book of Deuteronomy, which had, he thinks, been composed some thirty or forty years before in Egypt by a Jewish exile, and had found its way, <span class="accented">by a sort of chance</span>, into Palestine, where "some <span class="accented">priest"</span> had placed a copy of it in the temple ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. pp. 233-235). Thenius suggests "a collection of the laws and ordinances of Moses, which was afterwards worked up into the Pentateuch;" Bertheau, "the three middle books of the Pentateuch, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers;" Gramberg, "Exodus by itself." But there seem to be no sufficient grounds for questioning the ancient opinion - that of Josephus, and of the Jews generally - that it was a copy of the entire Pentateuch. (So De Wette, 'Einleitung in das Alt. Test.,' &sect; 162 <span class="accented">a</span>; Keil, 'Commentary on Kings,' pp. 477, 478; Bahr, 'Commentary,' vol. 6. p. 257; and others). The words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "the <span class="accented">book</span> of the Law," are really sufficient to decide the point; since, as Keil says, they "cannot mean anything else, either grammatically or historically, than the Mosaic book of the Law (the Pentateuch), which is so designated, as is generally admitted, in the Chronicles and the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah." The same conclusion follows from the expression, "the book of the covenant" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5df;&#x5df;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>), in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>, and also from <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24, 25</a>, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>. Whether or no the copy was the actual original deposited in the ark of the covenant by Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), as Keil believes, is doubtful. As Egyptian manuscripts which are from three to four thousand years old still exist in good condition, there can be no reason why a manuscript of Moses' time should not have been found and have been legible in Josiah's. But, if not the actual handwriting of Moses, it was probably its lineal descendant - the copy made for the temple service, and kept ordinarily "in the side of the ark" - which may well have been lost in the time of Manasseh or Amen, and which was now happily "found." <span class="cmt_word">And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> We need not suppose that Shaphan read the whole. But he read enough to show him how important the work was, and how necessary it was to make it known to the king.

He is not officially learned in the Law. And he has only read a few passages of it. To him, therefore, it is only "a book," the authorship and value of which he leaves it to others to determine. <span class="cmt_word">And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> It is most natural to understand hero, as in ver. 8, that Shaphan read portions of the book.

It was not, however, a wholly new thing; rather, he accepted it as the recovery of a thing that was known to have been lost, and was now happily found. And in accepting it he regarded it as authoritative. It was not to him "a book of Law" (Ewald), but "the book of <span class="accented">the</span> Law." We can well imagine that, although the book may have been lost early in Manasseh's reign, yet echoes of it had lingered on <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the liturgies of the Jehovistic worship; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the teachings of the prophets; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in the traditional teaching of religious families; so that the pious ear recognized its phrases as familiar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is also probable that there were external tokens about the book indicative of its character, which caused its ready acceptance.

Huldah may thus have been the only possessor of the prophetic gift who was accessible. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe</span>; literally, <span class="accented">keeper of the garments</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>): In Chronicles the name of the keeper is given as "Hasrah." <span class="cmt_word">Now she dwelt at Jerusalem in the college</span> - rather, <span class="accented">in the lower city</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-10.htm">Zephaniah 1:10</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-9.htm">Nehemiah 11:9</a>; literally, in each place, "the <span class="accented">second</span> city ") - <span class="cmt_word">and they communed with her</span>; literally, <span class="accented">spoke with her</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.

The word of the Lord comes to Huldah with the arrival of the messengers, or perhaps previous to it, and she is at once ready with her reply. It divides itself into two parts. In vers. 15-17 the inquiry made is answered - answered affirmatively, "Yes, the fiat is gone forth; it is too late to avert the sentence; the anger of the Lord is kindled, and <span class="accented">shall not be quenched</span>." After this, in vers. 18-20, a special message is sent to the king, granting him an arrest of judgment, on account of his self-humiliation and abasement. "Because his heart was tender, and he had humbled himself before Jehovah, the evil should not happen in his day." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel.</span> Huldah is the only example of a prophetess in Israel, who seems to rank on the same footing with the prophets. Miriam (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="../../par/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>), Isaiah s wife (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and Anna (<a href="../../par/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) are called "prophetesses," but in a secondary sense, as holy women, having a certain gift of song or prediction from God. Huldah has the full prophetic afflatus, and delivers God's oracles, just as Isaiah and Jeremiah do. The case is a remarkable exception to the general rule that women should "keel) silence in the Churches." <span class="cmt_word">Tell the man that sent you to me.</span> The contrast between this unceremonious phrase and that used in ver. 18 is best explained by Thenius, who says, "In the first part Huldah has only the subject-matter in mind, while in ver. 18, in the quieter flow of her words, she takes notice of the state of mind of the particular person who sent to make the inquiry."

The passage which most strongly affected Josiah was probably that, already mentioned, in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which began with a series of curses.

God's threatenings against nations are for the most part conditional, and may be escaped, or at least their fulfillment may be deferred indefinitely, by repentance, as we learn from the example of Nineveh (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1-10</a>). But if a nation persists long in evil-doing, there comes a time when the sentence can be no longer averted. A real repentance has become impossible, and a mock one does but provoke God the more. For such a state of things there is "no remedy" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>), and this was the state of things reached by the Jews. God's anger against them could not be quenched.

Josiah had accompanied it by inward repentance and self-abasement. He had even been moved to tears (see the last clause but one of this verse). <span class="cmt_word">When thou heartiest what I spake against this place.</span> The book was, therefore, a record of what God had really spoken, not a fraud imposed on the king by the high priest, or on the high priest (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 235) by an unknown Egyptian exile. <span class="cmt_word">And against the inhabitants thereof</span>; that they should become a desolation and a curse. This is not a direct quotation from the Law, but a summary, in pregnant language, of the general effect of such passages as <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-35</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-20</a>.

But the contradiction is not a real one. Huldah was commissioned to assure Josiah that, though the destruction of his kingdom and the desolation of Judaea and Jerusalem, threatened in the Law, were at hand, yet they would not come in his day. He would not see the evil time. Before it came he would be "gathered to his fathers" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in Jerusalem, as his predecessors had been (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>), and not hurried off into captivity, to die in a foreign land, or given "the burial of an ass, drawn and east forth before the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). The promise given him was fulfilled. He died in battle; but he was buried in peace (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>); and the fated enemy who was to destroy Jerusalem, and carry the Jewish nation into captivity, did not make any attack upon the land until three years later, when he was departed to his rest, and the throne was occupied by Jehoiakim (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place</span>; e.g. the three sieges of Nebuchadnezzar, the destruction of the temple and city by Nebuzaradan (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>), the deportation of the bulk of the inhabitants (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and the calamities which happened to the remnant left (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a>).
