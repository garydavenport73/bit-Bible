<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - (Getup. these verses with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3-5</a>.)

Zedekiah will, it is true, be carried to Babylon, but he will not suffer a violent death; he will "die in peace," and be buried with all customary royal honours. A difficulty, however, has been felt in admitting this view. How could Zedekiah be said to die in peace, when he was "in prison till the day of his death" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>)? and how could the deposed king of a captive people be honoured with a public mourning? The reply is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, as compared with a cruel death by flaying or impalement, it was "peace" to live in the obscure quiet of a prison; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, as the Jews appear to have been left very much to themselves (see Ezekiel, <span class="accented">passim</span>), it is credible enough that they were allowed to show the customary honours to a deceased representative of David. At any rate, the alternative view seems not in accordance with sound exegesis, viz. that the verse means this, "If thou obey the word of the Lord, and surrender thyself to Nebuchadnezzar, thou shalt live and die in peaceable possession of the throne." What parallel can be produced for this violent interpretation? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a></div><div class="verse"><i>But</i> thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn <i>odours</i> for thee; and they will lament thee, <i>saying</i>, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With the burnings of thy fathers.</span> It was customary to burn spices at royal funerals (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-19.htm">2 Chronicles 21:19</a>). Saying, <span class="cmt_word">Ah lord!</span> (see on Jeremiah 22:18). The second of the group of prophecies in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34, 35</a>. is composed of vers. 8-22. It contains a denunciation of the Jews who, at the beginning of the siege, had emancipated their Hebrew slaves (according to <a href="../../par/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>), but after the withdrawal of the Chaldeans had resumed possession of them. Ver. 21 is couched in a form which indicates the precise date of the prophecy, viz. before the Chaldeans returned to renew the siege of Jerusalem.

Solemn agreements of this kind were not uncommon (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-12.htm">2 Chronicles 15:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">To proclaim liberty unto them.</span> The phrase, a very peculiar one, is taken from the law of jubilee (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), though the prescription on which the covenant was based refers exclusively to the seventh year of the slave's servitude.

The division of the calf might, in fact, be called in Hebrew either "the covenant" or "the token of the covenant" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10, 11</a>). It was a solemn assurance that he who should transgress God's Law should share the same fate as the victim. The same idea seems to have dictated the Hebrew phrase, "to <span class="accented">cut</span> a covenant," and the Greek and Latin equivalents (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">foedus icere</span>); comp. the parallel narrative in <a href="../../par/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10</a>.
