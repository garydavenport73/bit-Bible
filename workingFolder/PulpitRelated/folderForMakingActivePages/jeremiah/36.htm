Already mentioned as Jeremiah's attendant, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>. He appears to have been of high rank (see on ver. 15), as Josephus, indeed, expressly states ('Ant.,' 10:09, 1). Maaseiah, his grandfather, was governor of the city (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>), and Seraiah his brother (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>) held some equally honourable, though not so easily definable, position in the court. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-5.htm">Jeremiah 36:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I <i>am</i> shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - I am <span class="cmt_word">shut up.</span> Not so; Jeremiah was not detained by material force. Some strong reason he had (perhaps of a ceremonial kind), but as it was irrelevant to the narrative, it is not given. Render, <span class="accented">I am detained</span> (same verb as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-6.htm">Jeremiah 36:6</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the fasting day</span>. The mention of the fast day suggests that ver. 9 is out of its place, which again confirms the view that the narrative before us has received its present form from an editor. <span class="cmt_word">In the ears of all Judah</span> (see ver. 9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a></div><div class="verse">It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great <i>is</i> the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They will present their supplication;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their supplication will fall</span> (as margin). The phrase seems to be suggested by the gesture of a suppliant. Hence humility is one idea; but success is entirely another. That which lights down before one's eyes cannot be disregarded. Hence, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-20.htm">Jeremiah 37:20</a> and Jeremiah 42:2, the Authorized Version renders, "be accepted." This is,  at any rate, a better rendering than that quoted above, which is both weak in itself and obscures the connection. <span class="cmt_word">And will return;</span> rather, <span class="accented">so that they return.</span> "Returning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> repentance, is necessary, because their "evil ways" have provoked Jehovah to "great anger and fury;" but is only possible by the Divine help (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>, "To <span class="accented">give</span> repentance unto Israel"). Hence prayer is the first duty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-8.htm">Jeremiah 36:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, <i>that</i> they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the fifth year of Jehoiakim.</span> It is remarkable that the Septuagint has here the <span class="accented">eighth</span> year; and Josephus, too, relates that Jehoiakim paid tribute to Nebuchadnezzar in his eighth year. This latter statement seems to tally with the notices in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>. The vassalage of Jehoiakim is there said to have lasted three years; this followed the rebellion; while the siege of Jerusalem was reserved for the short reign of Jehoiachin. Now, as this siege must have been the punishment of Jehoiakim's rebellion, and as the reign of the latter king lasted eleven years, we are brought to the same date as that given by Josephus for the commencement of the vassalage, viz. the eighth year. It is to this year, then, that <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a> refers when it says, "In his days Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant;" and also the narrative before us in the statement that "they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem." What other event would have produced such a concourse of worshippers? The battle of Carchemish (which took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim)? But it was by no means clear as yet that the consequences of this would be disastrous for Judah. Carchemish was too far off for the people of Judah to show such serious alarm (similarly Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' etc., vol. 23. p. 300). If so, Jeremiah kept his prophecy by him for several years, till the fight moment came. <span class="cmt_word">The ninth month.</span> As this is a winter month (see ver. 22), Jeremiah evidently reckons by the Babylonian calendar, the ninth month of which, Kisiluv (Hebrew, Chisleu), began from the new moon of December. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chamber</span> (see on Jeremiah 35:4) <span class="cmt_word">of Genesisariah...the scribe.</span> Genesisariah was favourably disposed to Jeremiah (ver. 25); he was probably the brother of Jeremiah's friend, Ahikam (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>). He was one of the royal secretaries, and reckoned among the "princes" (see ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">In the higher court.</span> "Higher" equivalent to "inner." <span class="cmt_word">The new gate</span> (see on Jeremiah 20:2).

Jehudi is not a true proper name, any more than Gadi ("a Gadite"), the quasi-name of the father of Menahem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14</a>), or than Cushi, the quasi-name of Jehudi's great-grandfather. Cushi himself was, doubtless, an Ethiopian, and probably (like Ebed-melech, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>) a eunuch, or at least chamberlain; his son and grandson were both worshippers of Jehovah (as their names indicate), but were not qualified to become Jewish citizens. The Egyptian was not, indeed, to be abhorred, but not until the third generation could his descendants be admitted into" the congregation" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a>). Egypt and Ethiopia were historically connected (see Lenormant's 'Ancient History,' index to vol. 1.). For the name of "Jehudi," comp. "Jehudith," daughter of Beeri the Hittite (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>).

So Baruch read <i>it</i> in their ears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sit down now.</span> The princes evidently recognize Baruch as belonging to a family of distinction (see on ver. 4); and from vers. 19, 25 we may infer that they were favourably inclined beth to Baruch and to his master (comp. ch. 26.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-16.htm">Jeremiah 36:16</a></div><div class="verse">Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were afraid both one and other;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they turned shudderingly one to another.</span> Such an announcement as Jeremiah's at such a serious crisis startled them by its boldness.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-17.htm">Jeremiah 36:17</a></div><div class="verse">And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How didst thou write all these words at his mouth!</span> Two questions seem to be combined here - "How didst thou write all these words?" and "Didst thou write it all at his mouth?" Baruch's answer is good for both. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-18.htm">Jeremiah 36:18</a></div><div class="verse">Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote <i>them</i> with ink in the book.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He pronounced,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">He kept dictating</span>...  <span class="accented">while I wrote with ink</span>, etc. The addition of the last clause suggests (and was, perhaps, intended to do so) that Baruch's function was simply mechanical.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a></div><div class="verse">Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and <i>there was a fire</i> on the hearth burning before him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the winter house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that part of the royal palace (<span class="accented">beth</span>, house, may also be rendered <span class="accented">apartment</span>) which was arranged for a winter habitation (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). According to Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 309), the more airy part of a house is called "summerhouse," and the more sheltered room "winter house." The ninth month, in which the events now being related took place, corresponded approximately to our December. It was, therefore, the cold and rainy season; December is a stormy month in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">A fire on the hearth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the chafing dish</span> (or, <span class="accented">brazier</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast <i>it</i> into the fire that <i>was</i> on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that <i>was</i> on the hearth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three or four leaves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">columns</span> or <span class="accented">compartments</span>. "Leaves" would imply that it was a book out of which Jehudi read, Whereas it was a roll (<span class="accented">m'gillah</span> never has any other meaning). But "books" were not yet known, nor would a knife have been necessary to separate the pages. <span class="cmt_word">He cut it.</span> The subject may be either the king or Jehudi (at the bidding of the king). The term implies that the action of cutting was repeated several times; but we are not to suppose that each successive portion was cut off as it was read. The indignation of the hearer translated itself into the repeated mutilation of the roll, until all the roll was (east into the fire and) consumed. <span class="cmt_word">With the penknife</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with the scribe's knife. <span class="cmt_word"></span>On the hearth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the chafing dish</span> (or, <span class="accented">brazier</span>).
