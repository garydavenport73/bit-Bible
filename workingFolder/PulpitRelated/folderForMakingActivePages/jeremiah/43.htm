Jeremiah had called the whole people together (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-8.htm">Jeremiah 42:8</a>); but a few domineering men assumed to represent the rest.

It may be conjectured that Baruch had somehow made himself specially unpopular; he may have been a more practical man (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>) than Jeremiah.

Possibly there is some confusion in the text. "All nations" doubtless means especially Moab, Ammon, and Edom.

An Egyptian frontier city (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a> and note on Jeremiah 2:16), where the fugitives had to wait till the views of the Egyptian government respecting them were made known. The supposed site of the Pelusiac Daphnae has not yet been explored; a single inscribed fragment would reveal the Egyptian name, and probably ratify the identity of Daphnae with the Tahpanhes of the prophets (R.S. Poole, 'The Cities of Egypt,' p. 177). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</div><div class="comm">

"We must not suppose, arguing from our Western and precise notions, that he would be at all necessarily interfered with. In fact, he would have a twofold security, as a prophet of God to those who acknowledged him as such, and in the opinion of others as insane, and, according to Eastern ideas, thus especially under Divine promptings in his acts" (Streane). He is directed to take great stones and embed them in the mortar (not "clay") in the brick pavement at the entry of the palace. When the events predicted came to pass, these stones would testify that Jeremiah had predicted them. The word rendered "brick pavement" is of doubtful meaning. In <a href="../../par/nahum/3-14.htm">Nahum 3:14</a> it signifies "brick kiln." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a></div><div class="verse">And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And will set his throne,</span> etc.; viz. for the victorious king to hold judgment (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-38.htm">Jeremiah 49:38</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall spread his royal pavilion;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his tapestry</span> (the root means "brilliance"); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bright coloured covering of the throne. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a></div><div class="verse">And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, <i>and deliver</i> such <i>as are</i> for death to death; and such <i>as are</i> for captivity to captivity; and such <i>as are</i> for the sword to the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall smite the land of Egypt.</span> On the invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, wrongly controverted by some, see note on Jeremiah 46:13. <span class="cmt_word">Such</span> as are <span class="cmt_word">for death.</span> Such as are destined for death (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> pestilence, as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>). The words, "and deliver," prefixed in the Authorized Version, are unnecessary; "land" is equivalent to "population." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-12.htm">Jeremiah 43:12</a></div><div class="verse">And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Burn them;</span> viz. the temples. Egypt was full of gorgeous and imposing temples, which could not, however, always be burned, nor were the conquerors of Egypt anxious to display hostility to Egyptian religion. <span class="cmt_word">Carry them away captives;</span> viz. the idol gods (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, "Chemosh  shall no forth into captivity:" and <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-2.htm">Isaiah 46:2</a>, "Their soul [or, 'personality'] hath gone into captivity"). The prophet speaks from the point of view of a believer in the idol gods. <span class="cmt_word">He shall array himself with the land of Egypt,</span> etc. (For "array himself with" and "putteth on,"<span class="accented">read wrap himself in</span> and <span class="accented">wrappeth himself in.</span>) Ewald well explains this figure. "As easily as the shepherd in the open field wraps himself in the cool night in his mantle, will he be able to grasp Egypt with his hand and fling it round him like an easily managed garment, in order then to leave the land as an absolute conqueror, clothed in this attire of booty, in peace, without an enemy."

It was the custom to place obelisks in pairs at the entrance of their temples. Only one of those of Heliopolis is still standing, though that, indeed, is the oldest in Egypt, for it was "set up at least four thousand years ago" (R. S. Poole, 'The Cities of Egypt,' p. 131). That is in the land of Egypt. To distinguish it from the Beth-shemesh in Palestine. But we may also render "which are," etc.; comp. "the gods of Egypt" in the second verse half. The Septuagint reads, "which are in On." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/42.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 42"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 42" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/44.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 44"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 44" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
