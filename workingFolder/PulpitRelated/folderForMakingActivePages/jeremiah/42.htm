This petition has been accused of hypocrisy, but the prophecy of Jeremiah assumes throughout that it was made in earnest (ver. 20 proven nothing to the contrary). The "captains" never supposed it possible that Jeremiah could direct them to stay in Judah; the only question with them was as to the best direction for flight.

Keil thinks it was for the sake of the people, who needed time to collect themselves and listen calmly to the revelation. Ezekiel once waited seven days (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>); but this was owing to his own disturbed state of mind. The answer of the Lord extends to ver. 18, the last four verses being an epilogue enforcing the Divine declaration. It consists of the promise (vers. 9-12) that, if the people will remain quietly in the land, they will be protected; and of the threat (vers. 13-18) that, if they presume to migrate into Egypt, they will perish there by sword, famine, and pestilence.

The key to the discrepancy may be found in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25, 26</a>, "With the pious thou showest thyself pious... and with the froward thou showest thyself froward." There is no change in the nature or purpose of God, but only in his conduct towards man. The term "repent" is, therefore, only used analogically.

So the Syriac, the Vulgate, and Aquila.
