So St. Paul, "I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>, Revised Version); and Hosea has already drawn an awful picture of "Ephraim bringing forth his children to the murderer" (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a>). In ordinary times it was a kind of unwritten law among the Israelites to marry and beget children. Most of the prophets (e.g. Isaiah) appear to have been married. <span class="cmt_word">In this place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the land of Judah. A Jeremianic phrase (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>).

The absence of sepulture has already been pointed to several times as a feature of the horror of the times (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>), but this is a new and affecting touch. Dr. Payne Smith aptly refers to the plagues of Athens and London, in which the gentler elements of human nature were for the time almost extinguished. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, <i>even</i> lovingkindness and mercies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Compare this prohibition with that given to Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15-27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">The house of mourning</span>; literally, cf. <span class="accented">screaming</span> (an uncommon word, only occurring again - of banqueters - in <a href="../../par/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>). It is, no doubt, the wail of mourning relatives which is meant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall <i>men</i> lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald</span>. Both practices are forbidden in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>), but the prohibition was at any rate unknown to the masses (see, for the former, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; and for the latter, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>, "The Lord Jehovah called... to baldness;" <a href="../../par/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-18.htm">Ezekiel 7:18</a>). St. Jerome remarks, and incidentally gives a valuable evidence of the tenacity of primitive customs, "Mos hic fuit apud veteres, et usque hodie in quibusdam permanet Judaerum, ut in luctibus incidant lacertos," etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">Neither shall <i>men</i> tear <i>themselves</i> for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall <i>men</i> give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tear themselves for them</span>. The verb is used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> of breaking bread (the accusative is there expressed), and there is no doubt that this is the meaning here. The only question is whether <span class="accented">lahem</span>, for them, should not rather be <span class="accented">lekhem</span>, bread (this was read by the Septuagint, Peshito, Vulgate, Targnm). St. Jerome sees here an allusion to the funeral feasts (comp. the <span class="accented">parentalia</span>), and surely he is right. The Jews had a conception of the nature of the life of the other world only less distinct than that of their Egyptian neighbors. The funeral feast was not merely for the living, but for the dead. Indeed, it was primarily intended for the spiritual nourish-merit of those who had gone before to the unseen world (comp. Bonwick, 'Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought,' p. 48). Chardin, the old traveler, asserts that "the Oriental Christians still make banquets of this kind by a custom derived from the Jews." <span class="cmt_word">The cup of consolation</span>. It would seem as if the funeral feasts had dwindled among the Jews into little more than a refection for the benefit of the mourners.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-10.htm">Jeremiah 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what <i>is</i> our iniquity? or what <i>is</i> our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?</div><div class="comm">

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The text of these verses occurs in a more characteristic form and in a bettor connection in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7, 8</a>. The connection here would be improved by insorting the passage before Ver. 18; and as displacements are not unfamiliar phenomena in manuscripts, this would not be a violent act. The difficulty is not m the therefore introducing the promise, which frequently occurs in prophecies immediately after threatenings (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23, 24</a>), as if to say, "Things being in such a miserable plight, your God will interpose to help you;" but in the position of Ver. 18. How can the prophet say, "And <span class="accented">first I will recompense</span> their iniquity double," when Vers. 16, 17 contain a description of this very double recompense? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a></div><div class="verse">But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</div><div class="comm">

There may, perhaps, be an allusion to the cruel ancient practice of "sweeping the country with a drag-net" (Herod, 3:149), and then destroying the male population: Samos, e.g. was thus "netted" and depopulated by the Persians. Habakkuk may also refer to this when he says (Habakkuk 1:15), "They catch them in their net, and gather them in their <span class="accented">drag</span>."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-21.htm">Jeremiah 16:21</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name <i>is</i> The LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The final answer of Jehovah.
