But they are all deaf to the warning voice - the Law of God is flagrantly violated. In particular the marriage tie, as well the typical one between man and woman as the anti-typical between the people and its God, is openly disregarded (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye can find a man</span>. "A man" is explained by the following clauses. It is a man whose practice and whose aims are right, of whom Jeremiah, like Diogenes with his lantern, is in search.

Though they asseverate by the most solemn of all oaths (contrast <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1, 2</a>). Surely. So the Syriac. This rendering, however, involves an emendation of one letter in the text.

In fact, it was only after the return from Babylon that any popular schools were founded in Judaea, and not till shortly before the destruction of the temple that the elementary instruction attained the regularity of a system (Edersheim, 'Sketches of Jewish Social Life in the Time of Christ,' pp. 134, 135). <span class="cmt_word">The judgment of their God</span>. A similar phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>. "Judgment (<span class="accented">mishpat</span>) here (as in some other passages) has acquired a technical sense. This may be illustrated by the corresponding word in Arabic (<span class="accented">din</span>), which means <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> obedience, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a religion, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a statute or ordinance, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a system of usages, rites, and ceremonies" (Lane's 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.).

That the poet had Jeremiah in his mind cannot be doubted. The deep knowledge of the Scriptures possessed by medieval theologians (and such was Dante) may put many Protestants to shame. Curiously enough, whereas the early commentators on Dante interpret these wild beasts of vices, the moderns find historical references to nations. On the other hand, while modern expositors explain Jeremiah's wild beasts as symbols of calamities, Rashi and St. Jerome understand them of the Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks. <span class="cmt_word">A lion out of the forest.</span> The first of a series of figures for the cruel invaders of Judah (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>). The frequent references (see also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a>) show how common the lion was in the hills and valleys of the land of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">A wolf of the evenings</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a wolf which goes out to seek for prey in the evening. So the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate (comp. "wolves of the evening," <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>). But there is no evidence that '<span class="accented">erebh</span>, evening, has for its plural '<span class="accented">arabhoth</span>, which is, in fact, the regular plural of <span class="accented">arabah</span>, <span class="accented">desert</span>. Render, therefore, <span class="accented">a wolf of the deserts</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. one which has its den in the deserts, and falls upon the cultivated parts when it is hungry. Luther, "the wolf out of the desert." A leopard; rather, <span class="accented">a panther</span>. The Chaldeans are compared to this animal, on account of its swiftness, in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by <i>them that are</i> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How... for this?</span> rather, Why <span class="accented">should I pardon thee? <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy children</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. (since "the daughter of Zion" is equivalent to Zion regarded as an ideal entity) the members of the Jewish people (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, "the children of thy people"). <span class="cmt_word">When I had fed them to the full.</span> So Ewald, following the versions and many manuscripts (there is no marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible). This gives a good sense, and may be supported by ver. 28; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>. But the reading of the received Hebrew text, though somewhat more difficult, is yet perfectly capable of explanation; and, slight as the difference is in the reading adopted by Ewald (it involves a mere shade of pronunciation), it is not to be preferred to the received reading. Read, therefore, <span class="accented">though -r made them to swear</span> (<span class="accented">allegiance</span>),<span class="accented">!let they committed adultery</span>. The oath may be that of Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>.), or such au oath as had been recently taken by Josiah and the people (1 Kings 23:3; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-31.htm">2 Chronicles 34:31, 32</a>). The "adultery" may be taken both in a literal and in a figurative sense, and so also the "harlots' houses" in the next clause. It is also well worthy of consideration whether the prophet may not be referring to certain matrimonial customs handed down from remote antiquity and arising from the ancient system of kinship through women (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">They were <i>as</i> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As fed horses in the morning</span>. The rendering fed horses has considerable authority. "Lustful horses" is also possible; this represents the reading of the Hebrew margin. The following word in the Hebrew is extremely difficult. "In the morning" cannot be right, as it is against grammar; but it is not easy to furnish a substitute. Most moderns render "roving about;" Furst prefers "stallions."

There is a doubt about "walls," which should, as some think, rather be <span class="accented">vine-rows</span> (a change of points is involved; also of shin into sin - the slightest of all changes), or shoots, or branches (comparing the Syriac). The figure would thus gain somewhat in symmetry. However, all the ancient interpreters (whose authority, overrated by some, still counts for something) explain the word as in the Authorized Version, and, as Graf remarks, in order to destroy the vines, it' would be necessary to climb up upon the walls of the vineyard. (For the figure of the vine or the vineyard, scrap, on Jeremiah 2:21.) <span class="cmt_word">Take away... not the Lord's</span>. The Septuagint and Peshito read differently, translating "leave her foundations, for they are the <span class="accented">Lord's"</span> (supposing the figure be taken from a building). As the text stands, it is better to change <span class="cmt_word">battlements</span> into <span class="accented">tendrils</span>. Judah's degenerate members are to be removed, but the vine-stock, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>., the behooving kernel of the nation, is to be left. It is the key-note of the "remnant" which Jeremiah again strikes (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>).

The pointed text must be rendered, <span class="accented">he who speaketh</span> (<span class="accented">through the prophets</span>, viz. Jehovah) <span class="accented">is not in them</span>. Thus the Jews hurl against prophets like Jeremiah the very charge which Jeremiah himself brings against the "false prophets" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25-32</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Thus shall it be done</span>; rather, so <span class="accented">be it done</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. may the sword and famine, with which they threaten us, fall upon them.

The Authorized Version certainly gives apart of the meaning. The Hebrew word rendered "mighty" ('<span class="accented">ethan</span>), rather, "perennial," is the epithet of rocks and mountains (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>); of a pasture (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>); of rivers (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a>). As applied in the present instance, it seems to describe the inexhaustible resources of a young nation. Render here, <span class="accented">ever replenished</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. ever drawing anew from its central fountain of strength. Does not this aptly convey the impression which a long-civilized nation (and the Jews, who have been called "rude," were only so by comparison with the Egyptians and Assyrians) must derive from the tumultuous incursions of nomad hosts? The description-will therefore fit the Scythians; but it is not inappropriate to the Chaldeans, if we take into account the composite nature of their armies. <span class="cmt_word">An ancient nation</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">one</span> which still occupies its primeval seat in the north (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>), undisturbed by invaders. <span class="cmt_word">Whose language thou knowest not.</span> So Isaiah of the Assyrians, "(a people) of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand." The Jews were no philologists, and were as unlikely to notice the fundamental affinity of Hebrew and Assyrian as an ancient Greek to observe the connection between his own language and the Persian. When the combatants were to each other <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, mercy could hardly be expected.

Dr. Robinson remarks that there are not at the present day in Palestine "any particular periods of rain, or succession of showers, which might be regarded as distinct rainy seasons," and that...unless there has been some change m the climate of Palestine, the former and the latter rains seem to correspond to "the first showers of autumn, which revived the parched and thirsty earth and prepared it for the seed, and the later showers of spring, which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and the vernal products of the fields" ('Biblical Researches,' 3:98). <span class="cmt_word">He reserveth unto us</span>, etc.; literally, he <span class="accented">keepeth for us the weeks - the statutes of harvest</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the weeks which are the appointed conditions of harvest. The prophet means the seven weeks which elapsed from the second day of the Passover to the "Feast of Harvest," or "Feast of Weeks" (Pentecost) (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9, 10</a>).

"These things" are the benefits mentioned in the preceding verse (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-4.htm">Jeremiah 12:4</a>). Thus the judgment is not entirely future; a foretaste of it has already been given (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4.htm">Amos 4</a>.).

The Hebrew word <span class="accented">klub</span> is used in <a href="../../par/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a> for a basket such as was used for fruit; it seems to be the parent of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, used in the 'Anthology' for a bird-cage. The root means to plait or braid; hence some sort of basket-work seems to be meant. Connecting this with the preceding verse, Hitzig seems right in inferring that the "cage" was at the same time a trap (comp. Ecclus. 11:30, "Like as a partridge taken <span class="accented">in a cage</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, a peculiar kind of basket], so is the heart of the proud"). Canon Tristram suggests that there is an allusion to decoy-birds, which are still much employed in Syria, and are carefully trained for their office ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 163), But this seems to go beyond the text. <span class="cmt_word">Deceit</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the goods obtained by deceit.

The word rendered "appalling" (or stupefying) has a peculiar force, it only occurs again in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>, though a cognate adjective is found in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13</a> (comp. on Jeremiah 2:11).
