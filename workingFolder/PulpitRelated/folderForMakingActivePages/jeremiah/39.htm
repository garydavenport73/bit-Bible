The fact mentioned in this verse is not recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>; ch. 52; and its preciseness is a considerable pledge of its accuracy. The princes are four in number, and two of them have official titles attached. <span class="cmt_word">Nergal-sharezer</span> is the Hebraized form of Nirgal-sarra-ucur, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Nirgal (or Nergal), protect (or perhaps, has created) the king" - the name, as often, is a prayer. <span class="cmt_word">Samgar-nebo</span> is probably a modification of Sumgir-nabu, "Be gracious, Nebo;" but it has not yet been found in the inscriptions. <span class="cmt_word">Sarsechim</span> has the appearance of being corrupt; the first part, however, may, perhaps, be the Babylonian for "king" ("prince" in Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">Rab-saris</span> has a meaning in Hebrew - "chief of the eunuchs;" but the analogies of "Rab-mag" and "Rab-shakeh" suggest that it is merely the Hebraized form of some Assyrian title. In any case, it would be better to render "the Rab-saris," and to attach it closely to the preceding name, Sarsechim being himself the official called Rab-saris (see, however, ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Rab-mag.</span> This was "one of the highest titles in the state" (G. Smith). The etymology of the latter half of the phrase is uncertain; for the connection of "mag" with "Magi" is a mistake which has been exposed by Dr. Schrader, in his work, 'Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament' (of which a translation is announced). The native form of the name may be <span class="accented">rubu emga</span> (Schrader) or <span class="accented">rubu makhe</span> (Friedr. Delitzsch), and the whole title will mean "high priest" or "chief of the sorcerers" (comp. Delitzsch, "The Hebrew Language viewed in the Light of Assyrian Research," Lond., 1883, p. 14). "The Rab-mag" would be more accurate, and the title ought to be attached to the preceding name, Nergal-sharezer. As a matter of fact, a Nirgal-sarra-ucur, who held the office of <span class="accented">rubu emga, is</span> mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions, and we may plausibly conjecture that he is the person here mentioned among the "princes." He was afterwards raised to the throne by the conspirators who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar (he is better known as Neriglissar). It is singular that two Nergal-sharezers should be here mentioned; possibly the first mention is due to a mistake. The names are hardly recognizable in the Septuagint. The "princes" took up their station <span class="cmt_word">in the middle gate.</span> The "breach" spoken of in ver. 2 enabled the Babylonians to occupy the whole of the lower city to the northeast of Zion. The "middle gate" probably separated these two parts of Jerusalem, and  those who were posted there commanded the temple and the citadel.

The name occurs in a list of proper names, under the form <span class="accented">Nabu-sizibanni</span>, "Nebo, rescue me!" It is remarkable that a different name is given to the Rab-saris in ver. 3; and the conjecture is not unreasonable that Sarsechim is a corruption of the latter part of the name Nebushasban. In ver. 3 the Septuagint has <span class="accented">Nabu</span>sachar instead of Sarsechim (other copies read Nabusarsechim).

This statement conflicts (see introduction) with that in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1-5</a>, but only as to the time when Jeremiah was liberated.
