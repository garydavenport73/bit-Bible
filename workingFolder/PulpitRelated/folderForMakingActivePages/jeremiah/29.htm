Some eminent critics maintain that vers. 16-20 are an interpolation, and this view is certainly supported By the omission of these verses in the Septuagint. It must also in fairness be admitted that the natural connection of ver. 15 is with ver. 21, not with ver. 16. But it does not follow that vers. 16-20 are an arbitrary interpolation. They may be regarded either as a digression in the original letter, or as inserted by an after-thought when the substance of the letter was brought into its present form.

The name is into-resting; it shows that this prophet belonged to a family which took pleasure in the thought of Jehovah and his righteousness. Doubtless, too, he did so himself; but he under-estimated the demands of that righteousness, which extended to the heart as well as to the outward conduct.

"Casting into the midst of a burning fiery furnace" was a common punishment both among the Assyrians and the Babylonians, see e.g. ' Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 56; and comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a></div><div class="verse">Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and <i>am</i> a witness, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - An important and melancholy addition to our knowledge of these false prophets.

The phrase "to commit folly in Israel" is always (except <a href="../../par/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>) used of sins of unchastity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-24.htm">Jeremiah 29:24</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Thus</i> shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-32.</span> - A threatening oracle against the false prophet Shemaiah. Great excitement had been caused among the so-called prophets in Babylon by the emphatic language of Jeremiah. Accordingly one of them, named Shemaiah, wrote letters to the Jews at home, and especially to a high official called Zephaniah (see on ver. 26) to put a stop to Jeremiah's bold agitation. Zephaniah, however, was not the man for whom Shemaiah took him, and read the letter to the intended victim. Upon this, Jeremiah received a special revelation, announcing dire punishment to Shemaiah and his family (according to the principle of the Divine government described in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Shemaiah</span>; or, <span class="accented">of</span>, <span class="accented">concerning</span> (as the same preposition is rendered in vers. 16, 21, 31). The oracle itself speaks of Shemaiah in the third person (vers. 31, 32). The Authorized Version, however, can be defended by its accordance with ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">The Nehelamite</span>. This is evidently a patronymic, but whether of the family or the locality of the bearer cannot be decided. The analogy of "Jeremiah of Anathoth" (ver. 27), however, favors the view that it is local. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a></div><div class="verse">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that <i>are</i> at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man <i>that is</i> mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the stead of Jehoiada the priest</span>. Some (Grotius, Hitzig, Graf) think that this Jehoiada was the famous high priest of that name, who is said to have "appointed <span class="accented">officers</span> over the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18</a>). It is true that Zephaniah was not literally the successor of Jehoiada, but he was so in the same metaphorical sense in which the scribes are said by our Lord to "sit in Moses' seat" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2</a>). It is safer, however, to suppose that another Jehoiada is meant, of whom we have no further information. It is not said that either Jehoiada or Zephaniah was high priest, and as the special object of the elevation of the latter is said to be the supervision of the temple police, it is more probable that Jehoiada and he were successively "second priests," or, to use a phrase which seems to be synonymous, "deputy governors in the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>). The passage may thus without violence be harmonized with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, where Seraiah is called "the chief priest" and Zephaniah "the second priest." It is possible that Jehoiada 'had been favorable to the better class of prophets. In this case there will be a delicate hint to Zephaniah that God had his own purpose in promoting him to honor, viz. that unruly prophets like Jeremiah might be held in with a tighter hand (Ewald). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should be officers</span>; rather, that <span class="accented">there should be officers</span>. Zephaniah himself was an "officer" or "deputy" (see above); but he was also "chief in the house of the Lord," and had the appointment of inferior "officers," whose duty it was to preserve order in the temple. To understand the following words, we must remember that the outer court of the temple was a favorite place for prophetic teaching (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to keep an eye upon "madmen" and prophetizers. The term "mad" is used in a disparaging sense (as <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>), with regard to the apparently senseless behavior of those who were overpowered by the spirit of prophecy. In earlier times, no doubt, the phenomena of prophecy were more violently opposed to everyday life than in Jeremiah's time; but such symbolic acts as appearing in public with a yoke upon his neck would at least excuse the application of the epithet even to Jeremiah. It is more than probable, however, that it was not so much the abnormal actions as the contents of Jeremiah's prophecies which stirred up such vehement opposition; observe how in the next verse only the sound of these descriptive nouns is retained ("which maketh himself a prophet"). It was the making prophecy a reality which disturbed the men of routine, and Shemaiah well knew this when he made this appeal to Zephaniah. There was no harm in being nominally a "prophet," but to "make," or rather, "show one's self as a prophet," to be an energetic prophet, a prophetizer (if the word may be invented), - this was wormwood to those who cried, "Peace, peace," when there was no peace. <span class="cmt_word">In prison, and in the stocks</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the stocks</span> (see on Jeremiah 20:2) <span class="accented">and in the collar</span>. The meaning seems to be that Jeremiah was subjected to both forms of punishment at once.
