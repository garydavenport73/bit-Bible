A different Pashur from the one mentioned in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>. This one reappears in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>; he belonged to the fifteenth of the sacerdotal families, named after Melchiah (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Zephaniah</span>, mentioned again in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>.

This form predominates in Jeremiah and Daniel, and is the only form found in Ezekiel.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a></div><div class="verse">O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver <i>him that is</i> spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench <i>it</i>, because of the evil of your doings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O house of David</span>. The "house of David" here, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-13.htm">Isaiah 7:13</a>, means the various branches of the royal family, the same, in fact, which are called by courtesy "kings of Judah" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-20.htm">Jeremiah 17:20</a> (see note). They appear from the present passage to have monopolized the judicial function. <span class="cmt_word">Deliver him that is spoiled</span>, etc. The poor man would have no advocate to plead for him; in this case the judge was to see that he suffered no injustice in consequence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, <i>and</i> rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Jehovah, standing, as it were, on the Mount of Olives, addresses the proud city beneath him. <span class="cmt_word">O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">O inhabitress</span>; Jerusalem is personified as a virgin. The poetical description of the capital as a "valley" (the word, however, signifies a valley as wide as a plain) reminds us of "the valley [or rather, 'ravine'] of vision" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1, 5</a>); While "the rock of the plain" recalls "my mountain in the field" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>). So, as Graf points out, Babylon is called "a mountain" in metaphorical language (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>). It is, however, singular that the prophet should call Jerusalem a "valley" and a "rock" in the same passage. In the former, perhaps, Jeremiah is thinking specially of the lower city, and in the latter of Mount Zion. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall come down against us</span>? viz. from the "hills round about Jerusalem."
