The siege of Jerusalem had Begun in the preceding year (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>), but had been temporarily raised on the approach of an Egyptian army (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5, 11</a>). Jeremiah, who had declared resistance hopeless, had been accused of treason, and imprisoned (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>), and in prison he remained till the close of the siege. Like St. Paul at Rome, however, he was allowed free communication with visitors, as appears from ver. 8 and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>. Vers. 2-5 are parenthetical (see on ver. 6).

There was no object to gain by extending the scope of the revelation beyond the immediate present, and Zedekiah's offences did not require such an anticipative punishment as the clear prediction of the details of his fate (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>).

Ver. 6 resumes ver. 1, after the long parenthesis in vers. 2-5. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that <i>is</i> in Anathoth: for the right of redemption <i>is</i> thine to buy <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hanameel</span>.

In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a> the Authorized Version has <span class="accented">Hananeel</span>, and the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span> (of course, the persons referred to are different). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Shallum thine uncle.</span> It is strange that Hanameel should be called at once Jeremiah's uncle's son and his uncle; and yet this is the case - the former in vers. 8, 9, the latter in ver. 12. There is, therefore, no reason why we should deviate (as most commentators do) from the ordinary Hebrew usage, and suppose "thine uncle" in this verse to refer to Shallum, and not rather to Hanameel. But how are we to explain this singular variation in phraseology? Either from the fact that the Hebrew for "uncle" is simply a word expressive of affection (it means "beloved," see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>), and might, therefore, just as well be applied to a cousin as to an uncle: or else. upon the supposition that the word for "son (of)" has fallen out of the text before "mine uncle," both in this verse and in ver. 12. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-8.htm">Jeremiah 32:8</a></div><div class="verse">So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that <i>is</i> in Anathoth, which <i>is</i> in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance <i>is</i> thine, and the redemption <i>is</i> thine; buy <i>it</i> for thyself. Then I knew that this <i>was</i> the word of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The right of inheritance</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">of taking</span> <span class="accented">possession</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is thine.</span> The right, however, was dependent on the previous right of redeeming the land. Hence the speaker continues: <span class="cmt_word">The redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.</span> The Law directs, "If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). Jeremiah's kinsman, however, ascribes to him the right of pre-emption. This is not mentioned in Leviticus; hut, of course, no one would care to purchase a property till he was sure that the next kinsman would not insist on redeeming it. No one, it may be remarked, could purchase land unconditionally - the usufruct of it till the year of jubilee was all that was legally transferable; and even the original occupant had only a life interest in his land, the ownership of which was, strictly speaking, vested in the commune. This seems to Be the necessary inference from a comprehensive view of the passages relative to land in the Old Testament (see Mr. Fenton's 'Early Hebrew Life; ' and an article in the <span class="accented">Church Quarterly Review</span>, July, 1880). <span class="cmt_word">Then I knew,</span> etc. We may, perhaps, interpret this notice combined with that in ver. 6 thus: Jeremiah had had a presentiment, founded, perhaps, upon the distress to which his cousin had been reduced, that the latter would invite him to carry out the provisions of the Law; and his presentiments were generally so ordered by the Divine Spirit of prophecy as to be ratified by the event. Still, he had a measure of uncertainty till Hanameel actually came to him, and so demonstrated "that this had been the word of the Lord." In recording the circumstances, he not unnaturally reflects his later feeling of certitude in his description of the presentiment.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Jeremiah 32:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that <i>was</i> in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, <i>even</i> seventeen shekels of silver.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Seventeen shekels of silver; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about &pound;2 5<span class="accented">s</span>. 4<span class="accented">d</span>. (taking the shekel at 2<span class="accented">s</span>. 8<span class="accented">d.</span>). This has been thought a small price. Thirty shekels were paid for the potter's field (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-7.htm">Matthew 27:7</a>); fifty by David, for Araunah's threshing floor and oxen (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4</a>). The Hebrew has "seven shekels and ten of silver;" hence the Targum increases the price by supplying "minas" before "of silver," bringing up the sum to one hundred and seven shekels. This, however, seems too much. Even if Jeremiah wished to be liberal, he would hardly have been able to go so far (probably) in excess of the market price. Who would have purchased the land on speculation, if Jeremiah had refused? The famine made life, the siege, a continuance of personal liberty, terribly uncertain. And, putting this out of the question, there may have been but a short time to elapse before the year of jubilee, when the land would revert to its original occupant (see above). The singular form of expression in the Hebrew, at which the Targum stumbled, may, perhaps, be the usual style of legal documents. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-10.htm">Jeremiah 32:10</a></div><div class="verse">And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed <i>it</i>, and took witnesses, and weighed <i>him</i> the money in the balances.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - The Authorized Version is here so far wrong, on technical terms, that it seems best to retranslate the whole passage: "And I wrote (the circumstances) in the deed, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance. And I took the purchase deed, that which was sealed (containing the offer and the conditions), and that which was open; and I gave the purchase deed unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah (rather, Makhseiah), in the sight of Hanameel my uncle, and in the sight of the witnesses who subscribed the purchase deed, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. And I charged Baruch before them, saying, Thus saith Jehovah Sabaoth, the God of Israel, Take these deeds, this sealed purchase deed, and this open deed; and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days." The deed was made in two copies, so that if the open one were lost, or suspected of having been tampered with, an appeal might always be made to the sealed copy. The latter was to be placed in an earthen vessel, to preserve it from injury by damp. It ought to be added that the words in ver. 11, rendered "containing the offer and the conditions," are difficult. "Containing" is not expressed in the Hebrew, and "offer" is not the ordinary meaning, though etymologically justifiable.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</div><div class="comm">

This reminds us of a phrase in the exhortation in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>, as the next clause does of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a></div><div class="verse">And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An everlasting covenant.</span> It is the "new covenant" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, etc., which is meant (for the phrase, comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I will not turn...  to do them good.</span> The comma in the Authorized Version impairs the sense. The prophet means, "That I will not cease to show them favour" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Assuredly</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with faith. fulness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with perfect sincerity, without an <span class="accented">arriere pensee</span>, as the next words explain it; comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a> (Graf). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-42.htm">Jeremiah 32:42</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like as I have brought,</span> etc. The prophet still has in his mind the thought expressed in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>, that the brighter part of his revelations must as surely be accomplished as the darker. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-43.htm">Jeremiah 32:43</a></div><div class="verse">And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, <i>It is</i> desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fields</span>; rather, <span class="accented">land</span>; the Hebrew has "the field," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the open country (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-17.htm">Jeremiah 4:17</a>, etc.). We must then continue "in this country," and in ver. 44, "men shall buy lands." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a></div><div class="verse">Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal <i>them</i>, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Subscribe evidences;</span> rather, <span class="accented">write</span> (particulars of their purchase)in <span class="accented">the deed</span> (as ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Benjamin,</span> etc. The catalogue of the districts of the Jewish kingdom heightens the realistic effect (see on Jeremiah 17:26). Everywhere the old social system will be reproduced in its entirety. The land of Benjamin is mentioned first, on account of the property of Jeremiah at Anathoth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 33"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
