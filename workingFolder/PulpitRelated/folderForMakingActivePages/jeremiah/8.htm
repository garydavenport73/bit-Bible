Not only shall many of the dead bodies remain unburied, but the sepulchers of those who have till now "lain in honor, each one in his house" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18</a>), shall be violated. <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Jerusalem</span> meant are evidently those of the upper class, for the others were buried, with but little regard to the security of the corpses, in the valley of Kedron (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>). According to some, the motive of this invasion of the chambers of the dead is avarice (comp. Herod., 1:187, Darius at the tomb of Nitocris); but the context, without excluding this view, rather suggests malice and contempt. Thus "the wrath of man" was to "praise" Jehovah (<a href="../../par/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>).

The words are certainly to be omitted in the second place where they occur. In the Hebrew they stand after <span class="cmt_word">in all the places</span>, and the word for "places" is feminine, whereas the participle, "the remaining," is masculine. The Septuagint and Peshito have nothing corresponding. There is a clerical error in the Hebrew.

The section is introduced by a formula which connects it with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2, 28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall they fall</span>, etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Do men fall</span>...  <span class="accented">doth a man turn away?</span> One of those appeals to common sense in which the prophets delight. Who ever sees a fallen man stay quietly on the ground without attempting to rise? or a man who has wandered out of the path persist in going in the wrong direction? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">Why <i>then</i> is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slidden back</span>...  <span class="cmt_word">backsliding</span>. The verb is the same verb (in another conjugation) as in Ver. 4, and the noun is a derivative from it. The Authorized Version, therefore, has slightly weakened the force of the argument. <span class="cmt_word">They hold fast deceit</span>. They cling to a false view of their relation to their God (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">I hearkened and heard, <i>but</i> they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I hearkened and heard</span>. The Divine Judge condescends to speak after the manner of men. He will be his own witness; for it is his own people, Jeshurun, which is on its trial. <span class="cmt_word">Not aright</span>. It is a compound expression, equivalent to "insincerely," "untruly" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Repented...  turned</span>; rather, <span class="accented">repenteth</span>... <span class="accented">turneth</span> (or, <span class="accented">returneth</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>To his course</span>. The Hebrew text, sometimes represented as having a different reading ("courses," in the plural) from the margin, really gives the same reading with one letter misplaced. The singular stands in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19</a>, and offers no difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">As the horse rusheth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">over-floweth</span>. Both the Authorized Version and the Vulgate (<span class="accented">impetu vadens</span>) efface the second metaphor. The uncontrollable passion of both people and war-horse is compared to the all-subduing course of a winter stream or torrent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The appeal to the regularity of animal instincts reminds us of <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>. Yea, the stork, etc. The minatory birds obey their instinct with the most unfailing regularity. Those referred to are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the stork, whose "regular and sudden return is one of the most interesting natural sights of Palestine. The expression 'stork in the heavens' refers to the immense height at which they fly during migration" (Tristram); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the turtle, or turtle-dove, whose return is the sure sign of spring (<a href="../../par/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3 and 4)</span> the crane and the swallow, or rather, "the swift and the crane." These birds are again mentioned together in <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> (the psalm of Hezekiah), where special reference is made to the penetrating quality of their note. "The whooping or trumpeting of the crane rings through the night air in spring, and the vast flocks which we noticed passing north near Beersheba were a wonderful sight." The introduction of the swallow in the Authorized Version is misleading, as that bird is not a regular migrant in Palestine. The note of the swift is a shrill scream. "No bird is more conspicuous by the suddenness of its return than the swift," is the remark of Canon Tristram, who saw large flocks passing northwards over Jerusalem, on the 12th of February ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 208). It is an interesting fact that the swift bears the same name (<span class="accented">sus</span>) in the vernacular Arabic as in the Hebrew of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">The judgment</span>; better, <span class="accented">the law</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">How do ye say, We <i>are</i> wise, and the law of the LORD <i>is</i> with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he <i>it</i>; the pen of the scribes <i>is</i> in vain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How do ye say, We are wise</span>? Jeremiah is evidently addressing the priests and the prophets, whom he so constantly described as among the chief causes of Judah's ruin (comp. Ver. 10; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-9.htm">Jeremiah 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>), and who, in Isaiah's day, regarded it as an unwarrantable assumption on the part of that prophet to pretend to instruct them in their duty (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The law of the Lord is with us</span>. "With us;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in our hands and mouths. (comp. Psalm 1:16). The word <span class="accented">torah</span>, commonly rendered" Law," is ambiguous, and a difference of opinion as to the meaning of this verse is inevitable. Some think these self-styled "wise" men reject Jeremiah's counsels on the ground that they already have the divinely given Law in a written form (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>), and that the Divine revelation is complete. Others that <span class="accented">torah</span> here, as often elsewhere in the prophets (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>), simply means "instruction," or "direction," and describes the authoritative counsel given orally by the priests (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>) and prophets to those who consulted them on points of ritual and practice respectively. The usage of Jeremiah himself favors the latter view (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; and especially Jeremiah 26:4, 5, where "to walk in my <span class="accented">Torah"</span> is parallel to "to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets." The context equally points in this direction. The most natural interpretation, then, is this: The opponents of Jeremiah bade him keep his exhortations to himself, seeing that they themselves were wise and the divinely appointed teachers of the people. To this Jeremiah replies, not (as the Authorized Version renders) <span class="cmt_word">Lo, certainly in vain made he it</span>, etc.; but, <span class="accented">Yea</span>, <span class="accented">behold I for a lie hath it wrought - the lying pen of the scribes</span> (so Authorized Version, margin). <span class="accented">Soferim</span> (scribes) is the term proper to all those who practiced the art of writing (<span class="accented">sefer</span>); it included, therefore, presumably at least, most, if not all, of the priests and prophets of whom Jeremiah speaks. There are indications enough that the Hebrew literature was not entirely confined to those whom we look up to as the inspired writers, and it is perfectly credible that the formalist priests and false prophets should have availed themselves of the pen as a means of giving greater currency to their teaching. Jeremiah warns his hearers to distrust a literature which is in the set-vice of false religious principles - a warning which prophets in the wider sense of the term ('The Liberty of Prophesyings') still have but too much occasion to repeat, tit is right, however, to mention another grammatically possible rendering, which is adopted by those who suppose <span class="accented">torah</span> in the preceding clause to mean the Mosaic Law: "Yea, behold, the lying pen of the scribes hath made (it) into a lie;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the professional interpreters of the Scriptures called scribes have, by their groundless comments and inferences, made the Scriptures (especially the noblest part, the Law) into a lie, so that it has ceased to represent the Divine will and teaching. The objections to this are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the necessity of supplying an object to the verb - the object would hardly have been omitted where its emission renders the meaning of the clause so doubtful; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that this view attributes to the word <span class="accented">soferim</span> a meaning which only became prevalent in the time of Ezra (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 11</a>).] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-9.htm">Jeremiah 8:9</a></div><div class="verse">The wise <i>men</i> are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom <i>is</i> in them?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wise men are ashamed</span>. It is the perfect of prophetic certitude, equivalent to "the wise men shall certainly be ashamed." And why? Evidently because they have not foreseen the calamities impending ever their nation. They have preached, "Peace, peace; when there was no peace" (Ver. 11); and hence they find themselves "taken" in the grip of a relentless power from which there is no escape. <span class="cmt_word">What wisdom</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wisdom of what? i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in respect of what?

They are omitted in the Septuagint, and Hitzig regards them as an interpolation, at any rate from the point where the present passage coincides verbally with its parallel. His grounds are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ver. 13 follows more naturally on Ver. 10 ("... them that shall inherit them") than on Ver. 12; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Ver. 10 is deficient in symmetry; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the deviations from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a> sometimes loosen the connection of the clauses, sometimes sink into the colloquial style. The arguments seem to be inconclusive. Jeremiah is apt to repeat himself (Graf refers to Ver. 14   =   <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; Ver. 15  - <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a>   =   5:29, 9:8; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>   =   11:14; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-41.htm">Jeremiah 50:41-43</a>   =   6:22-24; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:44 - 46   =   49:19-21); and the element which is common to this paragraph and to oh: 6:12-15 seems equally appropriate in both connections. It should be added, however, that the cautious and reverent block has come to the same conclusion as Hitzig. To them that shall inherit them; rather, <span class="accented">to them that shall take possession of them</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by violence.

It is the actual condition of things which the prophet describes. Elsewhere Judah is compared to a vine with bad grapes (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>); here the vine does not even pretend to bear fruit. Another figure is that of a barren fig tree (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the things that I have given them</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and I gave them that which they transgress</span> (viz. <span class="accented">laws</span>). The construction, however, which this rendering implies is not perfectly natural, though supported by most of the ancient versions (except the Septuagint, which omits the words), and it is better to alter a single vowel-point, and render "And I will give them to those who shall pass over them." The phrase to pass away is constantly used of an invading host; e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10, 40</a>.

It is a little difficult to find a rendering which shall suit all the passages in which <span class="accented">rosh</span> (gall) is mentioned. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a> (and so <a href="../../par/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>) it is clearly used for "venom" in general; and yet in Ver. 32 of the same chapter it obviously means a plant. Another general application of the term seems to have been to bitterness in general, the ideas of bitterness and poisonousness being taken as interchangeable. The Authorized Version may therefore stand.

Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, <i>and</i> with strange vanities?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because of them that dwell in</span>, etc. The Hebrew simply has "from them," etc. The prophet is transported in imam-nation to the time of the fulfillment of his prophecies. He hears the lamentation of his countrymen, who are languishing in captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the Lord in Zion</span>, etc.? is the burden of their sad complaints; "king" is a familiar synonym for "God" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>; but not <a href="../../par/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>, which is certainly mistranslated in Authorized Version). But why" in Zion?" "Zion" was properly the name of the eastward hill at Jerusalem, where lay the oldest part of the city (called "the city of David"), and the highest portion of which was crowned by the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Why have they provoked me to anger</span>, etc.? is the reply of Jehovah, pointing out that their sufferings were but an exact retribution for their infidelity (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-19.htm">Jeremiah 5:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-20.htm">Jeremiah 8:20</a></div><div class="verse">The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The harvest is past</span>, etc. For "summer," read <span class="accented">fruit-gathering</span> (the vintage began in September). The people again becomes the speaker. The form of the speech reminds one of a proverb. When the harvest was over and the fruit-gathering ended, the husbandmen looked for a quiet time of refreshment. Judah had had its "harvest-time" and then its "fruit-gathering;" its needs had been gradually, increasing, and, on the analogy of previous deliverances (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>), it might have been expected that God would have interposed, his help being only delayed in order to be the more signally supernatural. <span class="cmt_word">But we are not saved</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">delivered</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a></div><div class="verse">For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the hurt</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">because of the breaking</span>, etc., <span class="accented">I am broken</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>, and the phrase "broken in heart" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, etc.). The prophet feels crushed by the sense of the utter ruin of his people. <span class="cmt_word">I am black</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">go in</span> mourning (so <a href="../../par/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>). The root means rather "foulness" or "squalor" than "blackness" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>, where "blackish," an epithet of streams, should rather be "turbid"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is there</i> no balm in Gilead; <i>is there</i> no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - No hope or remedy is left; again a proverbial expression. <span class="cmt_word">No balm in Gilead</span>. Gilead appears to have been celebrated in early times for its balsam, which was expected by Ishmaelites to Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>) and by Jewish merchants to Tyro (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>). It was one of the most costly products of Palestine (<a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>), and was prized for its medicinal properties in cases of wounds (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a>). Josephus mentions this balsam several times, but states that it only grew at Jericho ('Antiq.,' 15:4,2), Tristram searched for balsam in its ancient haunts, but in vain; he thinks Jeremiah means the <span class="accented">Balsamodendron gileadense</span> or <span class="accented">opobalsamum</span>, which in Arabia is used as a medicine both internally and externally. But if Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 24:22) may be followed in his wide use of the term "balsam" so as to include the exudations of the "lentisens" or mastick tree, then "balm of Gilead" is still to be found; for the mastick tree "grows commonly all over the country, excepting in the plains and the Jordan valley" ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 336). <span class="cmt_word">Is there no physician there?</span> We hear but little of physicians in the Old Testament. They are only mentioned again in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> (but with reference to Egypt, where medicine was much cultivated), and in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>. From the two latter passages we may, perhaps, infer  that physicians were rarely successful; and this is certainly the impression produced by Ecclus. 38:15, "He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician." The remedies employed in the Talmudic period quite bear out this strong saying (see Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraical,' on <a href="../../par/mark/5-26.htm">Mark 5:26</a>). The physicians of Gilead, however, probably confined themselves to their one famous simple, the balsam. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the health...  recovered</span>?
