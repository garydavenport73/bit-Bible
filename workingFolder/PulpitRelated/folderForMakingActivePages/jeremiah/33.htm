Jehovah's great purpose is the regeneration of his people. To "frame" or "form" is synonomous with "purpose" (see on. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-11.htm">Jeremiah 38:11</a>). The meaning of the verse is that Jehovah's very Name is a pledge of his fidelity to his promises (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). To "establish" is synonymous with "to carry out."

It must be admitted that this introduction hardly corresponds to the sequel, which does not contain any special secrets, as we should have thought. Either vers. 2, 3 have been inserted by a later (inspired) editor, whose mind was absorbed in high thoughts of the latter days - for this view may be urged the style and phraseology, which are hardly those of the surrounding chapters, hardly those of Jeremiah; or else we must adopt Hengstenberg's perhaps over subtle suggestion, which, however, does not touch the question of the phraseology, "that throughout Scripture dead knowledge is not regarded as knowledge; that the hope of restoration had, in the natural man, in the prophet, as well as in all believers, an enemy who strove to darken and extinguish it; that therefore it was ever new," or, in the words of Jeremiah, "great and secret things, which thou knowest not." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - The houses of Jerusalem, destroyed by the engines of the besiegers or filled with dead bodies, shall be restored; the captives shall be brought back; their sins shall be forgiven, and God be glorified. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the mounts, and by the sword;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because of the mounds</span> (see on Jeremiah 32:24) <span class="accented">and because of the weapons of war.</span> The latter are the warlike instruments used by the besiegers from their batteries or breastworks.

"They come" could only refer to the Jews, but these would rather be said to "go out;" the Hebrew writers are particular in distinguishing between to "come" and to "go out." Besides, there is no grammatical connection with the preceding verse. The Septuagint omits "they come," but the passage still remains enigmatical. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will bring it health and cure,</span> etc. "Health" is properly the fresh skin which grows over a healing wound (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>).

In this case the figure will be that of a mighty stream (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Truth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">continuance</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>).

In particular it is urged that the promise of a multitude of Levites and of descendants of David is isolated among the prophecies of Jeremiah, who elsewhere speaks of a single great representative of David as the object of pious hope, and of the intercourse between Jehovah and his people as being closer and more immediate than under the old Law. A variation in the form of expressing the Messianic hope is, however, not of much importance. Isaiah, for instance, sometimes refers to a single ideal king (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, etc.); sometimes to a succession of noble, God-fearing kings (<a href="../../par/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That good thing which I have promised;</span> viz. in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a> (which see).

It agrees in form with the announcements in <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-18.htm">Jeremiah 33:18</a></div><div class="verse">Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the priests the Levites,</span> etc. It has Been thought that this passage is inconsistent with the prophecies of a time when the ark should no more be remembered (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>), and when all should know Jehovah from the least to the greatest (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>). But though sin offerings would in this glorious time become things of the past, yet thank offerings are expressly excepted from abolition (ver. 11), and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a> a special latter-day promise is given to the priests. Moreover, Ezekiel, who repeats the prophecy of the new spiritual covenant (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a>), gives an elaborate sketch of a new temple with a sacrificial system (ch. 40, etc.); and, if there is any inconsistency, we find the same one in the latter part of Isaiah. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a> the whole regenerate people of Israel is called "the priests of Jehovah;" but in <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-21.htm">Isaiah 66:21</a> the prophet distinctly states that there will be, in some sense, a priestly class within the chosen people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-19.htm">Jeremiah 33:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - The constant, regular succession of day and night is an emblem of the equally regular supply of royal descendants of David and of Levitical priests, and the countless grains of sand are symbolic of the wonderful increase of their numbers. At first sight the latter part of the promise seems a little unlike a blessing. But we have seen already (on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>) that the members of the various branches of the royal family probably occupied the principal offices of the state, and the prophet imagines the future in forms borrowed from the present. A numerous sacerdotal class seemed equally necessary for the due magnificence of the ritual; and we must remember that preternatural fertility of the soil was a standing element of Messianic descriptions. The expressions used are, no doubt, hyperbolical, but the meaning seems clear enough. (Hengstenberg's notion, that the prophet rather indicates the abolition of the royal and sacerdotal distinctions (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), is surely very far fetched.)
