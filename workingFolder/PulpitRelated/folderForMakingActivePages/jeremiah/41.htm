It seems strange, however, that the occurrences related in ch. 40. and 41. should have taken so short a time. Gratz calls in question the accuracy of the chronological statement. He quotes <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-24.htm">Ezekiel 33:24-29</a>, which shows that at least six months (according to his calculation) after the fall of Jerusalem Jewish fugitives still lingered on, and hoped to obtain possession of their fatherland, and points out that time was necessary for Gedaliah to erect a temple at Mizpah (see on ver. 5), for cities to arise out of their ruins, and for cultivation of the soil to be resumed (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>). Besides, according to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-30.htm">Jeremiah 52:30</a>, a third deportation of Jews is mentioned. How can this be accounted for, if, only two months after the fall of Jerusalem, the remnant of the Jewish population emigrated under Johanan ben Kareah to Egypt? Gratz shows reason for thinking that this last deportation stands in close connection with Gedaliah's death, and that consequently the interval between this latter event and the fall of Jerusalem lasted, not two months, but five years. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Elishama.</span> Perhaps the Elishama men. tioned in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> as a secretary of state; or perhaps a son of David of that name (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>; "son" being taken here in a wider sense). <span class="cmt_word">And the princes of the king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">one of</span>) <span class="accented">the princes of the king. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Even ten men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> ten men.

It was the day on which the hope of living a separate life in the promised land, for a time at least, vanished; and the murder was avenged by a new captivity (see above).

He could have had no personal motive; but his employer, Baalis, desired that "the remnant in Judah might perish" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-15.htm">Jeremiah 40:15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a></div><div class="verse">That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, <i>even</i> fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring <i>them</i> to the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There came certain from Shechem,</span> etc. A number of pious pilgrims, descend. ants of the old ten tribes, passed by on their way to the holy site of the temple at Jerusalem (?) (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From Shiloh.</span> The Vatican Codex of the Septuagint has a plausible reading, "from Salem," which is apparently  supported by <a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>, "And Jacob cares to Shalem, a city of Shechem," and by its improvement thus introduced into the geographical order (Shiloh is, in fact, nearer to Mizpah than Shechem, and ought to be mentioned first). But though there is now a village called Salim, to the east of Nablus (Shechem), we have no sufficient ground for assuming a city of that name in the Old Testament, The rendering of Genesis, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> needs correction ("came in peace to the city," etc.) <span class="cmt_word">Their beards shaven,</span> etc. They had, then, all the outward signs of mourning (for the public calamities); comp, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To bring</span> them <span class="cmt_word">to the house of the Lord.</span> Yet the temple at Jerusalem was destroyed. Hence Thenius and Gratz have conjectured that Gedaliah had erected a provisional temple at Mizpah, which was already hallowed by its association with the Prophet Samuel. This is confirmed by 1 Macc. 3:46, where it is said of the pious Jews in the Maccabean rising, that they "assembled themselves...  and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-6.htm">Jeremiah 41:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Weeping all along as he went.</span> To testify his sympathy with their grief. But the reading of the Septuagint is more natural, "As they were going along and weeping." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-7.htm">Jeremiah 41:7</a></div><div class="verse">And it was <i>so</i>, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, <i>and cast them</i> into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that <i>were</i> with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The pit</span> (see on ver. 9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-8.htm">Jeremiah 41:8</a></div><div class="verse">But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.

But the "ten men" do not, as the bishop supposes, beg their lives on the ground that they had not yet harvested, but rather offer a bribe. <span class="cmt_word">We have treasures</span> (literally, <span class="accented">hidden things</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in the field.</span> The allusion is to the "wells or cisterns for grain," in which "the farmers store their crops of all kinds after the grain is threshed and winnowed. These cisterns are cool, perfectly dry, and tight. The top is hermetically sealed with plaster, and covered with a deep bed of earth; and thus they keep out rats, mice, and even ants, the latter by no means a contemptible enemy .... These ten men had doubtless thus hid their treasures to avoid being plundered in that time of utter lawlessness" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 509). <span class="cmt_word">Honey</span>.

It would seem that this "pit" formed part of Asa's defensive works; probably it was a cistern to supply the town with water during the siege. <span class="cmt_word">Because of Gedaliah;</span> was it. The rendering "because of" must be abandoned. The Septuagint has, in this part of the verse, the very natural words, "was a great pit," and this reading is adopted by Movers, Hitzig, and Graft.
