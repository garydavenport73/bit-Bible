Righteous art thou, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">Righteous wouldest thou be</span>, <span class="accented">O Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">if I should plead with thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if I were to bring a charge against thee, I should be unable to convict thee of injustice (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>). The prophet, however, cannot refrain from laying before Jehovah a point which seems to him irreconcilable with the Divine righteousness. The rendering, indeed, must be modified. <span class="cmt_word">Let me talk with thee of thy judgments</span> should rather be, <span class="accented">yet will I debate questions of right with thee</span>. The questions remind us of those of Job in <a href="../../par/job/21.htm">Job 21, 24</a>. Thus to have been the recipient of special Divine revelations, and to be in close communion with God, gives no security against the occasional ingress of doubting thoughts and spiritual distress. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore are all they happy</span>, etc.? rather, secure. The statement must be qualified by what follows. In the general calamity the wicked still fare the best. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou <i>art</i> near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Far from their reins</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from their heart (the seat of strong impulses and desires); comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>.

The verse is decided rather differently by the Hebrew accents. The question should end at <span class="cmt_word">wither</span>, and the following words run on. <span class="cmt_word">Every field</span> should be <span class="accented">the whole field</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> open country). The connection has caused some difficulty. But drought is constantly described as a judgment (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2-7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>), and it is a prophetic doctrine that the lower animals suffer for the fault of man. <span class="cmt_word">Because they said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because they say</span>. The speakers are the ungodly. The subject of the following verb is uncertain. Some think it is God; but when God is said to "see" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> take notice of) anything, it is always something actually existing. The subject must, therefore, be the prophet, of whom the ungodly scoffingly declare, <span class="cmt_word">He shall not see our last end,</span> because his predictions are mere delusions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and <i>if</i> in the land of peace, <i>wherein</i> thou trustedst, <i>they wearied thee</i>, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Jeremiah's impatience corrected.

" Lions' bones have been found by Dr. Roth in the gravel of the Jordan. Lions are seldom or never found now west of the Euphrates, although they occasionally cross the river" (Revelation W. Houghton, 'Bible Educator,' 1:22). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-6.htm">Jeremiah 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - An example of the "treachery" referred to in Ver. 1; a conspiracy against Jeremiah in his own family. <span class="cmt_word">Have called a multitude after thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">have called aloud after thee</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> one raises a hue and cry after a thief. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-17.</span> - A separate prophecy. The key to it is in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1, 2</a>, where it is related that, after Jehoiakim's rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, "Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it." The prophecy falls into two strophes or sections, Vers. 7-13 and Vers. 14-17. In the first we have a complaint of the desolation produced by the guerilla warfare; in the second, a prediction of the captivity of the hostile peoples, not, however, without a prospect of their return home and conversion to Jehovah. It is evident enough that this passage stands in no connection with what precedes. The whole tone is that of a description of present scenes and not of the future. Sometimes, no doubt, a prophet, in the confidence of faith, represents the future as though it were already past; but there is always something in the context to determine the reference and prevent ambiguity. Here, however, there is nothing to indicate that the description relates to the future; and it is followed by a prediction which presupposes that the preceding passage refers to the literal past. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have forsaken mine house</span>. The "house" is here not the temple, but the people of Israel, as the parallel clause shows (see <a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>, and setup. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>). Jehovah, not the prophet, is evidently the speaker. <span class="cmt_word">I have left</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I have east away</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Into the hand of her enemies.</span> The Hebrew is more expressive: "Into the palm of the hand." Bonomi ('Nineveh and her Palaces,' p. 191) has an engraving from the monuments of guests at a banquet, holding their drinking-vessels in the deeply hollowed palm of their hand. So here the people of Israel, in her weak, fainting state, needs only to be held in the quiet pressure of the palm of the hand. The remark and the illustration are due to Dr. Payne Smith. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a></div><div class="verse">Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The reason why Jehovah has given up his people. Israel (or, more strictly, Judah) has proceeded to open hostility against his God<span class="cmt_word">. He is unto me</span> - or rather, <span class="accented">has become</span> unto me - <span class="cmt_word">as a lion in the forest</span>; a familiar circumstance (comp. on Ver. 5 and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore have I hated it</span>. "To hate" is a strong expression for the withdrawal of love, shown by the giving up of Israel into the power of his enemies, as <a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a> (Keil). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a></div><div class="verse">Mine heritage <i>is</i> unto me <i>as</i> a speckled bird, the birds round about <i>are</i> against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span>  - The first part of this verse is mistranslated. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">Mine heritage is unto me</span>, etc., it should be, <span class="accented">Is mine heritage unto</span> me (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to my sorrow, a <span class="accented">dativus ethics</span>) <span class="accented">a colored bird of prey? Are birds of prey round about her?</span> The passage is difficult, but the following seems the most plausible explanation: - Jehovah is represented as surprised to see his chosen people a prey to the heathen (a strongly anthropomorphic description, as if Jehovah had not anticipated that his "giving up" his people would have such sad results). It seems to him (adopting human modes of speech) as if Israel were "a colored bird of prey," the bright plumage of which excites the animosity of its less brilliant comrades, who gather round it and pull it to pieces. It is an allusion to the phenomenon, well-known to the ancients (Tacit., 'Ann.' 6:28; Suet., 'Caes.,' 81; Plin.,' Hist. Nat.,' 10:19), of birds gathering round and attacking a strange-looking bird appearing in their midst. The prophet might have simply said "a bird;" why does he say "a bird of prey ('<span class="accented">ayit</span>)"? Probably because he has just described the hostile attitude of Israel towards Jehovah under the figure of a lion. Some particular, rare kind of vulture seems to be intended. Sennacherib apparently uses a cognate word ('it) for the vulture ('Taylor Cylinder,' 3. 68). Bochart and Gesenius, following the Septuagint, think "hyena," and not "bird of prey," is the right rendering in the first clause; but Gesenius does not offer any other passage for the meaning <span class="accented">bestia</span> <span class="accented">rapax</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field</span>. There is a parallel passage in <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>, where, as here, the "beasts of the field (<span class="accented">i.e. the wild</span> beasts of the open country) are the heathen powers employed as God's instruments for chastising Israel (comp. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>, where the same figure occurs). "The prophet adopts the strongest way of expressing that Israel, utterly bereft of his natural defenders, lies at the mercy of the great heathen empire" (note on Isaiah 56:9). <span class="cmt_word">Come to devour</span>; rather, <span class="accented">bring them to devour</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Another simpler and more natural image, expressing the same idea, as these in Ver. 9. The favorite way of representing Jehovah's relation to his people is that of a vine-proprietor to his vineyard (see on Jeremiah 2:21). How would a vineyard be ruined if a band of shepherds were to drive their flocks among the tender vine-shoots! <span class="cmt_word">The many pastors</span> (or, <span class="accented">shepherds</span>) are clearly Nebuchadnezzar and his generals (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My pleasant portion</span>. Jehovah is the "portion" of his people; his people and its land are the "portion" of Jehovah (see on Jeremiah 10:16). The epithet "pleasant" expresses the emotion of the surprised speaker. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-11.htm">Jeremiah 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">They have made it desolate, <i>and being</i> desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth <i>it</i> to heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Layeth it to heart</span>; rather, <span class="accented">laid</span> it to heart. Inconsiderateness is repeatedly spoken of as an aggravation of the moral sickness of Israel (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1, 11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a></div><div class="verse">The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the <i>one</i> end of the land even to the <i>other</i> end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon an high places thresh the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon all bare heights in the wilderness</span> (see on Jeremiah 3:2). Hardly with a reference to their pollution by idolatry; the mention of "the wilderness" (or pasture-country) suggests that it is merely a feature in the impoverishment of the country (a contrast to <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-9.htm">Isaiah 49:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sword of the Lord shall devour</span>; rather, the Lord hath a <span class="accented">sword which devoureth</span>. It is the heavenly sword (<a href="../../par/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>), the symbol of Divine vengeance (see below on Jeremiah 46:5). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a></div><div class="verse">They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, <i>but</i> shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - A description in proverbial language of the absence of "peace" (literally, <span class="accented">soundness</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prosperity, security), from which "all flesh" in Judah at this time shall suffer. The trouble of sowing has been in vain, for <span class="accented">they have reaped thorns</span> (<span class="accented">so</span> we must render grammatically, <span class="cmt_word">and not shall reap</span>, and in the next clause <span class="cmt_word">shall not profit</span> ought to be <span class="accented">have not profited</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And they shall be ashamed of your revenues</span>; rather, be ashamed <span class="accented">then of your produce</span>; but it is more natural to emend the pronominal suffix, and render, <span class="accented">and are ashamed of their produce</span> (the Authorized Version seems to have very nearly taken this easy step). It is, of course, the produce of husbandry which is referred to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-14.htm">Jeremiah 12:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Here occurs a transition. The prophet comes forward with a denunciation in the name of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">All mine evil neighbors</span>; the hostile, peoples, mentioned, in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>. My neighbors, because Jehovah "dwelleth in Zion." <span class="cmt_word">Pluck them out of their land</span>; viz. by deportation into a foreign land. Judah and the neighboring nations shall share the same fate. This is indicated by the use of the same verb "to pluck out" in the next clause with reference to Judah (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-15.htm">1 Kings 14:15</a>, Hebrew). In the case of Judah, however, to be "plucked out" is a mercy as well as a judgment, considering who they are "out of" whose "midst" the Jews are "plucked." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-15.htm">Jeremiah 12:15</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will return, and have compassion</span>. The rendering is too Hebraistic; the sense is simply, <span class="accented">I will</span> <span class="accented">again have compassion</span>. The prophets offer no partial or "nationalistic" view; of the mercy of God (comp. on Jeremiah 48:47).
