<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou <i>art</i> Gilead unto me, <i>and</i> the head of Lebanon: <i>yet</i> surely I will make thee a wilderness, <i>and</i> cities <i>which</i> are not inhabited.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the king's house of Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">concerning the house of the King of Judah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the royal palace, which, on account of its height and its being constructed so largely out of cedar-weed (comp. vers. 14, 23), is called "Gilead, and the summit of Lebanon," just as Solomon's palace was called "the house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>). Of Gilead in general, Canon Tristram writes, "No one can fairly judge of Israel's heritage who has not seen the luxuriant exuberance of Gilead, as well as the bard rocks of Judaea." And again, "Lovely knolls and dells open out at every turn, gently rising to the wooded plateau above. Then we rise to higher ground and ride through noble forests of oak. Then for a mile or two through luxuriant green corn, or perhaps through a rich forest of scattered olive trees, left untended and uncared for, with perhaps patches of corn in the open glades" ('Bible Places,' p. 322). The cedars of Lebanon, however diminished, still bear witness to the ancient fame of this splendid mountain district. <span class="cmt_word">A wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited</span>. The comparison has a terrible significance when read in the light of De Vogue's and Freshfield's discoveries. For Gilead itself is full of ruined cities of massive stone architecture. "It is no uncommon thing," says Mr. F.A. Eaton, "to see these houses in a complete state of preservation, built of huge blocks of black basalt, with slabs of the same for the roof, twelve feet long, a foot and a half wide, and half a foot thick, and entrance doors also of basalt... great solid stones of the same material being used as lintels at the top and bottom" (Speech at the meeting for setting on foot the survey of Eastern Palestine, November 30, 1880: <span class="accented">Statement of Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, January, 1880, p. 11). <span class="accented">Cities which are not inhabited</span>; not, indeed, the cities of Gilead of the time of Jeremiah, but constructed of materials which may reasonably be presumed to have been chiseled in a far more remote antiquity. (The date of the cities in their present state is subsequent to the Christian era.)

The king referred to is probably Jehoahaz, who, though two years younger than Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; comp. 36), was preferred to him by the people on the death of Josiah. The counsel to "weep sore" for this royal exile was carried out, as Mr. Samuel Cox observes (and we have, perhaps, a specimen of the popular elegies upon him in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-1.htm">Ezekiel 19:1-4</a>): "A young lion of royal strain, caught untimely, and chained and carried away captive, - this was how the people of Israel conceived of Shallum" ('Biblical Expositions,' p. 120). The conjecture is incapable of proof; and Ezekiel, we know, was fond of imaginative elegies. But probably enough he was in harmony with popular feeling on this occasion. The identification of Shallum with Jehoahaz is confirmed by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> (Shallum, the youngest son of Josiah); the name appears to have been changed on his accession to the throne, just as Eliakim was changed to Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-4.htm">2 Chronicles 36:4</a>). There is, therefore, no occasion to suppose an ironical allusion to the short reign of Jehoahaz, which might be compared to that of the Israelitish king Shallum (somewhat as Jezebel addresses Jehu as "O Zimri, murderer of his lord," <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>). This view has the support of F. Junius (professor at Leyden, 1592), of Graf, and Rowland Williams; but why should not the Chronicler, though writing in the Persian period, have drawn here, as well as elsewhere in the genealogies, from ancient traditional sources? There is nothing in ver. 11 to suggest an allusion to the fate of the earlier Shallum.

He "had, besides, a passion for building splendid and costly houses; and as he esteemed his own position secure under the protection of a superior power, he did not scruple severely to oppress his helpless subjects, and wring from them as much money as possible" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' 4:252; see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-35</a>). The building mania, to which Oriental sovereigns have always been prone, had seized upon Jehoiakim. The architecture of the original palace no longer, perhaps, suited the higher degree of civilization; the space was as confined as that of a Saxon mansion would have appeared to a Norman. <span class="cmt_word">That buildeth his house by unrighteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as the second half-verse explains, by not paying the workmen (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>).

(This involves no change of letters, but a very slight rearrangement, and the alteration of one point; grammar gains greatly by the change.) "Cutteth out" is, literally, rend-<span class="accented">eth</span>; it is the word used in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a> of the apparent enlargement of the eyes by putting powdered antimony upon the eyelids. Windows are, as it were, the eyes of a building (Graf compares <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a>). Beams of cedar wood were used for the roof of the palace, as being the most costly and durable (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And painted</span> - rather, <span class="accented">and painting it - <span class="cmt_word"></span>with vermilion</span>; a taste derived from the Egyptians rather than the Babylonians, who seem to have had a difficulty in procuring red.

The second part of the clause must at any rate be. altered. Some render, "because thou viest (with thy forefathers) in cedar" (i.e. in building cedar palaces). Hitzig would strike out "in cedar," as having intruded from the preceding line (such a phenomenon meets us occasionally in the received Hebrew text), but this does not help us to a 'connected translation of the passage. Graf's rendering is grammatical, and not against usage; it is, "Dost thou reign because thou art eager about cedar-wood?" and yet the impression left on the mind is that there is some error in the text. The Septuagint finds a reference to one of Jehoiakim's predecessors, "because thou viest with Ahaz" (so the Vatican Codex), or, "... with Ahab" (so the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic or Friderico-Augustan). The latter king is celebrated in the Old Testament on account of his buildings, especially his ivory palace (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>:39). The former was at any rate addicted to the imitation of foreign ways (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did not thy father eat and drink?</span> There was no call upon Jehoiakim to live the life of a Nazarite. "Eating and drinking," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enjoying the good things within his reach, was perfectly admissible (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>); indeed, the Old Testament view of life is remarkable for its healthy naturalness. There was, however, one peremptory condition, itself as much in accordance with nature as with the Law of God, that the rights of other men should be studiously regarded. Josiah "ate and drank," but he also "did judgment and justice," and so "it was well with him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a></div><div class="verse">He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then <i>it was</i> well <i>with him: was</i> not this to know me? saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm">

"Covetousness" includes the ideas of injustice and violence (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>); hence the second half of the verse emphasizes the cruel tyranny which marked the internal policy of Jehoiakim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, <i>saying</i>, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, <i>saying</i>, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Josiah had been bitterly missed and universally lamented (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>); and so, only perhaps with less heartiness in most cases, Jehoiakim's other predecessors (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>). The Babylonian kings, too, received the honors of public mourning, e.g. even the last of his race, who surrendered to Cyrus, according to the British Museum inscription translated by Mr. Pinches. <span class="cmt_word">Ah my brother! or, Ah sister!</span> The Septuagint omits the latter part of this phrase, apparently because it seemed inappropriate to the death of Jehoiakim; but the parallelism requires a two-membered clause. According to Movers, the funeral procession is to be conceived of as formed of two parts, condoling with each other on having to share the same fate ('Die Phonizier,' 2. 248). Or perhaps mythology may supply a reason; it is possible that the formulae of public mourning were derived from the ceremonies of the Adonia; Adonis was an androgynous deity (Lenormant, 'Lettres assyriologiques,' 2:209), and might be lamented by his devotees as at once "brother" and "sister." (For another view, see Sayco's edition of G. Smith's 'Chaldean Genesis,' p. 267). Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-13.htm">Ezekiel 8:13</a>) testifies to the worship of Tammuz, or Adonis, and the highest compliment a king could receive might be to be lamented in the same terms as the sun-god. Jeremiah does not approve this; he merely describes the popular custom. The recognition of the deeply rooted heathenism of the Jews before the Exile involves no disparagement to Old Testament religion; rather it increases the cogency of the argument for its supernatural origin. For how great was the contrast between Jeremiah and his semi-heathen countrymen! And yet Jeremiah's religion is the seed of the faith which overcame the world. <span class="cmt_word">Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span> Lord is in the Hebrew <span class="accented">adon</span> (comp. Adonis and see above). <span class="accented">His glory</span> is against the parallelism; we should expect "lady" or "queen."

At first sight it appears to conflict with <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>, "So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead;" but it is only appearance, and when we remember that the complete formula for describing the natural death of a king of Judah is, "slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-24.htm">1 Kings 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-50.htm">1 Kings 22:50</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-24.htm">2 Kings 8:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-7.htm">2 Kings 15:7, 38</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-20.htm">2 Kings 16:20</a>), and that the phrase, "slept with his fathers," is used of Ahab, who fell on the field of battle (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-40.htm">1 Kings 22:40</a>), we are naturally led to the conjecture that Jehoiakim did not die a natural death, but fell in battle in some sally made by the besieged. <span class="cmt_word">Buried with the burial of an ass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cast out unburied. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond the gates;</span> rather, <span class="accented">far from the gates</span>.

The same figure is used in <a href="../../par/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>, "I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, and make thee as a signet;" and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>, where there is a well-attested reading, "Thou (O King of Type) art a deftly made signet-ring." (For the fulfillment of the prediction in this verse, see <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>.)

She seems to have been particularly influential (see introduction to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13.htm">Jeremiah 13</a>.)

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> this man Coniah a despised broken idol? <i>is he</i> a vessel wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is this man Coniah</span>, etc.? The prophet's human feelings are stirred; he cannot withhold his sympathy from the sad fate of his king. What! he exclaims; is it possible that this Coniah is treated as a piece of ill-wrought pottery ware (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-4.htm">Jeremiah 18:4</a>), and "hurled" into a strange land? <span class="cmt_word">He and his seed</span>. These words have caused some difficulty, owing to the youth, of Jehoiachin. According to <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a> he was only eighteen when he was carried captive, while <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> makes him still younger, only eight (Josiah's age on his accession). Hitzig thinks the latter number is to be preferred; his chief reasons are the prominence given to the queen-mother, and the fact that the length of Jehoiachin's reign is given with more precise accuracy in 2 Chronicles than in 2 Kings. It is true that the king's wives are mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. But that he had wives may, according to Hitzig, have been inferred by the late compiler of Kings from the passage before us; or the "wives" may have been those of Jehoiachin's predecessor (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). Graf's conjecture is, perhaps, the safest view of the case, whether we accept the number eighteen or the number eight; it is that the "seed" spoken of as born to Jehoiachin in his captivity, and is reckoned to him by anticipation. It should be mentioned, however, that the Septuagint omits "he and his seed" altogether.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man <i>that</i> shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write ye this man childless</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enter him in the register of the citizens (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>) as one who has no heirs.

This is all that the passage means; there is no discrepancy with history: how should there be, when Jeremiah himself has mentioned the posterity of Jehoiachin (ver. 28 and the latter part of this verse)? Yet the Septuagint thought it necessary to avoid the appearance of such a discrepancy by rendering, not "childless," but "one proscribed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 21"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/23.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 23"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 23" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
