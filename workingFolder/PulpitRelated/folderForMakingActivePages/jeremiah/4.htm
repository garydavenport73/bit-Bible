The clause, "and not wander," seems too short; the Septuagint had a choicer reading, "and put away, etc., from his [thy] mouth, and not wander from before me." It is the close of the prophecy which we have here. The prophet subjoins a promise which he has heard from Jehovah. True, it does not appeal to Israel's self-love (as <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13-16</a>), but to a nobler feeling of responsibility for the world's welfare. Israel has been entrusted with a mission, and on the due performance of this mission hangs the weal or woe of humanity. Hence Jehovah's longing for Israel's repentance. If Israel will but "return," and obey God's commandments, all nations will be attracted to the true religion. The form of expression used for the latter statement is borrowed probably from <a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a> (it is less closely parallel with <a href="../../par/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). To "bless <span class="accented">by"</span> any one is to use his name in the benediction formula. Seeing Israel so blessed through his allegiance to Jehovah, all nations shall wish themselves a similar blessing (the reverse of the process in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>). To "swear, As Jehovah liveth," means to call Jehovah to witness to the truth of a statement. This is to be done "with good faith," etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">the</span> object of the oath must be consistent with honesty and probity.

We have other instances of as sudden a transition from the Israelites (in the narrower sense) to the men of Judah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6-14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-6</a>; in the writer's commentary). <span class="cmt_word">For thus</span>, etc. "For" is here not causal, but explanatory: "I say this not only to the men of Israel, but to you, O men of Judah, who need the admonition to repentance, how deeply!" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Break up your fallow ground</span>; the same figure as in <a href="../../par/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>. To understand it we must read the clause in connection with the following one. <span class="cmt_word">Sow not among thorns</span>. The prophet means, though he does not say so, the roots which will spring up into thorns. "Do not plant your good resolutions in a heart filled up with the roots of thorns, but first rake up the soil, and clear it of noxious germs, and then sow the seed which will grow up in a holy life" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench <i>it</i>, because of the evil of your doings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Circumcise yourselves to the Lord</span>. A significant passage. All the Jews were circumcised, but not all were "circumcised to the Lord." There were but too many who were "circumcised in uncircumcision" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>), and the prophet sternly reduces ouch circumcision to the level of the heathenish rite of cutting off the hair (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; comp. Herod. 3:8). Jeremiah seems to have been specially anxious to counteract a merely formal, ritualistic notion of circumcision, sharing in this, as in other points, the influence of the Book of Deuteronomy, so lately found in the temple (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>). To him the venerable rite of circumcision (older, certainly, than Abraham) is a symbol of the devotion of the heart to its rightful Lord (comp. St. Paul in <a href="../../par/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-31.</span> - A revelation of grievous purport has suddenly reached the prophet. See how the foe draws nearer and nearer, and how alarm drives the scattered population to seek for refuge in the fortified cities. Can such be the issue of the promises of peace with which Jehovah has encouraged his people? Such are the contents of the first paragraph (vers. 5-10). Next,-in short, detached figures the prophet sets forth the sin of the people and its punishment. Like a scorching simoom is the former; like swift clouds, and like a whirlwind, is the onward march of the instruments of the latter. Swift, indeed, must repentance be, if it is to outrun punishment. For the northern peoples are already here (vers. 11-18). The impression is so strong on the mind of the prophet that he vents himself in language such as the last man might employ on the morrow of the final judgment day (vers. 19-26). And now, "lest what precedes might seem only poetry" (Payne Smith), the Divine decree is solemnly announced. The judgment is irrevocable; but there is a gleam of hope: "I will not make a full end." On the question whether the Scythians or the Baby-Ionians are mainly alluded to, see Introduction.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cry, gather together</span>; rather, <span class="accented">cry aloud</span>.

The "standard" was a tall pole with a flag, pointing in the direction of Zion, for the guidance of fugitives. <span class="cmt_word">Retire, stay not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">save your goods by flight</span>; <span class="accented">linger not</span>. The former verb occurs again in the same sense in <a href="../../par/exodus/9-19.htm">Exodus 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-31.htm">Isaiah 10:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">From the north</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-9.htm">Jeremiah 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, <i>that</i> the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The heart... shall perish</span>; i.e. they shall lose their reason. The same verb in Ethiopic means "to be mad." The "heart" in Old Testament language is the center of the intellectual as well as of the moral life (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>). So St. Ephrem the Syrian says ('Works,' in Syriac, 2:316, quoted by Delitzsch), "The reason expatiates in the heart as in a palace." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God</span>! rather, Alas! O <span class="accented">Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> on Jeremiah 1:6). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast greatly deceived this people</span>, etc. Much difficulty has been felt in interpreting this verse, partly because it seems directly to charge Jehovah with "deceit," and partly because the prophecy, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall have peace</span>, on which this charge is founded, accords exactly with the strain of the "false prophets" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>). Hence some (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ewald) have altered the points of the verb at the beginning of the verse., so as to enable them to render. "And one shall <span class="accented">say</span>," <span class="accented">the</span> subject understood being either a "false prophet" or one of the people. This view is not in itself impossible (Keil's objection will not bear  examination), but is not absolutely necessary, for the present is not the only passage in which Jeremiah, under the influence of strong emotion, charges Jehovah with "deceit" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>, a synonymous word is used; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-23.htm">1 Kings 22:23</a>), and the words, "Ye shall have peace, may be meant to summarize the cheering promises in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14-18</a>. Jeremiah may (it is not incorrect to conjecture) have supposed the fulfillment of his prophecy to be nearer than it really was (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>); hence his disappointment, and hence his strong language. So St. Jerome, "Quia supra dixerat, In illo tempore vocabunt Jerusalem solium Dei, etc.. et nunc dicit, Peribit cor regis, turbatur propheta et in se Deum putat esse meutitum; nec intelligit, illud multa post tempera repromissum, hoc autem vicino futurum tempore." To suppose, with Keil, that Jeremiah refers the prophecies of the "false prophets" to God as their ultimate Author, seems inconsistent with Jeremiah's own statements in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13</a>). Moreover, we have parallels elsewhere in the prophets, as well as in the Book of Job, for the use of language with regard to Providence which a calmer judgment would condemn. A notable instance is <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>, where the Jewish Church, through its mouthpiece the prophet, throws the responsibility of its errors upon Jehovah. Depressed by melancholy, they give way for the moment to those human "thoughts" which are not as "My thoughts." They felt the "burden of the mystery." <span class="cmt_word">Unto the soul</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. unto the life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall it be said to this people</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. words like these may be used with <span class="accented">reference</span> to this people. <span class="cmt_word">A dry wind</span>, etc.; literally, a clear wind (but the notions of dryness and heat are closely connected with that of heat; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>). The prophet doubtless means the east wind, which is very violent in Palestine, and, of course, quite unsuitable for the winnowing process. <span class="cmt_word">High places</span> should rather be bare <span class="accented">hills</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Toward</span>; or (is) the way cf. So Hitzig, supposing the conduct of the Jews to be likened to a wind which brings no blessing, but only drought and desolation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Even</i> a full wind from those <i>places</i> shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even a full wind from those places</span>. The passage is obscure, but this is a very possible rendering.  "Full," equivalent to "violent;" "those (places)," equivalent to the bare hills spoken of in ver. 11. Keil and Payne Smith, however, render, "a fuller wind than those," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a more violent wind than those which serve for winnowing the corn; while Hitzig (see on ver. 11) supposes "from those" to mean the persons described in ver. 11 as "the daughter of my people." <span class="cmt_word">Unto me</span>; or perhaps for me, at my beck and call. <span class="cmt_word">Now also will I</span>, etc. We must supply the other term of the antithesis from the context: "As they have sinned against me, so will I also now hold a court of justice upon them" (see on Jeremiah 1:16). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots <i>shall be</i> as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles.

How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy vain thoughts</span>. The phrase specially belongs to sins against one's neighbor - such sins as are described in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-9</a> (Keil). "Vain" should rather be "wicked" (immoral); the root-meaning of the noun is "a breath" (the symbol of material or moral emptiness).

It is doubted whether the speaker in vers. 19-21 is the prophet or the whole nation.

On the other hand, the phrase "my tents" (ver. 20) certainly implies that the people, or the pious section of the people, is the speaker. Both views may perhaps be united. The prophet may be the speaker in ver. 19, but simply (as is the case with so many of the psalmists) as the representative of his fellow-believers, whom in ver. 20 he brings on the stage more directly. Ver. 19 is best rendered as a series of exclamations - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"My bowels! my bowels! I must writhe in pain!<br />The walls of my heart!

So generally the one is more active, the other more passive.

Jeremiah uses a similar phrase in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a> (scrap. also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3</a>; also <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>, "city where David encamped, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. dwelt"). The expression is evidently a "survival" of the nomadic, tent-dwelling age. (Comp. the parallel phrase, "my curtains," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my tent-curtains; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-5.htm">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>.)

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a></div><div class="verse">For my people <i>is</i> foolish, they have not known me; they <i>are</i> sottish children, and they have none understanding: they <i>are</i> wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For my people is foolish</span>. The Lord gives no direct answer to the complaining question in ver. 21. He simply states the moral ground for Judah's calamity, and implies that this will last so long as the people continue to be "foolish," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. virtual deniers of the true God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a></div><div class="verse">I beheld the earth, and, lo, <i>it was</i> without form, and void; and the heavens, and they <i>had</i> no light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beheld</span>. The prophet is again the speaker, but in a calmer mood. God's judgment has been pronounced, and it is not for him to rebel. He has now simply to record the vision of woe which has been granted him. He foresees the utter desolation into which not only the land of Judah, <span class="cmt_word">but the earth</span> in general, will be brought, and which reminds him of nothing so much as the "waste and wild" condition of the earth previous to the first creative word. But why is "the earth" mentioned in this connection? Because the judgment upon Judah is but one act in the great general judgment which, when completed, will issue in a fresh order of things (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>, where side by side are mentioned Jehovah's judgment of "the peoples" and of "his people," and <a href="../../par/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>, where the judgment upon the enemies of Israel is interwoven with the judgment upon "the earth"). <span class="cmt_word">Without form, and void</span>; rather, waste <span class="accented">and</span> wild (to represent in some degree the characteristic assonance of the original - tohu <span class="accented">va-bohu</span>); more literally, <span class="accented">immovable and lifeless</span>. It is the phrase used in Genesis L 2 for primeval chaos. <span class="accented">Tohu</span> and <span class="accented">bohu</span> occur in parallel lines in <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>, to express utter desolation; <span class="accented">tohu</span> alone five times in the Book of Isaiah, and once in Job. <span class="cmt_word">They had no light</span>. The heavens were in the same condition as on the third day, subsequently to the creation of the heavens, but prior to that of the luminaries.

Not "the Carmel" (Keil, Payne Smith) for the context refers to the whole of the country, not to any single tract. The article before the two appellatives is the generic. <span class="cmt_word">At the presence of</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by reason of</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a></div><div class="verse">For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - The vision breaks off, and the prophet emphasizes its truthfulness by the announcement of the Divine decree. "Desolation, and yet not a full end," is its burden. This is the same doctrine of the" remnant" which formed so important a part of the prophetic message of Isaiah and his contemporaries. However severe the punishment of Judah may be, there will be a "remnant" which shall escape, and become the seed of a holier nation (<a href="../../par/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1, 2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a></div><div class="verse">For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken <i>it</i>, I have purposed <i>it</i>, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. because of the impending judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Be black</span>. "To be black" is equivalent to "to put on mourning" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a></div><div class="verse">The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city <i>shall be</i> forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The whole city</span>. The reading of which this is a version can hardly be the right one; for "the whole city" can only be Jerusalem, and in ver. 6 the people outside are bidden to take refuge in the capital. Hence Ewald, Hitzig, and Payne Smith (after Septuagint, Targum) would slightly amend the word rendered "city," so as to translate "the whole land" (of Judah). <span class="cmt_word">Shall flee</span>; <span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">fleeth</span>. So afterwards render, "have gone.... is forsaken," "dwelleth." It is a vivid dramatic representation of the effects of the invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Bowmen</span>. It is singular that Herodotus should say nothing about the use of the bow by the Chaldeans. But the monuments give ample evidence that they were a people of archers. So of course were the Scythians, as Herodotus testifies. <span class="cmt_word">The rooks</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the limestone caverns which abound in Palestine, and which were frequently used as strongholds and hiding-places (see <a href="../../par/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-11.htm">1 Samuel 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a> (especially); <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>when</i> thou <i>art</i> spoiled, what wilt thou do?

All these arts are in vain, for a violent repulsion has converted her lovers into her deadly enemies. And when Jerusalem is "spoiled," or taken by storm, what device will there be left to attempt? The "lovers" are the foreign powers to whom the Jews paid court (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18, 36</a>, 87). <span class="cmt_word">Though thou rentest thy face</span>, etc; alluding to the custom of Eastern women, who try to make their eyes seem larger by putting powdered antimony (the Arabic <span class="accented">kohl</span>) upon their eyelids. So, for instance, did Jezebel (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>:30); and one of Job's daughters received the name Keren-happuch, "box of antimony," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. one who sets off the company in which she is, as antimony does the eye. An old author, Dr. Shaw, writes thus: "None of these ladies take themselves to be completely dressed till they have tinged the hair and edges of their eyelids with the powder of lead ore. And as this operation is performed by dipping first into this powder a small wooden bodkin of the thickness of a quill, and then drawing it afterwards through the eyelids over the ball of the eye, we have a lively image of what the prophet (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) may be supposed to mean" (Shaw, 'Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 229).
