It is not allowable to suppose, with Keil and others, that "the word" describes the entire body of prophetic utterance in ch. 40-45. (in spite of the fact that ch. 44. and 45. have special headings). The use would be unexampled; and a prologue of forty verses (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>) is equally contrary to prophetic analogy. Apparently the "word," or prophecy, which originally followed the heading has been lost or removed to some other place. <span class="cmt_word">Had let him go from Ramah.</span> Here is an apparent discrepancy with the account in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>. The brevity of the latter seems to account for it. No doubt the more precise statement in our passage is to be followed. After the capture of the city, a number of captives, including Jeremiah, were probably conducted to Ramah (see on  <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), where they had to wait for the royal decision as to their fate. Jeremiah, however, had already been in custody in the "court of the watch," and the writer of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a> simply omits the second stage of his captivity (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">In chains.</span> See ver. 4, "The chains which were upon thine hand." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.</div><div class="comm">

This name is omitted in the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-23.htm">2 Kings 25:23</a>), and by the Septuagint here. It may, of course, be a corruption of Johanan, as Ewald supposes. If so, we must read "son" for "sons," with Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">The Netophathite.</span> Netophah was in the neighbourhood of Benjamin. <span class="cmt_word">The son of a Maachathite;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the Maachathite.</span> Maachah was a Syrian district in the neighbourhood of Hermon (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>). Jezaniah was, therefore, a naturalized foreigner, like Doeg the Edomite (Hitzig).

Observe, "wine" is here the wine in the grape; the Hebrew <span class="accented">yayin</span> seems originally to have meant a cluster of grapes, like the corresponding word (<span class="accented">wain</span>) in Arabic (setup. on ch. 48:33). <span class="cmt_word">That ye have taken;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that ye shall have taken.</span> (The "captains" had up to this time been in the open country, ver. 7.)
