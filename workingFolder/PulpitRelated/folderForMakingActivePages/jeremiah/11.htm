To whom is this addressed? To Jeremiah and his disciples. The Septuagint, indeed, followed by Hitzig and Graf, read (instead of "speak ye"), "Thou shalt speak unto them," adopting one different vowel-point. But this involves an inconsistency with the first verb, and is not at all necessary, for why should we suppose Jeremiah to have been completely isolated? If the prophet had well-wishers even among the princes, it stands to reason that he must have had more pronounced adherents in the classes less influenced by the prejudices of society. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-3.htm">Jeremiah 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed <i>be</i> the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Here begins a series of direct references to Deuteronomy, determining the date of the discourse. <span class="cmt_word">Cursed be the man</span>, etc.; alluding to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a> (which has, however, not "obeyeth," but "confirmeth," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. ratifieth as his own personal rule of conduct. <span class="cmt_word">The words of this covenant</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the words of this ordinance</span>. The rendering "covenant," however, is not so much erroneous as unsuitable in this context; it is a secondary meaning of the Hebrew <span class="accented">b'rith</span>, the original sense being rather "authoritative appointment" (from <span class="accented">barah</span>, to cut, hence to decide). Nothing, perhaps, is so injurious to a correct understanding of the Scriptures as persistently rendering a Hebrew or Greek word by the same supposed equivalent. "Covenant" is no doubt appropriate in some passages (e.g. <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>), because an "appointment" between men, if equals, involves "giving and taking;" but is inadequate when the parties are not equals, and most of all when the superior party is the Divine Being. In these cases we must clearly recur to the original meaning of" appointment" or "ordinance;" and we have one such case here (see also <a href="../../par/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/105-10.htm">Psalm 105:10</a>; but <span class="accented">not</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> (1, an arrangement; 2, a will or testament; 3, a covenant) is to some extent parallel (see Cremer's 'Biblico-Theological Lexicon of New Testament Greek,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.).

The-Hebrew has "Amen, Jehovah."

Others render, "read aloud" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>, Hebrew); but Jeremiah receives the direction to "proclaim" or "cry" elsewhere (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>, etc.).

The language is figurative. Jehovah is the King of Israel; to commit sin is "to rebel against" him (Authorized Version sometimes weakens this into "transgress'); and to encourage one another in wickedness is "to conspire against" God. We need not suppose any open combination against spiritual religion; it is enough if" the spirit of the time" was directly contrary to it.

The Hebrew has "their fathers, the former ones." The allusion is to the sins of the Israelites in the wilderness, and in Canaan under the judges. The prophets are constantly pointing their hearers back to those early times, either for warning (as here) or for encouragement (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-1.htm">Jeremiah 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And they went after</span>; rather <span class="accented">and they</span> (<span class="accented">themselves</span>) <span class="accented">have gone after</span>.

The name Baal is changed, to mark the abhorrence of the speaker, into Bosheth (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24</a>). Manasseh, we are told, "raised up altars for Baal" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear <i>them</i> in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore pray not thou</span>, etc. First Jehovah declares that even the intercession of the prophet will be of no avail (see on Jeremiah 7:16), and then that the belated supplications of the people themselves will be ineffectual to avert the calamity. <span class="cmt_word">For their trouble</span>. The four most ancient versions, and some of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, read "in the time of their trouble" (as in Ver. 12). The confusion between the  two readings is easy, and the reading of the versions is to be preferred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a></div><div class="verse">What hath my beloved to do in mine house, <i>seeing</i> she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What hath my beloved to do in mine house</span>? "My beloved" is evidently the Jewish people, who in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a> is called "the dearly beloved of my soul." The Divine Speaker expresses surprise that one who has now so poor a claim to the title of "my beloved" should appear in his holy house. It is spoken in the spirit of that earlier revelation of Isaiah, "When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>).  The Jews, it would seem, came to the temple to pray, but their prayer is not accepted, because it is associated with unholy practices. They thought by formal prayers and sacrifices to pay off their debt to the Deity, and so be free to go on with their old devices (as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>). This seems the best view of the difficult words which follow, but it implies a correction of the certainly ungrammatical rendering of the Authorized Version - <span class="cmt_word">seeing she hath wrought lewdness</span>  - into <span class="accented">to work the wicked device</span>. But here begins the most obscure part of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">With many</span> cannot be right; for "with" has nothing corresponding to it in the Hebrew; the word in the original simply means "the many," and as it is immediately followed by a noun in the singular with "and," and a verb in the plural, it is plain that it must (if correctly read) be part of the subject of the latter. The Septuagint, however, has a different reading, which may very well be correct, and out of which the received Hebrew reading may easily have grown - "Can vows and holy [i.e. hallowed] flesh remove from thee thy wickedness [or perhaps, 'thy calamity']?" The connection thus becomes easy. "Vows and holy flesh" (i.e. the flesh of sacrifices, <a href="../../par/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), naturally go together; the only other possible way of taking the passage (assuming the correctness of the 'received text) - " the great ones and the holy flesh shall pass away from thee" - is obviously inadmissible. "Vows and sacrifices," however, precisely express the true association of ideas. A man made a vow, and he generally paid it in the form of a sacrifice. But, inquires Jehovah, "Can such vows and such Victims please God, and expiate thy wickedness [or, 'avert thy calamity']? <span class="accented">Then thou mightest rejoice</span>." The latter words are not, indeed, more exact than those of the Authorized Version, but are in accordance with grammar, and suit the preceding question. It is not certain, however, that the text is right here; the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;</span>. (Notice that Keil, conservative to a fault in matters affecting the received text, agrees with the above correction, which is also adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, <i>and</i> of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A green olive tree</span>. The olive tree is "one of the most thriving, hardy, and productive trees in the East" (it was the first tree elected king in the parable, <a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>), and with its "foliage of a deep, perennial green," furnishes a striking symbol of healthful beauty. A psalmist, speaking in the character of the typical righteous man, compares himself to a "green olive tree in the house of God' (<a href="../../par/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>). The word rendered "green "is one of those which are the despair of translators (see on Jeremiah 2:20). It gives a picture in itself. We seem to see a flourishing, sappy tree, with abundance of pliant, gracefully moving, perennially green branches. <span class="cmt_word">With the noise of a great tumult.</span> Either the tumult of the <span class="accented">melee</span> of battle is meant (the same uncommon word is used with such a reference in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>) or the crashing of thunder. "With a rushing mighty sound" would be a more forcible rendering. (For the concluding figure, comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He hath kindled fire</span>, etc. There is no occasion to explain this as merely the perfect of prophetic certitude. It was literally true that the fire of war had already devastated the fairest portion of the Holy Land. Israel (expressly referred to in Ver. 17) had already been carried into captivity, and Judah was, to the prophetic eye, as good as destroyed. Here, no doubt, that wonderful perfect of faith does come in.

Jeremiah says that he was as unsuspicious as a tame lamb which has grown up with its master's family (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-3.htm">2 Samuel 12:3</a>). The Arabs use the very same adjective in a slightly different form as an epithet of such tame lambs (Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 1:520-522, edit. 1663). It is impossible to help thinking of that "Servant of Jehovah," of whom Jeremiah was a type, who is said, in prophetic vision, to have been "brought as a lamb to the slaughter," and "not to have opened his mouth "(<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tree with the fruit thereof</span>; apparently a proverbial expression. Giving the words their ordinary meaning, the rendering would <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">the tree with its bread</span> (<span class="accented">b'lakhmo</span>). Our translators appear to have thought that the transition from "bread" to "fruit" was as justifiable in Hebrew as it is in Arabic (in which '<span class="accented">uklu</span> means properly "food" in general, but also "date fruit"). Fruit, however, was not such an important article of food with the Israelites as with the Arabs; and we must either, with Hitzig, suppose a letter to have intruded into the text, and render (from a corrected reading <span class="accented">b'lekho</span>), <span class="accented">with its sap</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, Hebrew), or else appeal to the etymology of <span class="accented">lekhem</span> (commonly "bread"), which is "firm, consistent," and render, the <span class="accented">tree with its pith</span> (Hence <span class="accented">lahmu</span> in Arabic means "flesh," and <span class="accented">luhmatu</span>, "a woof"). It is no credit to St. Jerome that he followed the absurd version of the Septuagint, "Let us put wood into his bread." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a></div><div class="verse">But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - (Parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Unto thee have I revealed my cause.</span> This is the literal rendering, but a comparison of <a href="../../par/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>, suggests that the In meaning is Upon thee have I rolled my cause." This expression is certainly not only more forcible, but more appropriate than the other. Jeremiah's cause was not a secret which needed to be "revealed" <span class="accented">to</span> Jehovah, but a burden too heavy for so finely strung a nature to bear alone. Grammatically, the preferred meaning is quite justifiable, though less obvious, as there are other instances of an interchange of meanings between two classes of verbs (see on Jeremiah 33:6).

The Name of God is equivalent to his revealed presence or personality.
