Diodorus Siculus remarks 2:30) - and his statement is fully confirmed by the Babylonian cuneiform tablets - that "the appearance of comets, eclipses of the sun and moon, earthquakes, and in fact every kind of change occasioned by the atmosphere, whether good or bad, both to nations and to kings and private individuals [were omens of future events]." A catalogue of the seventy standard astrological tablets is to be found in the third volume of the British Museum collection of inscriptions. Among the items we read, "A collection of twenty-five tablets of the signs of heaven and earth, according to their good presage and their bad;" and again, "Tablets [regarding] the signs of the heaven, along with the star (comet) which has a corona in front and a tail behind; the appearance of the sky," etc. There can hardly be a doubt that the prophetic writer had such pseudo-science as this in his eye (see Professor Sayce, 'The Astronomy and Astrology of the Baby. Ionians, with translations of the tablets,' ere, in the <span class="accented">Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 3:145-339).

"People" should, as usual, be corrected into <span class="accented">peoples</span> - the heathen nations are referred to. The Hebrew has "the statutes;" but the Authorized Version is substantially right, customs having a force as of iron in Eastern countries. It seems to be implied that the "customs" are of religious origin (setup. <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-8.htm">2 Kings 17:8</a>, where "the statutes of the heathen" are obviously the rites and customs of polytheism. <span class="cmt_word">For one cutteth a tree</span>, etc. This is intended to prove the foregoing statement of the "vanity," or groundlessness, of idolatry. The order of the Hebrew, however, is more forcible, for <span class="accented">as wood out of the forest one cutteth it</span>, <span class="accented">viz</span>. the idol.

The close resemblance of this verse to <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>, will strike every reader.

This is the interpretation given to our passage in Ver. 70 of the apocryphal Epistle o! Jeremiah (written in the Maccabean period, evidently with reference to our prophecy), and is much more striking than the rival translation, "like a palm tree of turned work," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. stiff, immovable (comp. Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:110, 111; Horace, 'Sat.,' 1. 8, 1-4). <span class="cmt_word">They must needs be borne...  they cannot do evil</span>; a reminiscence, apparently, of <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>.

There is none like unto thee; none, that is, among those who claim to have Divine power (comp. the phrase, "God of gods," <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-2.htm">Psalm 136:2</a>). It would appear from some passages, however, as if the heathen did not worship mere nonentities (though idols are sometimes called "things of naught," <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ten times by Isaiah) by comparison with Jehovah, but that there was a dark background of awful personal or quasi-personal reality (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>).

As time went on, the sacred writers became more and more distinct in their assertions of the truth that Jehovah, the Self-revealing God, is not Israel's King only, but also of the world (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To thee doth it appertain</span>; viz. that men should fear thee. Forasmuch as, etc. (see above, on Ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">Among all the wise men</span>. "Men" is supplied, but doubtless rightly. It is a contest - how unequal a one! - between Jehovah and the sages of the heathen (comp. "Yet he also is wise," <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-2.htm">Isaiah 31:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <i>is</i> a doctrine of vanities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brutish and foolish</span>. In fact, the original meaning of the idolatrous religions had begun, probably, to fade, and the worship of Bel and Nebo had become (as the worship of the Egyptian gods became at a later period) increasingly formal and ritualistic. T<span class="cmt_word">he stock is a doctrine of vanities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">an instruction of vanities</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all that the idols can teach is vanities. Against this is the plural ("vanities," not vanity); it is more natural (and also more in accordance with usage; comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/41-26.htm">Genesis 41:26</a>, Hebrew) to render, <span class="accented">the instruction of the vanities is wooden</span> ("vanities" has the constant technical sense of "idols;" see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-19.htm">Jeremiah 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-6.htm">Psalm 31:6</a>). The clause then furnishes a reason for the folly of the heathen; how should they attain to more than a "wooden" knowledge, when the idols themselves are but wood? A bitter truth in an ironical form. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple <i>is</i> their clothing: they <i>are</i> all the work of cunning <i>men</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse apparently once followed Ver. 5. Like Vers. 7 and 8, it is omitted in the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">Silver spread into plates</span>, etc. The silver and gold were meant for the coating of the wooden image (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Tartessus, in south-west Spain, between the two mouths of the Baetis, or Guadal-quivir. <span class="cmt_word">Gold from Uphaz</span>. A place bearing this name, or anything like it, is not known from other sources than the Old Testament writings; and hence a corruption of the text has naturally been suspected (Ophir into Uphaz). As, however, r and z are not easily confounded, either in the earlier or the later Hebrew characters, this view must be abandoned, though it has the authority of several ancient versions of this passage (including the Peshite and the Targum). The name occurs again in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>. The Peshite, moreover, curiously enough, translates <span class="accented">zahab mufaz</span> in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a> (Authorized Version, "the best gold") by "gold from Ophir." <span class="cmt_word">Blue and purple</span>. The Hebrew has no word, strictly speaking, for either "blue" or "purple." Both these words here used probably express coloring matter rather than colors (this is certain of the latter word, which properly designates a kind of mussel, the shell of which yielded dye). The first produced a violet purple, the second a reddish purple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">But the LORD <i>is</i> the true God, he <i>is</i> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The true God</span>; literally, a God in truth, the accusative of apposition being chosen instead of the usual genitive construction, to emphasize the idea of "truth."

Whether it is a fragment of a Targum (or Chaldee paraphrase) representing a Hebrew verse really written by Jeremiah, or whether it is a marginal note by some scribe or reader which has found its way by accident into the text, cannot be positively determined. What is certain is that it is not in its right place, though it already stood here when the Septuagint Version of Jeremiah was made. To argue, with the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the latter circumstance is decisive of the correctness of the passage in its present position, implies a view of the unchangeableness of the text in the early centuries which few leading scholars will admit.

God's "voice" is the thunder (<a href="../../par/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>), which is accompanied by the gathering of heavy clouds ("His pavilion round about him," <a href="../../par/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He causeth the vapors to ascend,</span> etc.; the storm-clouds coming up more and more thickly from the horizon. From this point the verse agrees with <a href="../../par/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> (the psalm is full of such reminiscences, and is obviously very late). <span class="cmt_word">Lightning's with rain;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for the</span> rain. The lightning's are, as it were, the heralds or attendants of the rain. <span class="cmt_word">The wind out of his treasures</span>; a noble figure, used elsewhere of the snow and hail (<a href="../../par/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>), and of the waters of the sea (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>).

Jehovah. The phrase appears to have been coined at a lower level of religion, when every nation was supposed to have its own patron deity; just as the prophet says, ironically, to the fetish-worshippers of Israel, "Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>), and Moses, in Deuteronomy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), speaks of the host of heaven as having been "divided [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. assigned] unto all nations under the whole heaven." But, of course, the phrase is susceptible of a high, spiritual application (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>). God's people are, by their very conception, an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span>, chosen out by God, and choosing him, and not the world, for their portion.

How much more forcible is the original phrase: "... of the whole," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the universe!

Here, after describing dramatically the departure of the latter into exile, the prophet reports a distinct revelation of the same fact, so that this can no longer be assumed to be mere imaginative rhetoric.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, <i>and</i> a den of dragons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold... is come</span>; rather; <span class="accented">Hark!

Jeremiah and the people, each is, in a sense, the speaker; but here the prophetic faith seems to run rather in advance of that of his fellow-countrymen. They form, however, a fitting sequel to the charges brought against the people in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9</a>. The speaker admits that he (either the People of Judah personified, or Jeremiah as a representative of its best portion) fully deserves chastisement for having attempted to go his own way (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>). He has now attained an insight into the truth that man's duty is simply to walk in the path which God has marked out for him. He only asks that Jehovah would chastise him <span class="cmt_word">with judgment</span>, or,, more clearly, <span class="accented">according to what is just</span>. The contrast is between punishment inflicted in anger, the object of which is to cause pain to the criminal, and that inflicted as a duty of justice, and of which the object is the criminal's reformation" (Payne Smith). The fear expressed, however, is not exactly <span class="cmt_word">lest thou bring me to nothing</span>, which is too strong for the Hebrew, but lest <span class="accented">thou make me small</span>. Israel was secured against annihilation by the promise of Jehovah, but feared he might possibly survive only as the shadow of his former self.
