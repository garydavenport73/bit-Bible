It is important to get this "outside view" of the preaching of Jeremiah. There is evidently some excuse for the opponents of Jeremiah. It was a matter of life and death to resist the Chaldeans, and Jeremiah was, according to the politicians, playing into the hands of the enemy (see further in general Introduction). The addition of the words, that remain, shows that the bitter end of the resistance was fast approaching.

A grotto bearing the name of Jeremiah has been shown at Jerusalem since the fifteenth century. Under its floor are vast cisterns, the deepest of which professes to be the prison into which the prophet was thrown. The objection is that the sacred narrative proves that the prison was in the city, whereas "the present grotto was not included within the walls until the time of Herod Agrippa" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1881, p. 555). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Hammelech;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a royal prince</span> (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-26.htm">Jeremiah 36:26</a>).

Ebers remarks that the eunuchs employed are those on whom the shameful operation has been performed by Copts in Upper Egypt. Zedekiah's harem is referred to in vers. 22, 23.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-8.htm">Jeremiah 38:8</a></div><div class="verse">Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying,</div><div class="comm">

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-10.htm">Jeremiah 38:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty men.</span> Why so many were sent is not clear. Are we to suppose that the princes would resist Jeremiah's release? But "the king is not he," etc. (ver. 5). Is it not a scribe's error for "three" (so Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf)? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-11.htm">Jeremiah 38:11</a></div><div class="verse">So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Under the treasury;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to</span> (<span class="accented">a room</span>) <span class="accented">under the treasury. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Old cast clouts,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">rags of torn garments and rags of worn-out garments.</span>

Even Hezekiah, as Payne Smith well points out, had a numerous harem ('Records of the Past,' 1:39, where "daughters" is equivalent to "girls"). Zedekiah's own wives are spoken of in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Thy friends have set thee on,</span> etc. The first half of this taunting song (<span class="accented">mashal</span>) reminds of <a href="../../par/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a> (for other points of contact with Obadiah, see on Jeremiah 49:7-22). The meaning is that, after urging the weak-minded Zedekiah on to a conflict with the Chaldeans, they have left him involved in hopeless difficulties.
