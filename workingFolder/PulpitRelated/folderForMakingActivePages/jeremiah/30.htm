There are, no doubt, numerous allusions to preceding chapters, but ver. 5 seems rather to favour the latter view. The word rendered "book" will equally suit a short discourse like the present (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-60.htm">Jeremiah 51:60</a>) and a large collection of prophecies as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>. Observe, the discourse was to be written down at once, without having been delivered orally; it was to be laid up as a pledge that God would interpose for his people (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2, 3</a>).

Graf, in controverting Hitzig's view, points out, however, that the expressions referred to by Hitzig as "Deutero-Isaianic," are also found in other books besides the latter part of Isaiah, and that, on the other hand, "the expressions of ver. 11 are all as foreign to <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, as they are current in Jeremiah." As for the expression, "my servant Jacob." (which. only occurs again in Jeremiah in the duplicate of this passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>, and which is specially characteristic of the second part of Isaiah), it is worth noticing that it is found once in the Book of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), which, on Hitzig's theory, was written before the so called Second Isaiah. It still remains for the student to consider whether these two verses are not an insertion by some later hand (without attempting to discover whose that hand was). That the prophetic writings have received additions from editors and scribes is a fact which cannot reasonably be gainsaid, supported as it is by the phenomena of the historical books. It would be very natural for a pious Jew in the Captivity, not wholly devoid himself of the spirit of prophecy, to encourage his people, in the Name of the Lord, with this glowing word of promise.

It is remarkable that no reference is made here to the Messiah, who, in fact, is not as conspicuous a figure in the prophecies of Jeremiah as in those of Isaiah. And yet even in Isaiah there is one  striking prophecy in which the inspired seer uses language not (in the hands of a literalist) reconcilable with the prospect of the personal Messiah. The Messiah appears, as it were, in a lightning flash, and then disappears for a time. The prophecy of Isaiah referred to is <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1, 2</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>), in which the prospect of a truly God-fearing king, with princes of the same high character, entirely occupies the mind of the writer. "Nothing indicates that the Messiah is intended; king and princes are placed quite on a level, in accordance with the actual state of things under the so called monarchy." <span class="cmt_word">And I will cause him to draw near.</span> It is doubtful whether Israel or Israel's ruler is referred to. A priestly relation (such as "drawing near" implies, see <a href="../../par/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>) might be predicated of either, at any rate in the regenerate form of the Israelitish commonwealth; but it is more natural to suppose the ruler to be here indicated, for it is scarcely descriptive enough to say that he shall belong to the chosen people. <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that engaged his heart;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that pledgeth his heart</span> (or, <span class="accented">courage</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that ventureth.
