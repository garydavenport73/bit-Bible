The phrase is repeated three times to express earnestness of the speakers (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>, "O earth, earth, earth"). These false prophets evidently retained a large amount of the old materialistic faith of the Semitic nations (to whom the Israelites belonged by race), which localized the presence and the power of the divinity. The temple was, in fact, their palladium, and as long as it stood, the national independence appeared to them to be secured. They faithfully handed on the teaching of those prophets of the last generation, who, as Micah tells us (<a href="../../par/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), were wont to "lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us."

Still, the latter connection is both in itself the more probable one, and that suggested first of all by the accentuation (this, however, is not here decisive). It was not the extent of the original premise, but that of the enjoyment of the gift, which was in question.

Such a view, moreover, greatly weakens the force of the emphatic "We have escaped." "In order to do," etc., are the words of the prophet, who thus lays bare the secret intentions of these formal worshippers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a></div><div class="verse">Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?

Jeremiah attacks this false confidence in the temple of Jerusalem, by pointing to the destruction of an earlier sanctuary, of which very little is known, indeed only so much as to give an edge to our desire for more. It is certain, from <a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, that the tabernacle and the ark found a resting-place at Shiloh (an Ephraimitish town to the north of Bethel), nearly the whole of the period of the judges, or more exactly between the latter days of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) and the death of Eli (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>). Manifestly, then, there must have been some sort of "house," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. temple, at Shiloh; a mere tent would not have been sufficient for so long a period. This presumption is confirmed by the language of Jeremiah, and by the expressions of the narrative books. The fate which the prophet is bidden to announce for the existing temple is analogous to that which fell upon "Jehovah's place in Shiloh." The latter was, therefore, not merely a deportation of the ark, such as is referred to in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>. And when the narrator of the times of Samuel speaks of Eli as "sitting by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>), is it more natural to suppose t the word "temple" is here applied to the tabernacle, or that there was really a house, however rude, as sacred in the eyes of the faithful as was afterwards the splendid temple at Jerusalem? The latter view is strongly confirmed by <a href="../../par/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, "All the time that the house of God in Shiloh existed" (Authorized Version is misleading), and <a href="../../par/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>, where the Levite travelling to Mount Ephraim says, "I am going to the house of Jehovah." It is no doubt strange at first sight that so little information is given us as to this central sanctuary of the true religion; but are there not other omissions (especially in the history of the judges), which are equally strange as long as we look upon the Old Testament as primarily an historical document? We do know something, however, and more than is generally suspected; for when the right translation is restored in <a href="../../par/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, it follows, from a comparison of this and the preceding verse, that the temple of Shiloh was destroyed simultaneously with the captivity of the northern tribes. The impression produced by this emphatic announcement of Jeremiah is revealed to us by a later passage in his book (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a></div><div class="verse">And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rising up early and speaking</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> speaking zealously and continually (so ver. 25; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-5.htm">Jeremiah 26:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a>).

The word is peculiar (<span class="accented">kavvanim</span>), and perhaps entered Palestine together with the foreign rite to which the cakes belonged. Various conjectures have been offered as to their nature, but without any demonstrable ground. Sacrificial cakes were not uncommon. Hosea refers to the luscious raisin-cakes used by idolaters (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the queen of heaven.</span> This title of a divinity only occurs in Jeremiah (here and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-19, 25</a>). It reminds us, first, of titles (such as "queen of the gods") of the Babylonic-Assyrian goddesses, Bilat (Beltis) and Istar, who, though divided in later times, were "originally but two forms of the same goddess" (Sayce, <span class="accented">Transactions of Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 3:169). It is, however, perhaps an <span class="accented">objection</span> to the view that Bilat or Istar is intended, that neither here nor in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44.htm">Jeremiah 44</a>. is there any allusion to that characteristic lascivious custom which was connected in Babylonia with the worship of Istar (Herod., 1:199). The phrase has, however, another association. It reminds us, in the second place, of the Egyptian goddess Neith, "the mother of the gods." The first mention of "the queen of heaven" in Jeremiah occurs in the reign of Jehoiakim, who was placed on the throne by Pharaoh-Necho, one of the Saite dynasty (Says was the seat of the worship of Neith). If the "queen of heaven" were a Babylonic-Assyrian goddess, we should have looked for the introduction of her cultus at an earlier period (e.g. under Ahaz). But it was in accordance with the principles of polytheism (and the mass of the Jews had an irresistible tendency to polytheism), to adopt the patron-deity of the suzerain. Subsequently Judah became the subject of Nebuchadnezzar; thus it was equally natural to give up the worship of an Egyptian deity. Jewish colonists in Migdol would as naturally revert to the cultus of the Egyptian "mother of the gods" (see Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' Breslau, 1874, pp. 349-351). The form of the word rendered "queen" being very uncommon, another reading, pronounced in the same way, obtained currency. This should be rendered, not "frame," or "workmanship" (as Authorized Version, margin), but "service." The context, however, evidently requires a person.

Inferentially, this doctrine appears from the narrative of the Fall, and still more clearly from Isaiah's description of Paradise regained (11.). Hosea speaks of sufferings of the animals arising out of the guilt of Israel (<a href="../../par/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>), and a consciousness of the "solidarity" of all living creatures is ascribed to a Ninevite king in the Book of Jonah (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7, 8</a>). In general, the origin of this community of suffering is left mysterious, but in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a> it is expressly stated as the cause of the Deluge, that "all flesh [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. both man and beast.] had corrupted its way upon the earth;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. apparently, that contact with man had led to a corruption of the original innocence of the lower animals. It is a common experience that intercourse between Christianized (not to say civilized) man and the domestic animals produces a sometimes pathetic change in the psychic phenomena of the latter. Is the reverse process utterly inconceivable? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-28.</span> - Jeremiah dispels the illusion that God's claims are satisfied by a merely formal service. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put your burnt offerings</span>, etc. Throw all your sacrifices into a <span class="accented">mass</span>, and eat them at your pleasure.

The prophet here appears to deny <span class="accented">in tote</span> that Jehovah at Mount Sinai had given any injunctions on the subject of sacrifice. But the prophet must at any rate be consistent with himself; he cannot utter anything by Divine command which is fundamentally at variance with other equally authoritative declarations. Do the statements of Jeremiah elsewhere justify us in accepting <span class="accented">the</span> words in their literal, superficial meaning? There are three other passages which have a claim to be considered. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a> the prophet draws a picture of the happy condition in which the Jews might be, were they only obedient. One of the features of this picture is that the Jews would still bring all the various kinds of sacrifices to the house of Jehovah. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a> a similar description is closed with the promise to "satiate the soul of the priests with fatness," implying that there would be a great abundance of thank offerings in regenerate Israel. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>, among other blessings of the future, the prophet mentions the praiseful exclamations of those who would bring the sacrifice of thanksgiving. These passages do not contain any statement respecting the origin of the sacrificial system; but they do expressly assert that Jehovah contemplates that system with pleasure, and apparently that he designs it to be permanent among his people Israel. Let us now turn to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17-24</a>. Here the prophet, in the Name of Jehovah, declares that there is a Divine covenant "with the Levites, the priests," who shall never "want a man before me... to do sacrifice continually." A covenant with the priests implies a covenant with the people, the priests being the representatives of the people. This passage, therefore, is more distinct than those previously quoted; it does appear to maintain that the range of the Sinaitic covenant included the duties of the priesthood, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sacrifices. On the other hand, it should be observed that the genuineness of this latter passage is not beyond dispute, the whole section in which it occurs (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-26</a>) being omitted in the Septuagint. We have now to inquire, Is there a real discrepancy between the words of Jeremiah (strictly speaking, of Jehovah) in the verse now before us, interpreted literally, and the passages adduced above? Are they more inconsistent than such an utterance as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a> (first half of verse), which appears to deny the utility of sacrifices altogether? If the latter may be explained as a forcible oratorical exaggeration, why not also the present passage? Jeremiah sees the people attaching a pernicious importance to the opus <span class="accented">operatum</span> of sacrifice. On one occasion he tells them that Jehovah cares not for sacrifices; he means, as the context shows, the sacrifices of men without spiritual sensibilities. On another, that Jehovah never commanded their fathers to sacrifice; he means (may we not presume?) the mere outward forms of the ritual, divorced from the sentiment and practice of piety, which, as Hosea tells us (<a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>), Jehovah "delights in and not [equivalent to 'more than'] sacrifice." There is, therefore, no fundamental inconsistency between the passage before us and the three passages first quoted, and if so there can be no real discrepancy with the last-mentioned passage, for the priests (as was remarked) perform their functions on behalf of the people, and the permanence of Jehovah's covenant with the priests depended on the spiritual life of the people they represented (read <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33.htm">Jeremiah 33</a>, as a whole). This view seems less arbitrary than that of Ewald, who thinks that the sacrifices spoken of in our passage are merely the free-will offerings of the rich; and than that of Dahler, who interprets, "My chief care was not to prescribe rules for holocausts and sacrifices, but this is what I commanded thee above all," viz. moral obedience. According to it, the prophet's denial is not absolute, but relative - relative, that is, to the notion of sacrifices entertained by the Jews whom he addresses. Of course, Graf's view, that the denial is absolute, will equally well suit the context. The people were surprised at Jeremiah's objurgations, because they thought they had fulfilled the claims of the covenant. Jeremiah's purpose is equally well fulfilled whether his denial is qualified or unqualified, absolute or relative. Our object has been to separate the exegesis of our passage from a still doubtful controversy, and to offer a tenable view of it, based upon grounds purely internal to Jeremiah. It may be suggested, however, to the student of Leviticus, that even if the Levitical legislation in its present form were proved to be of a pest-Exile date, it would still be doubtful whether any believing temple-worshipper could help assuming that Jehovah had, from the first existence of the nation, given his direct sanction to the offering of sacrifices. If so, it is comparatively unimportant (except with regard to the progressive revelation of the strictness of the law of truth) whether the Levitical code was given to Moses at Mount Sinai in its present form or not.
