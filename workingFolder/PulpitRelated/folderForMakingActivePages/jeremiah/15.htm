For these were the nearest of all the prophets to Jehovah, and repeatedly prayed their people out of grievous calamity (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>).

Others following Rashi, take "mother" in the sense of "metropolis," or "chief city" (see Authorized Version, margin), in which case "young man" must be connected with the participle rendered "a spoiler;" but though the word has this sense in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a>, it is there coupled with "city," so that no doubt can exist. Hero the prophet would certainly not have used the word in so unusual a sense without giving some guide to his meaning.

The shame of childlessness is repeatedly referred to (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1, 23</a>).

They describe some deeply pathetic moment of the prophet's inner life, and in all probability belong to a later period of the history of Judah. At any rate, the appreciation of the next chapter will be facilitated by reading it in close connection with Ver. 9 of the present chapter. But the section before us is too impressive to be east adrift without an attempt to find a place for it in the life of the prophet. The attempt has been made with some plausibility by a Jewish scholar, Dr. Gratz, who considers the background of these verses to be the sojourn of Jeremiah at Ramah, referred to in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, and groups them, therefore, with another prophecy (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>), in which Ramah is mentioned by name as the temporary abode of the Jewish captives. We are told in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4, 5</a>, that Jeremiah had the choice given him of either going to Babylon with the exiles, or dwelling with the Jews who were allowed to remain under Gedaliah the governor. He chose, as the narrative in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a>. tells us, to stay with Gedaliah; but the narrative could not, in accordance with the reserve which characterizes the inspired writers, reveal the state of mind in which this difficult choice was made. This omission is supplied in the paragraph before us. Jeremiah, with that lyric tendency peculiar to him among the prophets, gives a vent to his emotion in these impassioned verses. He tells his friends that the resolution to go to Gedaliah may cost him a severe struggle. He longs for rest, and in Babylon he would have more chance of a quiet life than among the turbulent Jews at home. But he has looked up to God for guidance, and, however painful to the flesh, God's will must be obeyed. He gives us the substance of the revelation which he received. The Divine counselor points out that he has already interposed in the most striking manner for Jeremiah, and declares that if he will devote himself to the Jews under Gedaliah, a new and fruitful field will be open to him, in which, moreover, by Divine appointment, no harm can happen to him. Whether this is really the background of the paragraph must remain uncertain. In a case of this kind, we are obliged to call in the help of the imagination, if the words of the prophet are to be realized with any degree of vividness. There are some great difficulties in the text, and apparently one interpolation (Vers. 13, 14 being in all probability an incorrect copy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe is me, my mother</span>! This is one of those passages (comp. Introduction) which illustrate the sensitive and shrinking character of our prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"If his meek spirit erred, opprest<br />That God denied repose,<br />What sin is ours, to whom Heaven's rest<br />Is pledged to heal earth's woes?"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Cardinal Newman, in 'Lyra Apostolica,' 88.</span>). I have neither lent on usury, etc.; a speaking figure to men of the ancient world, to whom, as Dr. Payne Smith remarks, "the relations between the money-lender and the debtor were the most fruitful source of lawsuits and quarrellings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-11.htm">Jeremiah 15:11</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee <i>well</i> in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said</span>. The prophets are usually so tenacious of the same formulae that even their slight deviations are noteworthy. "The Lord said," for "Thus saith the Lord," occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25</a> (where, however, the phrase has possibly been detached by mistake from the preceding verse). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be well with thy remnant</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I have loosed thee</span> <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="accented">thy</span>) <span class="accented">good</span>, or, <span class="accented">thy loosing</span> (<span class="accented">shall be</span>) <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="accented">thy good</span>), according as we adopt the reading of the Hebrew text or that of the margin, which differs in form as slightly as it is possible to do. If we accept the historical setting proposed by Gratz for this paragraph, the reference will be to the "loosing" of Jeremiah from his chains mentioned in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>. The rendering given here is, however, only a probable one; it is in conformity with the Aramaic usage of the verb (the Targum uses it in this sense in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>), and is supported by its suitability to the context and, philologically, by the fact of the growing influence of Aramaic upon Hebrew. Gesenius, in his anxiety to keep close to the native use of the root, produces a rendering (of the Hebrew marginal reading) which does not suit the context, viz. "I afflict thee for (thy) good." Jeremiah does not complain of being afflicted by God, but that all the world is against him; Ewald, comparing a different Aramaic verb to that appealed to above, renders, "I strengthen thee," etc., which is adopted by Keil, but does not accord with the second half of the verse so well as the rendering adopted. The Authorized Version follows the Targum, the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Rashi, and Kimchi, assuming that <span class="accented">sherith</span> is contracted from <span class="accented">sh'erith</span> (as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), and that "remnant" is equivalent to "remnant of life." But, though the sense is not unacceptable (comp. Vers. 20, 21), the form of expression is unnatural; we should have expected <span class="accented">akharith'ka</span>, "thy latter end" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well</span>. This expression is as difficult as the preceding, and our rendering of it will depend entirely on our view of the context. If "the enemy" means the Chaldeans, the Authorized Version will be substantially correct. Rashi has already mentioned the view that the phrase alludes to Nebnzar-adan's respectful inquiry as to the wishes of Jeremiah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2-5</a>. In this case, the literal rendering is, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will cause the enemy to meet thee</span> (<span class="accented">as a friend</span>); comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>. But if "the enemy" means the Jews, then we must render, 1 <span class="accented">grill cause the enemy to supplicate thee</span>, and illustrate the phrase by the repeated applications of Zedekiah to the prophet (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a>), and the similar appeal of the "captains of the forces," in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1-3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-12.htm">Jeremiah 15:12</a></div><div class="verse">Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall iron break</span>, etc.? Again an enigmatical saying. The rendering of the Authorized Version assumes that <span class="cmt_word">by the northern iron</span> Jeremiah means the Babylonian empire. But the "breaking" of the Babylonian empire was not a subject which lay within the thoughts of the prophet. It was not the fate of Babylon, but his own troubled existence, and the possibility that his foes would ultimately succeed in crushing him, which disquieted this conscientious but timid spokesman of Jehovah. The Divine interlocutor has reminded him in the preceding verse of the mercy which has been already extended to him, and now recalls to his recollection the encouraging assurances given him in his inaugural vision (Jeremiah h 18, 19). Render, therefore, Can one <span class="accented">break iron</span>, <span class="accented">northern iron</span>, <span class="accented">and bronze?</span> The steel of the Authorized Version is evidently a slip. The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">n'khosheth</span>, which means sometimes (e.g. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-25.htm">Deuteronomy 33:25</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>) copper, but more commonly bronze, since "copper unalloyed seems to have been but rarely used after its alloys with tin became known" (Professor Maskelyne). "Steel" would have been more fitly introduced as the second of the three names of metals. "Northern iron" at once suggests the Chalybes, famous in antiquity for their skill in hardening iron, and, according to classical authors (e.g. Stephanus the geographer), the neighbors of the Tibareni, in the country adjoining the Euxine Sea, the Tibareni being, of course, the people of Tubal, whom Ezekiel mentions (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>) as trafficking in vessels of bronze. Any Jew, familiar with the wares of the bazaar, would at once appreciate the force of such a question as this. Even if iron could be broken, yet surely not steel nor bronze. Thus the verse simply reaffirms the original promises to Jeremiah, and prepares the way for Vers. 20, 21. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and <i>that</i> for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy substance</span>, etc. These verses form an unlooked-for digression. The prophet has been in a state of profound melancholy, and the object of Jehovah is to rouse him from it. In Vers. 11, 12, the most encouraging assurances have been given him. Suddenly comes the overwhelming declaration contained in Vers. 13, 14. And when we look closely at these verses, two points strike us, which make it difficult to conceive that Jeremiah intended them to stand here. First, their contents are not at all adapted to Jeremiah, and clearly belong to the people of Judah; and next, they are repeated, with some variations, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>. It should also be observed that the Septuagint (which omits <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1-4</a>) only gives them here, which seems to indicate an early opinion that the passage only ought to occur once in the Book of Jeremiah, though the Septuagint translator failed to choose the right position for it. <span class="cmt_word">Without price;</span> literally, not for a price. In the parallel passage there is another reading, "thy high places," which forms part of the next clause. Hitzig and Graf suppose this to be the original reading, the Hebrew letters having been partly effaced and then misread, after which "not" was prefixed to make sense. However this may be, the present reading is unintelligible, if we compare <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>, where Jehovah declares that his people were sold for nothing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were given up entirely to the enemy, without any compensating advantage to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And that for all thy sins,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">and in all thy sins and in all thy borders</span>. The text is certainly difficult. Externally a parallelism exists between the two halves of the clause, and one is therefore tempted to render literally. As this will not make sense, however, we are forced either to render as the Authorized Version, or to suppose that the text is not accurately preserved. The parallel passage has a different but not a more intelligible reading. Ewald omits "and" in both halves of the clause, which slightly diminishes the awkwardness. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make thee to pass</span>, etc. The natural rendering of the Hebrew is, "And I will make thine enemies to pass," etc., which clearly cannot be the prophet's meaning. The parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>) has, "And I will make thee to serve thine enemies," etc.; and so the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Targum, and many manuscripts here. <span class="cmt_word">For a fire is kindled in mine anger</span>; a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, suggesting that the judgment described in the Song of Moses is about to fall upon Judah.

"Take away," viz. my life (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-4.htm">Ezekiel 33:4</a>, "If the sword come and take him away"). <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke</span>; rather, <span class="accented">reproach</span>; cutup. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7</a> (<a href="../../par/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>. is in the style of Jeremiah, and, as Delitzsch remarks, suits his circumstances better than those of David). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a></div><div class="verse">Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy words were found</span>. Jeremiah here describes his first reception of a Divine revelation. Truth is like "treasure hid in a field;" he alone who seeks it with an unprejudiced mind can "find" it. But there are some things which no "searching" of the intellect can "find" (<a href="../../par/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>); yet by a special revelation they may be "found" by God's "spokesmen," or prophets. This is the train of thought which underlies Jeremiah's expression here. The "words," or revelations, of Jehovah are regarded as having an objective existence in the ideal world of which God is the light, and as "descending" from thence (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>) into the consciousness of the prophet. So <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>, "Eat that thou findest." <span class="cmt_word">I did eat them</span>; I assimilated them, as it were (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am called by thy name</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thy name hath been</span> (or, <span class="accented">had been</span>) <span class="accented">called upon me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have (or, had) been specially dedicated to thy service. The phrase is often used of Israel (see on Jeremiah 14:9), and, as here applied, intimates that a faithful prophet was, as it were, the embodied ideal of an Israelite. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a></div><div class="verse">I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of the mockers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the laughers</span>. The serious thoughts arising out of his sacred office restrained him from taking part in the festive meetings to which his youth would naturally incline him (comp. on Jeremiah 16:2). <span class="cmt_word">Because of thy hand</span>. The Hand of Jehovah is a figurative expression for the self-revealing and irresistible power of Jehovah; it is, therefore, equivalent to the Arm of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), but is used in preference with regard to the divinely ordained actions and words of the prophets. Thus we are told, in the accounts of Elijah and Elisha, that "the hand of the Lord came upon" them (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>). Such a phrase was probably at first descriptive of a completely passive ecstatic state, and was retained when ecstasies had become rare, with a somewhat laxer meaning. Isaiah uses a similar expression but once (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>); Ezekiel, however, who appears to have been unusually rifled with the overpowering thought of the supernatural world, is constantly mentioning "the hand of Jehovah" (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a>; and especially Ezekiel 3:14; 8:3). We may infer from this variation in the practice of inspired writers that, though symbolical, anthropomorphic language is not always equally necessary in speaking of Divine things, yet it cannot be entirely dispensed with, even by the most gifted and spiritual teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast filled me with indignation</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hadst filled me</span>. Jeremiah was too full of his Divine message to indulge in impracticable sentimentalities. There was no thought of self when Jeremiah received his mission, nor any bitterness towards those who up-posed him. His "indignation" was that of Jehovah, whose simple instrument he was (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>, "I am full of the fury of the Lord"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a></div><div class="verse">Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, <i>which</i> refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, <i>and as</i> waters <i>that</i> fail?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why is my pain perpetual</span>? One who could honestly speak of himself in terms such as those of Vers. 16, 17, seemed to have a special claim on the Divine protection. But Jeremiah's hopes have been disappointed. His vexation is perpetual, and his wounded spirit finds no comfort. <span class="cmt_word">As a liar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a deceitful stream</span>. The word "stream" has to be understood as in <a href="../../par/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>. Many of the water courses of Palestine are filled with a rushing torrent in the winter, but dry in summer. Hence the pathetic complaint of Job (<a href="../../par/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>). The opposite phrase to that used by Jeremiah is "a perennial stream" (<a href="../../par/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>). The force of the passage is increased if we read it in the light of Dr. Gratz's hypothesis. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-19.htm">Jeremiah 15:19</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, <i>and</i> thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou return</span>, etc. Most commentators regard these words as containing a gentle rebuke to Jeremiah for his doubts respecting God's care of him. It may be questioned, however, whether such passing doubts could be described as a turning away from Jehovah. If the word "return" is to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, we must surely conclude that the people is addressed (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a>). But this does not agree with the context. Hence Gratz's view seems very plausible, that the reference is to the proposal that Jeremiah should place himself under the protection of Gedaliah (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, "Go back also to Gedaliah," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Then will I bring thee again</span>; viz. into the right relation to me, so as to be my minister (Keil). But by altering one of the vowel-points (which form no part of the text), on the authority of the Septuagint, we get a more satisfactory sense, <span class="accented">I will give thee a settled place</span>. <span class="accented">The</span> verb must in any case be coupled with the following one. Jeremiah longs for a quiet home, only as supplying the conditions of prophetic activity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt stand before me</span>. The phrase is taken from the wont of slaves to stand in their masters' presence, waiting for commands. It is also applied to courtiers (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>) and royal councilors (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6</a>), to angels (<a href="../../par/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>) and to prophets (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>). Jeremiah was by God's will to find a new and important mission to the Jews with Gedaliah. <span class="cmt_word">If thou take forth the precious from the vile</span>, etc. The metaphor is derived from metallurgy (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27-30</a>). The prophet is compared to a smelter. By the fervor of his inspired exhortations, he seeks to draw away from the mass of unbelievers all those who are spiritually capable of better things. The "vine-dressers and husbandmen," whom Nebuzar-adan had left after the capture of Jerusalem, though outwardly "the poor of the laud," might yet be ennobled by the word and example of Jeremiah. [Some explain "the precious" and "the vile" differently, taking the former to be the pure Word of God (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>), the latter the base, human elements which are apt to be mixed with the Divine message (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>). But was it not the very fidelity of Jeremiah which exposed him to the persecutions of which he has been complaining? Others suppose an inward purification of Jeremiah himself to be intended, "the vile" being those human infirmities of which he had just given evidence, as opposed to "the precious," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the spiritual impulses which come from above. But is not such an explanation too evangelical, too Pauline, for this context?] <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be as my mouth</span>. For devoting himself to this possible "mustard seed" of a better and holier people, the prophet should be rewarded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by close prophetic intercourse with his God, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, as the next clause states, by a moral victory over his opponents. "Mouth" for "prophet," as <a href="../../par/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let them return unto thee,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">they shall return unto thee</span>, <span class="accented">but thou shalt not return unto them</span>. They shall come over to thy side, and thou shalt not need to make humiliating advances to them.
