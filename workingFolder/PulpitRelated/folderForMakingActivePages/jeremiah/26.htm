<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - The contents of the discourse (see especially on Jeremiah 7:12-15). The priests and the prophets interfere, arrest Jeremiah, and accuse him of a capital crime. It would appear that some at least of the "false prophets" were priests; thus Pashur, we are told, was a priest (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-5.htm">Jeremiah 26:5</a></div><div class="verse">To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending <i>them</i>, but ye have not hearkened;</div><div class="comm">

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - To all devout Jews this prediction of the destruction of the temple must have been startling; but to those who placed their confidence in the mere exist-once of a consecrated building (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>), it was like a blow aimed at their very life. Besides, were not the majority of the prophets of Jehovah of entirely another way of thinking? Did they not promise peace? And what could justify Jeremiah in announcing not merely war, but the downfall of the Divine habitation itself? Hence no sooner had the prophet concluded his discourse, than he was arrested, accused, and condemned to death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded <i>him</i> to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Had made an end of speaking</span>. They allowed Jeremiah to finish his discourse (of which we have here only the briefest summary), either from a lingering reverence for his person and office, or to obtain fuller materials for an accusation (comp. the trial of Stephen, <a href="../../par/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the people</span>. The "people" appear to have been always under some constraint. As long as the priests and prophets were alone, they dominated the unofficial classes, but when the princes appeared (ver. 11), the new influence proved superior. In ver. 16 princes and people together go over to the side of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die</span>. Death was the legal penalty both for blasphemy (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>) and for presuming to prophesy without having received a prophetic revelation (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). Jeremiah's declaration ran so entirely counter to the prejudices of his hearers that he may well have been accused of both these sins, or crimes. True, Isaiah and Amos had already predicted the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1, 2</a>); but it may have been contended that the timely repentance of Judah under Hezekiah and Josiah had effectually cancelled the threatened doom, and though <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a> evidently refers to a time later than Josiah, and represents the ruin of Jerusalem as practically certain, it would seem that the prophetic book (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.) to which this belongs (to say the least) was not generally known. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-9.htm">Jeremiah 26:9</a></div><div class="verse">Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Were gathered against</span>; rather, <span class="accented">assembled themselves unto</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> constituted themselves into a legal <span class="accented">qahal</span>, or assembly (see on ver. 17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a></div><div class="verse">When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S <i>house</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes</span>. The term will include the members of the various branches of the royal family, who acted as judges (see on Jeremiah 21:12), and the "elders," or heads of families (see ver. 17). Without the presence of the former, Jeremiah could only have had a mock-trial. <span class="cmt_word">Came up</span>, etc. (see on Jeremiah 22:1). <span class="cmt_word">Of the Lord's house</span>; better simply, <span class="accented">of the Lord</span>. The gate is the same which is referred at <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-11.htm">Jeremiah 26:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man <i>is</i> worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This man is worthy to die</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">sentence of death</span> (<span class="accented">belongs</span>) <span class="accented">to this man</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - Jeremiah's defense. He is conscious that he has not spoken uncommissioned, and leaves the result. He urges the people to amendment of life, while there is time, and warns them that his own unmerited death will bring a curse upon themselves. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</div><div class="comm">

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-17.htm">Jeremiah 26:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The elders of the land</span> add their voice in favor of Jeremiah, not, however, without first of all consulting the people whose representatives they are. The whole verse is thoroughly technical in its phraseology. The word (<span class="accented">qahal</span>) rendered "assembly" is the traditional legal term for the "congregation of Israel" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-30.htm">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>); comp. ver. 9, where the verb is the corresponding one to <span class="accented">qahal</span>. Thus, with all the faults of the government of Judah, which Jeremiah himself reveals to us, it was very far removed from the Oriental despotisms of our day. The "elders" are still an important element in the social system, and form a link with that earlier period in which the family was the leading power in the social organization. Originally the term denoted, strictly and in the full sense, heads of families; they have their  analogue in the councils of the Aryan village communities. "References to their parliamentary status (if the phrase may be used) occur in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>. The institution lingered on during and after the Babylonian Exile (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-14.htm">Ezra 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3, 47</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-43.htm">Mark 14:43</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-5.htm">Acts 4:5</a>, etc.)." We find another reference to their quasi-judicial authority in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-2.htm">Deuteronomy 21:2</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a></div><div class="verse">Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed <i>like</i> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Micah the Morasthite</span>, etc. The "elders" appeal for a precedent to the case of Micah (called after his native place, Moresheth-Gath, to distinguish him from other Micahs), who had been equally explicit in his declarations of woe to Jerusalem, without incurring the charge <span class="accented">of</span> blasphemy. The prediction referred to is in <a href="../../par/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>, the form of which agrees verbally with our passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-19.htm">Jeremiah 26:19</a></div><div class="verse">Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus might we procure</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and we are about to commit a great evil against our souls</span> (not merely "against ourselves"). The blood of the slain would cry for vengeance against his murderers, who would come to an untimely end, their "souls" being sent down to lead a miserable parody of a life (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">in</span> Sheol or Hades. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20</a></div><div class="verse">And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The murder of the prophet Urijah. At first sight, these four verses appear to belong to the speech of the elders, but the appearance is delusive, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the issue of the affair of Urijah cannot possibly have taken place "in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim" (ver. 1); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because the passage stands in no connection with what precedes, whereas it is related, and that very closely, to ver. 24 (see below). The case is similar to that of certain passages in St. John's Gospel, where the reflections of the evangelist are put side by side with the sayings of our <span class="accented">Lord</span>. Jeremiah, writing down his experiences at a later time, introduces the story of Urijah to show the magnitude of the danger to which he had been exposed. The notice of Urijah has an additional importance, as it shows incidentally how isolated a spiritual prophet like Jeremiah was, and how completely the order of prophets had fallen below its high ideal. We have no further knowledge of the prophet Urijah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kirjath-jearim</span>; a city in the territory of Judah, on the west frontier of Benjamin.

The "mighty men" (<span class="accented">gibborim</span>) are not mentioned again in Jeremiah, and the Septuagint omits the word. But it is clear from <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a> that the "mighty men" were recognized as an important part of the community. From <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a> it appears that the term indicates a position of high command in the army, which is in accordance with the notice in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Went into Egypt</span>. Egypt was the natural refuge for a native of Palestine (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-17.htm">1 Kings 11:17, 40</a> Matt, 2:14), just as Palestine was for a native of Egypt. The latter, however, proved to be not a safe asylum for Urijah, as Pharaoh was the liege lord of Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>), and the extradition of Urijah as a criminal naturally followed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22</a></div><div class="verse">And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, <i>namely</i>, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and <i>certain</i> men with him into Egypt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elnathan</span>.

One of his sons, Gemariah, lent Baruch his official room for the reading of the prophecies of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>); another was the well-known Gedaliah, who became governor of Judah after the fall of Jerusalem, and who was himself friendly to Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/25.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 25"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 25" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/27.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 27"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 27" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
