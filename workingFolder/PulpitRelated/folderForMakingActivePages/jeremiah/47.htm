Out of the north. To suppose that this refers to Pharaoh-necho returning from Carchemish seems forced and unnatural. If Necho conquered Gaza at the period supposed, it would be on his way to Carchemish, and not on his return. Besides," the north" is the standing symbol for the home of the dreaded Assyrian and Babylonian foes (see on Jeremiah 1:14). Isaiah had uttered a very similar prediction when the Assyrian hosts were sweeping through Palestine (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An overflowing flood;</span> rather, torrent. The same phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>, where the "breath" of the angry God is described with this figurative expression. It is in autumn time that the torrents of Palestine become dangerous, and water courses, dry or almost dry in summer (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>), become filled with a furiously rushing stream. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a></div><div class="verse">At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong <i>horses</i>, at the rushing of his chariots, <i>and at</i> the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to <i>their</i> children for feebleness of hands;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - A fine specimen of Hebrew word painting. <span class="cmt_word">The rushing of his chariots.</span> "Rushing" has the sense of the German <span class="accented">rauschen</span>, to make a rustling, murmuring sound. It is used (but as the equivalent of a different Hebrew word) in the Authorized Version of <a href="../../par/isaiah/18.htm">Isaiah 18</a>:12, 13 of the confused sound made by an army in motion. In the present passage, the Hebrew word means something more definite than that in Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>; it is the "crashing" of an earthquake, or (as here) the "rattling" of chariots. <span class="cmt_word">The rumbling of his wheels.</span> "Rumbling" is a happy equivalent. The Hebrew (<span class="accented">hamon</span>) is the word referred to in the preceding note as meaning an indefinite confused sound. <span class="cmt_word">The fathers shall not look back to their children,</span> etc. An awful picture, and still more effective in the concise language of the original. The Hebrew Scriptures excel (as still more strikingly, but with too great a want of moderation, does the Koran) in the sublime of terror. So overpowering shall the panic be that fathers will not even turn an eye to their helpless children. Observe, it is said "the fathers," not "the mothers." The picture is poetically finer than that in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56, 57</a>, because the shade of colouring is a degree softer. <span class="cmt_word">Feebleness of hands.</span> A common expression for the enervation produced by extreme terror (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a></div><div class="verse">Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, <i>and</i> to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The day that cometh;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the day that hath come</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall have come). It is "the day of the Lord" that is meant, that revolutionary "shaking of all things" (to use Haggai's expression, <a href="../../par/haggai/2-21.htm">Haggai 2:21</a>), as to which see further in note on Jeremiah 46:10. <span class="cmt_word">To cut off...  every helper that remaineth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every ally on whom they could still reckon. This passage favours the view that the judgment upon the Philistines took place at the same time as that upon Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar's object was to isolate Tyre and Sidon as completely as possible. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant.</span> The Philistines had suffered so much from repeated invasions as to be only a "remnant" of the once powerful nation which oppressed Israel (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">The country of Caphtor.</span> Some would render "the coastland of Caphtor," but the idea of "coast" seems to be a secondary one, derived in certain passages from the context. Properly speaking, it is a poetic synonym for "land,"  and is generally applied to distant and (accidentally) maritime countries. "Caphtor" was understood by the old versions to be Cappadocia. But as the remains of the Cappadocian language point to a Persian origin of the population which spoke it, and as the Caphtorim originally came from Egypt, it is more plausible to suppose, with Ebers, that Caphtor was a coast district of North Egypt. Crete has also been thought of (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a></div><div class="verse">Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off <i>with</i> the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - The prophet changes his style. In ecstasy or imagination, he sees the calamity which he has foretold already come to pass. Philistia is not, indeed, altogether annihilated; it was not the will of God to make a full end as yet with any of the nations round about. But it is reduced to extremities, and fears the worst. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baldness</span>. A sign of the deepest sorrow (comp. on Jeremiah 16:6). <span class="cmt_word">Ashkelon is cut off.</span> Ruins of Ashkelon are still visible. "It is evident that the walls of the old city were built on a semicircular range of rocky hills, which ended in perpendicular cliffs of various heights on the seashore. Wherever nature failed, the weak places were strengthened by the help of earthworks or masonry. On the southern and southeastern sides, the sand has penetrated the city by means of breaches in the walls, and every day it covers the old fortifications more and more, both within and without. The ancient towns alone rise distinctly, like rocky islands, out of the sea of sand. The ruins on the north are bordered by plantations of trees. They lie in such wild confusion that one might suppose that they were thrown down by an earthquake. There is no secure landing place; the strip of sand at the foot of the western wall is covered at high tide, when the waves beat against the cliffs. Still J.G. Kinnear, in 1841, found some remains of a mole, and this discovery is confirmed by Schick [the able German architect now at Jerusalem]." Thus writes Dr. Guthe, in the Journal of the German Palestine Exploration Society (1880), remarking further that, in a few generations, the ruins of Ashkelon will be buried under the drifting sand. It is partly the sand hills, partly the singular fragmentariness of the ruins of Ashkelon, which gives such an air of desolation to the scene, though, where the deluge of sand has not invaded, the gardens and orchards are luxuriant. Dr. W.M. Thomson, in the enlarged edition of  'The Land and the Book' (London, 1881, p. 173), observes that "the walls and towers must have been blown to pieces by powder, for not even earthquakes could throw these gigantic masses of masonry into such extraordinary attitudes. No site in this country has so deeply impressed my mind with sadness." <span class="cmt_word">With the remnant of their valley.</span> "With" should rather be "even." "Their valley" means primarily the valley of Ashkelon; but this was not different from the valley or low-lying plain (more commonly called the <span class="accented">Shefelah</span>) of the other Philistian towns; and the whole phrase is an enigmatical, poetic way of saying "the still surviving population of Philistia." But this addition certainly weakens the passage, and leaves the second half of the verse abnormally short. It is far better to violate the Massoretic tradition, and attach "the remnant," etc., to the second verse half. But "their valley" is still a rather feeble expression; a proper name is what we look for to make this clause correspond to those which have gone before. The Septuagint reads differently, for it renders <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;</span>. We know from <a href="../../par/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a> that some of the Anakim were left "in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod;" and in David's time the Philistines could still point to giants in their midst (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-16.htm">2 Samuel 21:16-22</a>), who, like the Anakim (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>), are called in the Hebrew, Rephaim. It may be objected, indeed (as it is by Keil), that the Anakim would not be traceable so late as Jeremiah's time; but Jeremiah was presumably a learned man, and was as likely to call the Philistines Anakim, as an English poet to call his countrymen Britons. No one who has given special attention to the phenomena of the Hebrew text elsewhere can doubt that "their valley" is a corruption; the choice lies between the "Anakim" of the Septuagint and the plausible correction of a Jewish scholar (A. Krochmal), "Ekron." <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou cut thyself?</span> Shall thy lamentation never cease? (comp. on Jeremiah 16:6). The question is in appearance addressed to "the remnant" (personified as a woman), but in reality the judicial Providence who sends the calamity.
