It was also familiar to the Assyrians: King Assurba-nipal declares at the opening of his ' Annals ' that the gods "in the body of his mother have made (him) to rule Assyria." Familiar, too, to the great family of religious reformers. For, as Dean Milman has truly observed, "No Pelagian ever has or ever will work a religious revolution. He who is destined for such a work must have a full conviction that God is acting directly, immediately, consciously, and therefore with irresistible power, upon him and through him He who is not predestined, who does not declare, who does not believe himself  predestined as the author of a great religions movement, he in whom God is not manifestly, sensibly, avowedly working out his pre-established designs, will never be saint or reformer" ('Latin Christianity,' 1:111, 112). <span class="cmt_word">Sanctified thee</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. set thee apart for holy uses. <span class="cmt_word">Ordained</span>; rather, <span class="accented">appointed</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the nations</span>. Jeremiah's prophecies, in fact, have reference not only to Israel, but to the peoples in relation to Israel (ver. 10; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46-49</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50</a> and Jeremiah 51.?).

Jeremiah's duty is simple obedience. In put-suing this path he cannot but be safe (ver. 8).

Jeremiah had said that he was unskilled in oratory; the Divine answer is that the words which he has to speak are not his own, but those of Jehovah. Two things are obvious: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The touching of the lips is not purely metaphorical, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>); it represents a real experience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> This experience, however, can only have been a visionary one, analogous to that vouchsafed to Isaiah at the opening of his prophetic ministry. In the grand account given by Isaiah of his inaugural vision (which has evidently influenced the form of the vision of Jeremiah), we read of the same significant act on the part of one of the seraphim. It is the same act, certainly, but it symbolizes, not as here the communication of a prophetic message (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>), but the purification of the lips. Does it not seem as if Isaiah had attained a deeper insight into the spiritual regeneration needed by the prophet than had been granted to Jeremiah? Another point in which Jeremiah's account seems inferior to that of Isaiah is plastic power. Notice how Jeremiah dwells upon the meaning of the words; this is a reflective element which diminishes the poetic power of the narrative. A word may Be added to explain that "visionary" is not here used in opposition to "based on fact." That the two epithets are susceptible of combination is well shown in the vision described by Pere Gratry, in his 'Souvenirs do ma Jeunesse' (pp. 102-105), the reality of which is not in the least impaired in the writer's mind by its thoroughly inward character: "Dens teutes ces seines interieures, je n'imaginais rien... c'etaient de saisissantes et tres-energiques realites auxquelles je ne m'attendais nullement."

As there is so much more threatening than promise in Jeremiah's writings, the destructive side of his activity is expressed by four verbs, the constructive only by two. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou?

Two visions are granted him, which he is required to describe. The first expresses the certainty of his prophetic revelation; the second indicates its contents. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A rod of an almond tree</span>. The name here adopted for the almond tree is peculiarly suitable in this connection. It means "wakeful;" the almond, blossoming in January, is the first to "wake" from the sleep of winter.

And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof <i>is</i> toward the north.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A seething pot</span>. There is a variety of Hebrew words for "pot." The word here used suggests a vessel of large size, since pottage for a whole company of prophets could be cooked in such. a pot or caldron (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>). From <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a> we may infer that it was of metal. A "seething pot" in ancient Arabic poetry is a figure for war. The same symbol occurs in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3-12</a>, but with a different application. <span class="cmt_word">The face thereof is toward the north</span>; rather, <span class="accented">toward the south</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from the face of the north</span>. The "face" of the pet is the side turned to the prophet. We may suppose the contents to be on the point of boiling over.

Previously to the battle of Carchemish, the Babylonians are only mentioned vaguely as a northern people (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>). Strictly speaking, they were an eastern people from the point of view of Palestine; but the caravan-road which the Chaldaean armies had to take entered Palestine at Dan (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-15.htm">Jeremiah 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>), and then proceeded southward. (On the question whether a Scythian invasion is referred to, at least conjointly with the Babylonian, see Introduction.) <span class="cmt_word">An evil</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the evil</span>; viz. the calamity which in deepening gloom forms the burden of the prophet's discourses. <span class="cmt_word">Shall break forth</span>; literally, shall <span class="accented">open</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. let loose by opening (comp. the use of the same verb in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>, literally, "looseth not his prisoners homewards;" and <a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>, literally, "that we may open," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "bring forth wheat"). There is, however, some difficulty in explaining the choice of this expression. We might indeed suppose that the caldron had a lid, and that the removal or falling off of this lid is the "opening" referred to by the phrase. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will call</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I am calling</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. I am about to call. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdoms of the north</span>; alluding possibly to the varied origin of the population of Assyria and Babylonia. But more probably it is simply a suggestive phrase, for the wide extent of the hostile empire referred to (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall set every one his throne</span>, etc. The kings, or. the, generals, representing "all the families, etc., shall set up the high seat of power and judicial authority at the broad space within the gate of the city, which constituted the Oriental forum (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>). Thither the besieged would have to come to surrender themselves (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>) and to hear their fate. A similar prediction is made with regard to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9, 10</a>). It is true the seat of authority is there said to be placed at the entrance of the palace, but this was in fact another place where justice was wont to be administered (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-2.htm">Jeremiah 22:2, 3</a>). Jerome's view, adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Nagelsbach, that "to set one's seat" means "to besiege" is against usage, and does not accord with the opening words of ver. 16. There is, however, an element of truth in it. The judgment executed ministerially by the northern kings or generals began with the siege of Jerusalem and the other cities, and hence the words with which the prophet continues. <span class="cmt_word">And against all the walls</span>, etc. We should have expected something like "and shall set themselves in array against," etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a> b); see, however, last note. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will utter my judgments</span>; or, I <span class="accented">will hold a court of justice upon them</span>; literally, I <span class="accented">will speak judgments with them</span>. The expression is peculiar to Jeremiah (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>), and includes both the examination of the accused, and the judicial sentence (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All their wickedness</span>, etc. Their "wickedness," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. their infidelity to Jehovah, showed itself in burning incense to "other gods," and bowing down to their images. "Burned incense" is, however, too narrow a sense. The root-meaning of the verb is to be fragrant, and the causative conjugations will strictly mean only "to make a sweet odor," whether by the offering of incense or by burnt offerings (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>, where a causative conjugation is used in the same wide sense here postulated; also <a href="../../par/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>, where the word usually rendered "incense" seems rather to mean "a sweet smoke"). The prophet says, "of other gods" (not "of false gods"), out of consideration for the ignorance of his hearers, to whom Baal and Moloch really were as gods; in fact, that expressive word (cf.) which Isaiah uses ten times to express the unreality of the other so-called gods, occurs only once, and then not in quite the same sense (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>) in Jeremiah. But the prophet's own strict monotheism is proved by such passages as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>a; Jeremiah 8:19b; Jeremiah 16:20. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gird up thy loins</span>, as an Oriental does before making any kind of physical exertion, whether walking (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>), running (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>), or fighting (<a href="../../par/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be not dismayed</span>. A want of confidence on Jeremiah's part will issue in his utter discomfiture by his enemies. "Dismay" in Hebrew has a twofold reference, subjective ("dismay") and objective ("ruin," "discomfiture"). Both references can be illustrated from this verse. (Comp. the command and - ver. 18 - premise to Jeremiah with the command and promise to Ezekiel -  3:8, 9.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brasen walls</span>. The plural is used instead of a collective term for the whole circle of fortifications. In the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>) the singular occurs; the same alternation of plural and singular as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>. The combination of figures strikingly expresses the invincibility of one whose strength is in his God. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Judah</span>. Why the plural? Most reply, Because Jeremiah would have to do with successive sovereigns. But this meaning would have been just as well conveyed by the singular: "the king of Judah," without any name being added - would moan the king who from time to time happened to be reigning. "Kings of Judah" in Jeremiah seems to have a special meaning, and to include all the members of the royal family, who formed a numerous and powerful class (see on Jeremiah 17:20).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
