<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a></div><div class="verse">Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, <i>and</i> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-10.</span> - Babylon's fall and Israel's deliverance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - The prophet, with the eye of faith, sees his revelation accomplished. Babylon (like Moab) <span class="accented">is</span> taken; her idols <span class="accented">are</span> destroyed. In his exuberant joy, he calls on the bystanders to proclaim the good news to the sympathetic nations, and to <span class="cmt_word">set up</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">lift up</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>a standard</span> (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>), to call the attention of those who might not be within hearing of the proclamation. The idols have been convicted of false pretensions; they are <span class="accented">ashamed</span> and <span class="accented">dismayed</span> (so we should render rather than <span class="cmt_word">confounded</span> and <span class="cmt_word">broken in pieces</span>) at the terrible result to their worshippers. <span class="cmt_word">Bel</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Merodach</span> are not different deifies, but merely different names of one of the two principal gods of the later Babylonian empire. Bel, it is true, was originally distinct from Merodach, but ultimately identified with him. Merodach was the tutelary god of Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar seems to have been specially addicted to his worship, though, indeed, he mentions Nebo also with hardly less honour. This is the beginning of an inscription of this king's, preserved at the India House: - "Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, glorious prince, worshipper of Marduk, adorer of the lofty one, glorifier of Nabu, the exalted, the <span class="accented">possessor</span> of intelligence" (Mr. Rodwell's translation, 'Records of the Past,' 5:113). Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar speaks of Marduk as "the god my maker," "the chief of the gods," and of himself as "his (Marduk's) eldest son, the chosen of his heart." Her images. It is a very peculiar word (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>), specially frequent in Ezekiel, and also found in a chapter of Leviticus with which Ezekiel has affinities (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>). It evidently involves a sore disparagement of idol worship. The etymological meaning is "things rolled," which may be variously interpreted as "idol blocks" (Gesenius), or "doll images" (Ewald). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-3.htm">Jeremiah 50:3</a></div><div class="verse">For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of the north.</span> There was a peculiar mystery attaching to the north in the Hebrew mind, as, in fact, the word very for "north" in Hebrew (literally, <span class="accented">the hidden</span>) indicates. The burnt offering was to be sacrificed on the north side of the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>), and the four cherubim, in the vision of Ezekiel, are described as coming from the north (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>). The horror with which Babylon was regarded was intensified, apparently, by its northern position (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>), and now the "hidden" north again pours forth its swarms of warriors against Babylon herself. <span class="cmt_word">They shall remove, they shall depart;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they are fled, they are gone</span>; almost the same clause occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>. The prediction is realized as past. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a></div><div class="verse">In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days,</span> etc. The destruction of Babylon is immediately followed by the deliverance of Israel. But the description of the latter is a remarkable one. We are by no means to regard it as an idealized  picture of the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, any more than we can suppose the glowing promises in the second part of Isaiah to have their sole fulfilment in that disappointing event. No; it is the characteristic of Messianic prophecy that, with "foreshortened perspective," the prophets represent as equally near events which are really separated by ages. In the Book of Isaiah, for instance, preliminary judgments are repeatedly described in terms which, properly speaking, only apply to the great final judgment. In fact, each great political revolution is a stage in the Divine drama of judgment, which will reach its close in the final cataclysm. And so too here (as well as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-46</a>.) the promise of mercy to Israel, which began to be fulfilled in the edict of Cyrus, is represented as if the still future conversion of the people of Israel were actually accomplished. The description reminds us of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18-21</a>. Notice the penitence of the returning exiles, and the reunion of Israel and Judah (see on Jeremiah 3:18). <span class="cmt_word">Going and weeping; they shall go;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they shall go, weeping as they go.</span>

The addition, "that shall not be forgotten," reminds us of "the ark of the covenant," which was "not to be remembered" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>).

But now that he had wandered from Jehovah, and so forfeited his protection, his adversaries denied that they could be brought to account. <span class="cmt_word">Habitation of justice;</span> strictly, <span class="accented">pasture of righteousness.</span> The same title is applied in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-23.htm">Jeremiah 31:23</a> to Jerusalem. But Jerusalem's spiritual efficacy is only derivative; rest and life flow from Jehovah alone, who is, therefore, the true Pasture of his people. In the Hebrew, "Jehovah" is placed emphatically at the end of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">The hope of their fathers</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-4.htm">Psalm 22:4</a>).

The marginal rendering of the Authorized Version represents a various reading of the Hebrew found in three old editions, and presupposed in the Targum and Vulgate, "one making childless," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a destroyer." The received reading, however, is self-evidently right. <span class="cmt_word">None shall return in vain.</span> It seems doubtful whether this refers to the arrow or to the mighty man. The arrow may be said to "return [or, 'turn'] in vain" when it misses its aim or strikes the mark without piercing it (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>, where, however, it is the sword which is thus spoken of); the mighty man when he retires from the field defeated. This wider use of the phrase is sanctioned by <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.

The ruin wrought by the lions is described first as "devouring" and then as "breaking the bones" of Israel - in either case it is complete destruction, but the completeness is more emphasized by the second figure.

Probably enough an actual geographical name may lie at the root of this singular expression; but we are not able at present to say what it was. The prophet has, at any rate, modified it in such a way as to convey a definite meaning, symbolic of the character of Babylon (comp. on ver. 31). What was this meaning? According to Gesenius, there is an allusion to the two great blows inflicted on Israel and Judah by Assyria and Babylon respectively; but as these two powers were but the instruments of a higher Hand, this explanation would seem to be inconsistent with the prophetic teaching. Dahler, De Wette, and Keil take the two rebellions to be the spiritual ones of idolatry and pride; and there is no obvious objection to this. But the dual may be simply intended to express intensity; comp. ch. 17:18, "Destroy them with double destruction" (see note). <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Pekod</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. of punishment. But here too a geographical name very probably lies underneath. The Taylor cylinder inscription of Sennacherib mentions a Pukudu (  =   Pekod), together with Havrann (Hauran) and Nabatu (Nabathaeans); but this was the name of a tribe. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a> we read, "The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa," etc.; and in 'Records of the Past,' 11:92, we find a town Pikudu mentioned, lying to the south of Babylon, which may, perhaps, have given its name to a district, and to this district the prophet not improbably alludes. M. Halevy conjectures that the event which corresponds to the prophecy is the decisive battle which virtually terminated the Babylonian empire. According to the newly discovered Cyrus inscription, this battle was fought near a place called Rutu, which appears to have been situated in the neighbourhood of Pukudu ('Records,' <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). About the symbolic meaning there can be no doubt: Pekod is a worthy pendant to Merathaim. Sin and punishment are so closely connected in the prophetic mind that one word sometimes  covers both notions. It is doubtful, for instance, whether the better rendering of <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a> is "draw sin as with a cart rope" or "draw punishment."

In the next chapter a similar title is conferred upon Israel, with the right to retaliate upon Babylon all the evil which Babylon had done to Zion (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-24</a>). Compare the epithet <span class="accented">Martel</span>, "The Hammer," given to Charles, Duke of the Franks, on account of his great victory over the Saraoens at Tours; it is tempting to add "Makkabi," the epithet of Judas (Maccabaeus), but the <span class="accented">k</span> is not the same letter as that in <span class="accented">maqqab</span>, hammer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-24.htm">Jeremiah 50:24</a></div><div class="verse">I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have laid a snare for thee.</span> It was very natural, as long as Cyrus's own account of the capture of Babylon was unknown, to refer for a fulfilment to the stratagem which, as Herodotus relates, that king employed, viz. diverting the waters of the Euphrates into an already existing reservoir, and entering the city unexpectedly by the river channel (Herod., 1:191). But the cylinder inscription, translated by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1880, shows that Babylon opened its gates of its own accord, on hearing the defeat and capture of Nabonidus. There is no occasion to look for any further fulfilment of the prophecy than the surprise which must ever come upon the bystander when he sees a mighty empire suddenly pass into the hands of its enemies. The tenses in this verse are not very happily rendered. It would be better to translate, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">laid a snare for thee, and thou wast taken, O Babylon, unawares</span>; <span class="accented">thou wast found, etc., because thou hadst striven against the Lord.</span>

A truly grand figure. The north country (the "hidden" part of the earth, as it was called in Hebrew) is regarded by the prophet as a storehouse of young and "inexhaustible" nations, from which Jehovah can at any time "bring forth weapons of his indignation." The latter phrase, occurs again in the parallel prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>), where it is evidently applied to the army of Medo-Persian invaders. <span class="cmt_word">For this is the work,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a></div><div class="verse">Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come against her;</span> rather, Come to her. Dr. Payne Smith infers that Babylon has already fallen, and that the persons addressed are not warriors only, but plunderers of every kind. This is almost too subtle. The prepositions "to" and "against' (literally, upon) are so frequently interchanged (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the utmost border;</span> rather, <span class="accented">all</span> to<span class="accented">gether</span>; it is an idiom expressing universality. Those who are spoken of are regarded as a totality, "from the utmost end" of which its members come. <span class="cmt_word">Cast her up as heaps;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Cast it up as sheaves</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ransack the repositories of Babylon's wealth, and heap it up like corn; last of all, <span class="cmt_word">destroy her</span> (rather, <span class="accented">it</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>utterly</span>. The verb is a very emphatic one. Its primary meaning is "to cut off, or shut off." Hence <span class="accented">kherem</span>, a devoted thing, is applied in the Law to that which is "tabooed," as it were, cut off from any but sacred uses. In <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a> it is used of a field wholly appropriated to the sanctuary, and in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a> and <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a> to living beings doomed to destruction. Destruction is generally a part of the meaning; but it is not merely destruction, but an act of homage to the Divine justice.

Because the oppression of Israel and Judah still continues, whereas Israel has by this time been amply punished ("received double," <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>) for her transgressions, Jehovah will himself interpose. He is, in fact, Israel's <span class="accented">Goel</span> ("Redeemer"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> charged, like the next of kin, with the duty of recovering thy rights and avenging thy wrongs (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-14.htm">Isaiah 41:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>).

It was the wont of the Chaldeans, as Habakkuk puts it (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>), "to walk through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that were not theirs." Observe the striking contrast - "rest" to the world which has been too long deprived of it, and "disquiet" to those who have hitherto spread it far and wide (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2, 3</a>).
