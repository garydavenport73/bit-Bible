The discourse which now follows was the Lord's parabolic or allegoric reply to the conduct of the Pharisaic malignants. These men, claiming to be infallible guides of the ignorant, to be veritable shepherds of the flock of God, had ignored the advent of the true and good Shepherd, had opposed the Divine call and supreme claim of the Messiah, had set themselves to disturb and dislocate the relations between him and those who saw his glory and found in him the Consolation of Israel. They had excommunicated the adoring disciple who had passed out of lifelong darkness into marvelous light. They had exaggerated the faint glimmer of light which had broken upon their own blindness into true vision. They had said, "We see," and thus shown themselves to be willfully in the wrong. Their sin abode upon them. The fold of God's sheep was something different from their own expectations and definitions. Their way into it proved that they did not know its true nature. To meet this crisis our Lord delivers a triad of related and parallel pictures, which differ from the ordinary parable (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>). The parable is a picture which is complete in its elf, and invites the reader to discover some answering spiritual truth. It consists of a careful setting forth of some physical fact, some fragment of biography, some personal or domestic detail. It is true to life and experience, and embodies some ethical principle or religious emotion; and while it does not explicitly teach either, yet it suggests them to the inquiring mind. The parables of the synoptic Gospels are not exclusive or rigid in their form. The so-called parable of "the Pharisee and the publican" and that of "the good Samaritan" are at once transformable into patterns or principles of action. The element of its own interpretation is also conspicuous in that of "the rich man and Lazarus" and "the rich fool." With these latter specimens of our Lord's teaching may be compared the allegoric illustrations of the present discourse. These pictures are "transparencies" (Godet), through which the Savior's spiritual teaching pours its own illumination. They both alike differ from the "fable," a form of address in which personal characters and activities are attributed (as in the apologue of Jotham, etc.) to the irrational or even to the inanimate creation. The first of the similitudes before us has more of the character of the parable proper, because it does not at once carry its own interpretation with it. Vers. 1-6 represent in parabolic form the claims of those who aspired to provide a "door," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a sure and safe entrance to the theocratic fold. In vers. 7-10 our Lord interprets and expands the first representation by giving special significance to the words he had already used, adding something to their meaning, and contrasting his own position with that of all others. From the eleventh to the eighteenth verse he once more reverts to the original picture, and claims to occupy a relation to the sheep of God's band of far more intimate and suggestive kind than what was connoted by the <span class="accented">door</span> into the fold. He is "the good Shepherd." In that capacity he adds other and marvelous features. The parabolic or allegorical language passes away into vivid description of the leading features of his work. The parable at last glows into burning metaphor. In the first paragraph our Lord gives a parabolic picture of flock and fold, door and porter, robber and shepherd. In the second paragraph he emphasizes the relation between the <span class="accented">door</span> and the fold, claiming to be "the <span class="accented">Door</span>." In the third he illustrates the function and the responsibility of the true "Shepherd," and the relation of the shepherd to the <span class="accented">flock</span>, and he claims to be the Shepherd of Israel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The parable of the fold and flock</span>, <span class="accented">the door and the porter</span>, <span class="accented">the robber and the shepherd</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>Verily, verily</span>, betokens the deep solemnity and importance of the matter in hand, but not a complete break in the circumstances - neither a new audience nor a new theme. The adoption by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>), by Ezekiel (34.), and by Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-4.htm">Zechariah 11:4-17</a>) of similar imagery to denote the contrast between the true and false shepherds, and the anticipation by the prophets of a time when the true and good Shepherd would fulfill all Jehovah's pleasure, throws vivid light on these words of our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</span> Several commentators of eminence have maintained that by "the <span class="accented">door</span>," in this first verse, our Lord (as in ver. 7) meant at once to designate himself. This is not necessary. He rather summons the Pharisees to recognize the fact that there is a door, a way of sure and divinely appointed admission to the "fold of the sheep," through which the veritable Shepherd passes, bringing his flock with him by well-known voice and manner. Later on, our Lord claims to be the one Way' by which all under-shepherds can gain true access to the flock, and all the sheep of God's pasture can find protection and freedom; but here he suggests the principle of discrimination between a true shepherd and a thief or robber. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is one who is selfishly seeking his own ends, and would avoid detection; the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is one who would use violent means to secure his purpose (Judas was a "thief," Barabbas was a "robber"). The false shepherd disdains the door, and climbs up some other way along his own selfish lines of action (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is used in this place only, equivalent to "from some other quarter than the ordinary home of the shepherd"). His purpose is not to benefit the sheep, but to seize them, or slaughter them for his own purposes (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). The Lord suggests that many have assumed to sustain the relation of shepherd to the flock and fold of God, with no inward call either of commission or profession. They have been eager to insist on their own rights, have mistaken their own narrow traditions for the commandments of God, have imposed upon starved and worried souls their own selfish interpretations of that commandment, and have shown that they had no legitimate access to the hearts of men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-2.htm">John 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that enters in by the door is a shepherd of the sheep</span>. Let him be who he may, Pharisee or priest, prophet or king, pastor or evangelist, unless he approach the sheep by the right "way" he demeans and condemns himself. If he come by the door into the fold, he may be so far presumably a shepherd. One fold might contain several flocks, and a shepherd might lead these flocks into different enclosures according to his wisdom and care for his sheep. Neander, Godet, and Watkins think it possible that the whole imagery may have been borrowed from the eye. The shepherds towards evening were probably gathering their scattered flocks, according to Oriental custom, into their well-known enclosures, and Jesus with his audience might have seen them doing it if they gazed out from the courts of the temple over the neighboring hills (see also Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1:301, a passage which provides an admirable commentary on this parable). There is no absolute need that the customary and well-known habit of the country-side should have been visible at the moment. The abundantly attested practice furnished to his hearers all needful corroboration. The deeper significance of the passage lies in the prophetic symbolism of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. Jehovah was the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>), and he would appoint once more in their Messiah-King a David, who should be his gracious Representative and Agent. All these representations were gathered up in Christ's wonderful parable of the lost sheep (<a href="../../par/luke/15-3.htm">Luke 15:3-7</a>). Thoma endeavors to credit the author of the Gospel with this ideal picture of the contrast between the true and false shepherd. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To him the porter openeth</span>. The doorkeeper of the fold has been variously interpreted. Bengel and Hengstenberg say, "God himself" is meant; Stier, Alford, and Lange, "the Holy Spirit;" against which interpretations may be urged the subordinate position assigned to the "porter," as compared with the shepherds themselves. Lampe and Godet think that "John the Baptist" was intended; while Meyer and De Wette say that it is one of those elements of the parable which is dropped out of our Lord's own exposition for which we need not seek any special application. Westcott thinks it must vary with the special sense attributed to "sheep" and "shepherd," and float we must think of it as "the Spirit working through his appointed ministers in each case." The "doorkeeper," if Christ be himself the "Door," is the keeper of that door - the agency, the ministry, the ordinances by which the excellences and power of Christ were or are manifested. We are reminded of subsequent use of the imagery in Paul's Epistles (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>); but the full meaning of the phrase is only suggested, and we had better wait for Christ's interpretation of some parts of this allegory. The context provides a specific filling out, first of one part of the imagery, and secondly of another part of it. The two interpretations are not to be forced at one and the same time upon the parable. Our Lord continues: <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep hear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">voice</span>. When a shepherd approaches the door to fetch the folded sheep which belong to him, the porter opens that door for him <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a true shepherd who has at heart the interests of the sheep and of their supreme Owner, finds the way made ready for him. In the fold are many flocks. All the sheep give heed to his voice. <span class="cmt_word">He calleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</span> They know a shepherd calls, and then that shepherd addresses his own sheep by name, and he leads these forth into the pasture. Even in our own pastures the shepherds know each sheep by name. Aristotle ('Hist. Anim.,' 6:19) tells us the bell-wether knew his name, and obeyed his shepherd. Archdeacon Watkins gives a quotation from Theocritus' 'Idylls,' charmingly illustrating the habit. The shepherd, by the mere call to his own sheep, would separate them from these which did not belong to him, and lead them forth to their pasture in the wilderness. This method of Oriental life illustrates the function of all true shepherds of men. It has had many partial fulfillments in the history of the Church and of the world. Daring the period of the old theocratic dispensation, many "thieves and robbers" made havoc of the flock; still there were prophetic and kingly men who, sent by God, found their way to the heart of Israel; many came to know that a prophet had been among them, and they followed him. It is equally true now, though all the external conditions are changed. The full application of this part of the allegory is only seen when "the good Shepherd" seeketh his sheep; but the meaning of the first picture is obscured by hurrying on to the enlarged and double exposition which Christ gave of the two parts of his own parable, and much is lost by endeavoring to force into a primary exposition of vers. 1-6 the features borrowed from a twofold interpretation of the separate ideas suggested by the composite image. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In like manner, our Lord continues to describe what every true shepherd of men has done and ever will do: <span class="cmt_word">When he hath put forth all</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own</span>, and not another's, drawn them by the music of his voice, or constrained them by the sweet violence of his love, or even compelled them to go forth from a fold in which they may find security, but not pasture; and when he has marshaled them into obedience and into thankful trust by the strength of his sympathy and knowledge of their need, <span class="cmt_word">he goeth before them.</span> He is their leader and example; he shows them in his own life the kind of provision made for them; he shares with them the perils of the wilderness, and first of all is prepared to grapple with their fierce foes, "He drinks of the brook in the way." The highest meaning, the only complete interpretation, of this passage is found when Christ himself is the Shepherd, who does summon from the old enclosure "all his own," all who have entered into living harmony with himself. <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</span> Nothing is here said of "lost sheep" or of "goats;" these are all the "ideal sheep" of the flock, individuals who recognize the voice of the true Leader, and discriminate their own shepherd from all others, whether pretenders to their affections or destroyers of their lives  - wolves or butchers, thieves or robbers. Should we persist in interpreting the apologue as it stands, a question arises about the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> that are not the shepherd's" own." Some have answered it by supposing that the latter are the chief of his own flock, who will bring the rest after them. The truth is not obscurely hinted of that election to highest privileges and duties, which does not declare that the rest are not sheep at all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-5.htm">John 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But a stranger will they by no means follow, for they know not the voice of strangers.</span> The negative is strongly expressed. The sheep, who know their shepherd's voice, will not take the lead of a stranger or an alien; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of a "thief or robber." If these secure the sheep at all, it is by violence or stealth, by unfair means, by illegitimate methods. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-6.htm">John 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This parable spake Jesus unto them</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only in this place and in <a href="../../par/john/16-25.htm">John 16:25-29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>. It is the LXX. rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> proverb, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>, a similitude or didactic saying. The Greek word means any speech (<span class="accented">ethos</span>) deviating (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) from the common way (Lange). It may deviate by its sententious or parabolical form, which conceals under a closed metaphor a variety of meanings. <span class="cmt_word">But they,</span> the Pharisees, who were confident of their own position, and gloried in their influence over men, and whose moral nature was steeled and armed to resist even a possible reference to themselves as "thieves," or "robbers," or "aliens," and who would not admit any of Christ's claims to their own disparagement, <span class="cmt_word">understood not what things they were which he was saying to them.</span> The blind man had heard Ms voice, obeyed, found healing, advanced step by step from a bare knowledge of "a man Jesus" to a confession of him as one empowered by God; to a belief that he was a "Prophet," able to relax Mosaic Law; and finally to a ready acknowledgment that he was the Son of God. The Pharisees were conscious of neither need, nor blindness, nor desire of salvation, nor of the Shepherd's care or grace. They will not go to him for life. They can make nothing of his enigmatic words. They take counsel against him. Their misconception contrasts strongly with the susceptibility of the broken-hearted penitents. So far the parable or proverb corresponds with the parables of the kingdom in the synoptic Gospels, and is open to many interpretations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-7.htm">John 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Allegory of the door and the fold</span>, <span class="accented">in which Christ claims to be</span> "the <span class="accented">Door of the sheep</span>." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, with its resumptive force, introduces the effect upon Christ of the unsusceptible character of the Pharisees). Some pause may have occurred, during which these men displayed their bitter feeling and utter lack of appreciation, and he proceeds first to give them an explanation of the words, which should leave them in no doubt as to <span class="accented">one</span> emphatic meaning which they contained; <span class="cmt_word">Said</span> <span class="cmt_word">again unto them, I am the Door of the sheep,</span> This exposition of the allegory is introduced by the solemn <span class="cmt_word">Amen, amen</span>. Christ first calls attention to the "door" into the sacred fellowship of men with God. On a subsequent occasion (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), he said, "I am the Way" to the Father; "no man cometh unto the Father, but by <span class="accented">me</span>." The parable as it stands refers to true and false teachers of the people, and to just and unjust claims to confer upon the sheep of God's pasture safe and sure access to God, and all privileges of Divine life. In interpreting it, he declares first that he is the one <span class="accented">Door</span>, not of "the fold" so much as <span class="accented">of the sheep</span>, in their individual capacity. This corresponds with every claim made by him and made in his Name, that he, in all the fullness of his Personality, had always been the one Medium by which, in the theocracy or beyond it, men have drawn near to the Father. The Logos is the Angel of the covenant, the Rock in the wilderness, the great High Priest, the Veil over the holy place, the propitiatory Sacrifice, the Prophet, the King. He it is who ever and always has given consolation and peace to his people. He is the one method, agency, reality, by which not only the shepherds, but the sheep, enter into the fold, and go forth thence to pasture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that came before me</span> <span class="cmt_word">are thieves and robbers</span>. Great difficulty has been felt by commentators in understanding "before me." The words clearly gave the early Gnostic heretics a text on which they established their dualistic rejection of the old dispensation. Their absence from certain texts led Augustine and others to emphasize the word "came." "All who <span class="accented">came</span>," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in their own strength or wisdom, when not "<span class="accented">sent"</span> or authorized by God. Other endeavors have been made (see Meyer and Lunge) to give it a non-temporal meaning, such as <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, "independently of <span class="accented">me</span>." Wolf and Olshausen make <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>, "<span class="accented">in</span> the place" or "in the stead of me" (so Lunge, Lampe, Schleusner). De Wette and others accept the temporal meaning, "before," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in point of time, and include under it the entire <span class="accented">corpus</span> of Old Testament saints and teachers, and therefore regard the saying as inconsistent with the gentleness of Christ. But with <a href="../../par/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39, 45-47</a>, and many other passages in this Gospel, it is certain the words could not mean to denounce all who came as teachers or shepherds before him in mere <span class="accented">point of time</span> as "thieves and robbers," whom the sheep did not hear. Therefore the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> must be to some extent modified in meaning. We agree with Westcott and Godet in limiting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>, by throwing the emphasis on the "came," and by adding, moreover, to it the essential point, "came making themselves doors of the sheep" - claiming to have the "key of knowledge," professing vainly to open or shut the door of heaven. That is, no other has ever had the right or claim to be such "a door." The Baptist, the prophets, one by one, Abraham and Moses, in their day made no such profession. The dignity belongs to Christ alone. The language may receive accentuation from the pressing urgency of false Christs, as well as the hopeless system of Pharisaic pride. Theme sees here the mere dressing out of St. Paul's language, condemnatory of false prophets and ravening wolves who would not spare the flock of Christ (<a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>), and Christ's own words in the synoptists (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, etc.). Special reference is made to the ceremonial superstitions, to "the hedge about the Law," to the cruel slavery of modern Pharisaism, which had done what neither prophets nor priests of old had attempted. Archdeacon Watkins emphasizes the present tense, "<span class="accented">are</span> thieves," etc., making Christ's reference obvious to the lawyers and scribes of his own day, who were closing the door, and plundering those whom they kept out of the kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">But the sheep did not hear them</span>. The true sheep have not been seduced by them. The teaching of these Pharisees has not prevailed over susceptible souls. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the Door: by me</span> - by living relation to me - <span class="cmt_word">if any man</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either shepherd or sheep, for in this part of the interpretation they are not distinguished, and they alike need "salvation" and "pasture." <span class="cmt_word">By me if any man enter, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</span> "Salvation" here spoken of refers primarily to deliverance from dangers, protection from the ravenous wolves without the fold, and from false shepherds within. "Go in and out" is a phrase frequently used "to denote the free use of an abode by one who is at home in the house" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21</a>). The believer who enters into fellowship with God, and is "saved," does not "go in and out" of that state, but can as a child share by turns the Divine repose of the home, and the high privilege of his sonship in the world. "He claims his share in the inheritance of the world, secure of his home" (Westcott). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <i>it</i> more abundantly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy.</span> Christ, elaborating, evolving, what is contained in the image of "thief," regards his rival as the thief of souls; he whose pretension to be a way to God is based on no inward and eternal reality, who comes for no other purpose than to make the sheep his own, not to give them pasture; to sacrifice them to his selfish ends, to use them for his own purposes, not to deal with them graciously for theirs; but to destroy, since in the pursuit of his selfish ends he wastes both life and pasture. A terrible impeachment, this of all who have not recognized the true Door into the sheepfold, who would shut up the way of life that they may exalt their own order, would diminish the chances of souls in order to secure their own position. This forms the transition to the second interpretation of the parabolic words; for he adds, <span class="cmt_word">I came that they might have life, and that they might have it abundantly</span>; more even than they can possibly use. This is one of the grandest of our Lord's claims. He gives like God from overflowing stores (<a href="../../par/titus/3-6.htm">Titus 3:6</a>). Those who receive life from him have within them perennial sources of life for others - fullness of being (see notes, <a href="../../par/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). One of the differentiae of "life" is "abundance" of supply beyond immediate possibility of use. Life has the future in its arms. Life propagates new life. Life has untold capacities about it - beauty, fragrance, strength, growth, variety, reproduction, resistance to death, continuity, eternity. In the Logos is <span class="accented">life -</span> and Christ came to give it, to communicate "life to the non-living, to the dead in trespasses, and to those in their graves" (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-21.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">The functions and responsibilities of the veritable Shepherd</span>, <span class="accented">and the relation of the Shepherd to the flock</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the good Shepherd</span>. The word here rendered "good" means more than the "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) or the" veritable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); more than <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, good, in the sense of being morally excellent and inwardly fulfilling God's purpose that the sheep should be shepherded. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a "goodness" that is conspicuous, that shows and approves itself to the experience and observation of all. Thus the Lord fills up the meaning of the first parable by emphasizing another element in it. There may be many shepherds worthy of the name, but he alone justifies the designation (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>.). This imagery has inwrought itself into Christian literature and art. The earliest representations of Christ in the catacombs depict him as "the good Shepherd" (Tertullian, 'De Fuga.,' c. 11; Hermas, 'Sire.,' 6:2); the earliest hymns and latest minstrelsy of the Church dwell fondly on the image which portrays his individual watchfulness, his tender care, his self-sacrificing love. <span class="cmt_word">The good Shepherd layeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">down his life for the sheep</span>; not only does his work with his life in his hand, but he deliberately lays down his life and consciously divests himself of his life, and is doing it now. The Shepherd dies that the sheep may live (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). Elsewhere Jesus says, "The Son of man gives his life a ransom for many" (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>). The thought is very grand, and is a strange addition to the claim to be the Shepherd of Israel, and gives intense pathos to the language of our Lord to Simon Peter (<a href="../../par/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>), "Shepherd my sheep." The further development of the parable shows that in the metaphor he regards his death as no disastrous termination of the Shepherd's function, but as an event in his career. Hence it is not just of Reuse ('Theol. Chretien,' 2.) to contend that our Lord does not here suggest a vicarious or propitiatory death on his part. This is a veritable death, which secures the life of the sheep, and does not arrest the Shepherd's care (see vers. 17, 18). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/mark/1-20.htm">Mark 1:20</a>). The hireling is contrasted with the shepherd. The protector of a flock, who, though, not a thief, or robber, or alien, yet has no unselfish regard for the sheep, is guilty of cowardice, and his shameless flight from danger may do as much harm to the flock as the thief or robber. Godet would, at all events at first, limit the reference to the priestly party, who ought to have had more courage and real care for the sheep, but were utterly unable to bear the brunt of assault from Sanhedrin and Pharisees. The latter represent, as he thinks, the ravening "wolf." But surely all who have merely mercenary or selfish motives in their treatment of souls, and who flee at the approach of danger or death, are here held up to grievous condemnation. All who proclaim themselves to be "the door of the sheep," who, independently of Christ, and without the animating breath of the Divine Spirit, are considering themselves rather than the flock which they profess to instruct and protect, are the hirelings here denounced. In the hour of real peril they turn and flee. "Whose own the sheep are not." They do not seek the destruction of the flock which is not theirs, but they neglect and forsake when they should be faithful unto death. They have not identified themselves with the object of their professed care. The <span class="accented">wolf</span> is the deadly power over seeking the destruction of the soul, and even compassing it; it is the metaphor for every sort of power opposed to Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-3.htm">Luke 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth</span> (them). "The seizing and scattering" shows how these hostile powers not only devastate, but destroy; not only crush individuals, but ruin Churches. The sheep do not belong to a hireling, as they do to a shepherd. No living bond of common interest links them to each other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-13.htm">John 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - (<span class="cmt_word">The hireling</span> <span class="cmt_word">fleeth) because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep</span>. He only cares for himself. He is no match for the wolf of temptation, or disease, or death, lie wants to reap the personal advantage of his temporary office, and, if his own interests are imperiled, he can leave them to any other hireling, or to the wolf. Melancholy picture this of much deserted duty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">I am the good shepherd, and know my <i>sheep</i>, and am known of mine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The Lord resumes: <span class="cmt_word">I am the good Shepherd</span>. He now makes his discourse more explicit. He almost drops the allegory, and merely adopts the sacred metaphor. His self-revelation becomes more full of promise and suggestion for all time. He takes up one of the characteristics of the shepherd which discriminated him from "hireling," "thief," or "robber." <span class="cmt_word">And I know mine own, and my</span> <span class="cmt_word">own know me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father.</span> This more accurate text, translation, and punctuation of the Revised Version brings into living comparison the mutual knowledge of Christ and his own sheep, with the mutual knowledge of Christ and the Father. Christ's personal knowledge of his people is that which comes into their religious consciousness. They know his knowledge of them. They know him to be what he is - to be their Lord God, as they realize his personal recognition and care. The one involves the other (see <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). The particle of transition is more than a mere illustration (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> is more than <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> introduces not infrequently an explanation, sometimes a causal consideration, or an illustration which accounts for the previous statement; see <a href="../../par/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21, 23</a>). The knowledge which the sheep have of the Shepherd corresponds with the Son's knowledge of the Father, and the Shepherd's knowledge of the sheep answers to the Father's knowledge of the Son; but more than this, the relation of the Son to the Father, thus expressed, is the real ground of the Divine intimacies between the sheep and the Shepherd (cf. <a href="../../par/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>). Then the Lord repeats and renews the solemn statement made at the commencement of the sentence, And I lay down my life for the sheep. Such knowledge of the peril of "his  own" involves him in sacrifice. Whereas in ver. 11 this is attributed to the "good Shepherd," now he drops the first part of the figure, and says, "I am laying down my life."

"Other sheep I have." Though they have never as yet heard his voice, they are his. His relation with them is personal and direct and spiritual, not dictated or conditioned by "the fold." They will hear his voice. We in vain ask the question, "When?" He alone can answer it. Many a Cornelius in every nation is accepted by him (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-27.htm">Acts 17:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>). But the passage contemplates a wider application: "Them also I must bring, or lead, among my own." They are scattered abroad now, but eternal Love, by assuming Shepherd-wise relations with them, determines not to bring them to one place or enclosure - to express such a thought we should have had, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>) or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Westcott) - but to bring them into personal relations with himself. <span class="cmt_word">They shall become one flock, one Shepherd</span>. The false English translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, viz. "fold," should be specially noticed. If our Lord had meant to convey the idea of the rigid enclosure into which all the scattered sheep should be gathered, he would have used the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is, however, studiously chosen. The error has done grievous injury. There is no variation of the Greek text, or in the earliest versions. It came through the Vulgate <span class="accented">ovile</span> into Wickliffe's Version, and into many other European versions. The Old Latin Versions were correct, but Jerome led the way into the inaccurate translation. Tyndale perceived its true meaning, and Luther beautifully preserved the play upon the words. Coverdale, in his own Bible (1535), followed Tyndale; but in 1539, "the Great Bible" followed the Vulgate (Westcott). When naturalized, it sustained the false and growing pretension that outside the one "fold" of the visible Church the good Shepherd was not ready with his care and <span class="accented">love</span> (see for the only adequate translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where the Authorized Version has correctly rendered it "flock"). Christ, on other occasions, carefully warned his disciples against such narrowness, and here he declares that the sheep, independently of the fold or folds, may yet form one great <span class="accented">flock</span>, under <span class="accented">one Shepherd</span>. When he described himself as the <span class="accented">Door</span>, he was, as we have seen, careful to speak of himself as "Door of the <span class="accented">sheep</span>," and not as the Door into the <span class="accented">fold</span>. He laid down his life in order to break down the partition between Jew and Gentile (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>), between God and man, and between man and man. "In Christ Jesus there is neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female, bond nor free." There may be many folds. Different nations, ages, times, and seasons may cause variations in these; but there is but one flock under the watchful guardianship of one Shepherd.

The "I" and "me" refer to the incarnate Son, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Divine-human Personality of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father loveth me, <span class="accented">because</span>, not merely <span class="accented">that I lay down my life</span>, for such might be the consequence of helplessness in the presence of victorious and desperate foes. The love which merely "laid down life" would be a Buddha-like self-sacrifice, producing certain moral effects upon the minds of the onlookers, and revealing a large and loving sense of the need of others. Yet in such expression of his sacrificial love he would have relinquished his undertaking. There would have been no more that he could do for his flock, this Shepherd-functions would, in the consummating act, cease, he would be a beautiful Memory, not a living Energy; a glorious Example, not the Author of eternal salvation. He would cease to be the great Shepherd of the sheep. Now the Father's love contemplated more than this, viz. the Lord's own purpose to <span class="accented">take up again that life</span> which he was prepared voluntarily to lay down for the sheep. Thus he would indeed die, that he might be more of a Shepherd to them than he had ever been before. How otherwise would he personally bring the other sheep into his flock, or be known of them, as the Father was known by him? Christ declares that after his death he would still exercise royal rights, be as much a Divine-human Personality as ever. Christ, as a sinless Man, the sinless One, <span class="accented">might</span> indeed, after the victory over the tempter in the wilderness, or from the Mount of Transfiguration, have returned to the spiritual world without accomplishing an exodus on Golgotha, but he chose, he willed, to lay down his life. Having done this much, he might have joined the great majority, and been their Head and Chief, and left his work to be commented on by others. But such a consummation would have fallen far short of the true and sufficing object of the Father's <span class="accented">love</span>. Christ declares that the very end of his death was his resurrection from death. In retaking his life, he is able to continue, on perfectly different terms, the shepherding of his people he becomes in the highest sense, the great Shepherd, the good Shepherd, the archetypal, and the veritable Shepherd of the flock of God.

I am <span class="accented">laying it down</span>, not in consequence of my impotence before the powers of darkness, but "from myself." This proceeding is in perfect harmony with the will of God the Father; but it is Christ's free act notwithstanding, and of all things the most worthy of the Father's love (cf. here <a href="../../par/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>, which appears at first to be in contradiction with the statement of this verse; but the closing words of the verse rectify the impression; see also <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>). Christ justifies his extraordinary claim to lay down and after his death (retaining then the full possession of his Personality), to reassume the life which for a while, in submission to the doom on human nature, he had resolved to sacrifice, he says, I have (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">right</span> - or, <span class="accented">power</span> and <span class="accented">authority</span> combined - <span class="cmt_word">to lay it down, and right to take it again.

The Divine purpose was realized in his perfect freedom and his perfect and absolute fulfillment of the Father's will. The narrative of the agony in the garden, given by the synoptists, confirms the blending of his own freedom with the Divine order; but the language of this Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>), and Matthew 19:11), and the best researches into what is called "the physical cause of the death of Christ" (see Dr. Stroud's valuable work on that subject), all confirm the voluntary nature of our Lord's suffering and death. "To cover this incomparable privilege with a veil of humility, he thought good to call it a command. The Father's mandate was, Thou shalt die or not die, thou shalt rise again or <span class="accented">not</span> rise again, according to the free promptings of thy love" (Godet). It was, however, the Father's appointment that Christ should freely exercise this stupendous consequence of his perfect obedience. So that all the assurances that God raised him from the dead are confirmed by the mode in which he speaks of his Divine right.

The paragraph is pregnant with meaning, arising from the place, the time, and the action of the Jews. It contains the discrimination between the Jews and those who were in spiritual union with himself, viz. his sheep. Then follow the characteristics and privileges of his sheep, which lead up to the climax in which he risks the deadly animosity of his hearers, by claiming identity of saving power with the Father. tic accounts for this by asserting what is expressive of positive consubstantiality with the Father. On any exegesis, this solemn announcement is a stupendous assumption of personal dignity, and was regarded by his hearers as blasphemous madness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>, <span class="cmt_word">the Feast of Dedication</span> (the <span class="accented">enkainia</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was</span> (celebrated) <span class="cmt_word">in Jerusalem</span>. This feast is not elsewhere noticed in the New Testament. The account of its origin is found in 1 Macc. 4:36, etc.; 2 Macc. 10:1 - 8; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:07. 7. <span class="cmt_word">And it was winter</span>. It was held on the 25th of Chisleu, which, in A.D. , would correspond with the 19th of December, in commemoration of the "renewal," reconsecration, of the temple by Judas Maccabaeus after the gross profanation of it by Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Macc. 1:20-60 1 Macc. 4:36-57). It occupied eight days, was distinguished by illumination of the city and temple and of other places throughout the land, and hence was called the "Feast of Lights." Many interesting peculiarities of this feast are detailed in Edersheim's 'Life of Jesus,' 2:228, etc. One feature was the increase night by night of the number of lights which commemorated the restoration of the temple. All fasting and public mourning were prohibited (see 'Moed. K.,' 3:9). The high enthusiasm of the people made them long for deliverance from the Roman yoke. The Jews would probably have eagerly accepted Jesus as Messiah if he had been ready to take up the <span class="accented">role</span> of a political leader. Doubtless he was the Christ of the Hebrew prophecies, and in his own human consciousness his high position swelled his loftiest thought; but he was not the Christ of their Jewish expectation.

It was associated with the grandest events in their national history; for it was reared on the substructions of Solomon's temple, which even to the present day are intact (Robinson's 'Palestine,' 1:289; Palestine Exploration Society's Reports; 'Recovery of Jerusalem,' frontispiece, pp. 17, 226, 309-319). The Lord walked there because it was winter, and wintry weather. This reveals a little touch of the hand of an eye-witness. We need not ask for any more transcendental explanation. The note of time, moreover, implies that two months had elapsed since the Feast of Tabernacles. Wieseler calculates that the Feast of Tabernacles closed on October 19, and the Feast of Dedication began on December 20, and, if so, time is left for a portion of the Galilaean ministry cited in <a href="../../par/luke/10.htm">Luke 10</a>. - 13. <a href="../../par/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9-13</a> shows that the time referred to was after a period of heavy rain, and may account for Jesus walking in the shelter of the portico.

They had heard his parables, and say, "Let him drop all reserve, and deliver himself in categoric form." Archdeacon Watkins has well recalled the various utterances which fell on the more susceptible of the Jerusalemites. This was the Feast of Lights, and has he not called himself the Light of the world? This was a feast commemorative of freedom from the Syrian yoke, and had he not said, "If the Son set you free, ye shall be free indeed"? ' This was the Feast of the Purification of the Temple; had not his first act been a cleansing of the courts of the temple? We cannot wonder at the summons and challenge of the people.

Meyer, however, translates this differently; he supposes the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to refer to the Father "a something greater, a greater potence." Westcott and Hort prefer the reading with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; and Westcott translates, <span class="accented">That which my Father has given me is greater than all</span>, and regards it as a reference to the sheep as a collective unity. The internal reasons compel Luthardt, Godet, and Lange to fall back on T.R., and surely the extraordinary strain of the meaning justifies them. Our Lord would sustain with even stronger assurance the safety of his sheep. The Father's gift to himself, the Father's own eternal love and power, the Divine omnipotence of the Lord God himself, is pledged to their security. "My hand" becomes "my Father's hand." He seems to say, "If you question my capacity, you need not question his power. Sacrilegious violence may apparently nail my hands to the cross; the sword may awake against Jehovah's Shepherd. But none can outwit, surprise, crucify, conquer, my Father, none can invalidate his care."

As Augustine and Bengel have said, the first clause is incompatible with Sabellianism, and the second clause with Arianism. The Lord is conscious of his own Personality as distinct from that of the Father, and yet he asserts a fundamental unity. But what kind of unity is it? Is it a unity of wish, emotion, sentiment, only? On the contrary, it is a oneness of redemptive power. The Divine activity of the Father's eternal love did not come to any arrest or pause when he gave the sheep to the Son, but with its irresistible might is present in the "hand" of Jesus (<span class="accented">no one</span> "can," not no one "shall"). Therefore the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, the one reality, if it does not express actual unity of essence, involves it. Some have endeavored to minimize the force of this remarkable statement by comparing it with <a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>, where Jesus said believers are "to be in us," and "to be one, even as we are one," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to have the same kind of relation with one another (being a collective unity) as the Father and Son sustain towards each other, "I in them, thou in me, that they may be perfected [reach their <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by being blended] into one;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. into one Divine personality by my indwelling. Now, it is nowhere there said that believers and the Father are one, but such a statement is scrupulously avoided. Numerous attempts have been made to escape from the stupendous assumption of this unity of power and essence with the Father. The whole gist of the assertion reveals the most overwhelming self-consciousness. The Lord declares that he can bestow eternal life and blessedness upon those who stand in close living relation with himself, and between whom and himself there is mutual recognition and the interchanges of love and trust. He bases the claim on the fact that the Father's hands are behind his, and that the Father's eternal power and Godhead sustain his mediatorial functions and, more than all, that the Father's Personality and his own Personality are merged in one essence and entity. If be merely meant to imply moral and spiritual union with the Father, or completeness of revelation of the Divine mind, why should the utterance have provoked such fierce resentment?

The Jews felt the force of this indignant reproach, and would not admit that his Divine and goodly work was without meaning to them. It was, however, a melancholy reality that his beneficent work had roused their malice into fiercer activity, but they credit themselves with a higher and a doctrinal motive and with a jealousy for the honor of God. They charge him with blasphemy, and the charge is reiterated before Pilate (<a href="../../par/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>). The Jews were in one sense right. He had declared his essential unity with the Father; he had "made himself, represented himself (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-53.htm">John 8:53</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>), as equal with God."

"Good works" by the score were no vindication of one who dishonored the Name of God by claiming equality with him.

To stand in close relation with the theocracy was to be covered with its glory. He seems to force upon them thus a host of similar blendings of the Divine and human in the age-long preparation for himself, and to free all these from the suspicion of blasphemy. The Hebrew thought was really calculated to prepare the world for this high intercommunion, not to abolish it. Judaism, rabbinism, had widened the chasm between God and man. Christ came to fill up the chasm; nay more, to show the Divine and human in living, indissoluble union.

A fine testimony to the confidence which our Lord exercised in the Holy Scripture. He was accustomed to educe principles of life from its inward structure, from its concealed framework, from its underlying verities. The very method adopted by Jesus on this occasion revealed the fact that both he and his biographer were born Jews. These tyrannical judges were "to die like men," yet, since "the Word of God came to them," there was a sense in which even they, without blasphemous assumptions, might receive the title of <span class="accented">elohim</span>.

He was destined, or designated, or appointed, and then sent to do this sublime deed of redemption. Unlike those to whom the eternal Logos came, conferring thereby honorific titles, and calling them to occasional and alas! His discharged duties, he was the eternal Word himself, and he was moreover (as those old judges (lid) "to die like men," to lay down that life in order that he might take it again; consequently, he asks, with sublime self-consciousness, "Say ye of him, thus consecrated, <span class="cmt_word">Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am Son of God</span>?" It is remarkable that Christ should, instead of repeating the phrase, "I and the Father are one" - <span class="accented">one</span> as we have seen, in power and purpose and attribute - imply that in that former saying he had but told them he was "Son of God," in a sense to which the old Hebrew kings, notwithstanding their theocratic symbolism and mysterious names of honor, could not aspire. This is clearly a bold utterance of the Messianic dignity (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 20</a>). The fact that he continually treated the two ideas of Father and Son as correlative (<a href="../../par/john/8-19.htm">John 8:19</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/9-35.htm">John 9:35-37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-7.htm">John 14:7-13</a>, etc.) makes the one assertion an equivalent of the other. This is a much greater claim than that yielded to the judges of old, and it is a new revelation of the Father and of the Son. Moreover, he showed them that there were many anticipations, foreshadowings of the incarnation of God in their own Scripture. We have an argument from the less to the greater, but one which, while it technically freed him from the charges of blasphemy, revealed the age-long preparation that had been made for the union between the Infinite and finite, between the Creator and creature, between the Father and his child, which was effected in himself. Some may have supposed that in the leveling up of the theocratic adumbrations of the Incarnation, he was virtually relinquishing the uniqueness of his own; but the following words, and the interpretation put on them by his hearers, answer such a charge. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37</a></div><div class="verse">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - "I and the Father are one," and "I am the Son of God." These two mighty utterances are equivalent to the following: "I do the works of my Father." My works are his works, his works are mine. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." The recognition of the Divine is a sign of the regenerated mind, and a test of fitness for a place in Christ's flock (cf. "I know my sheep, and my sheep know me"). The Jews had not recognized the true reciprocal relation between the Father and Son. He had come out from God, and been sent from the Father to produce this impression, to make known the Father by his Sonship; and he had taken steps to convince even unbelieving men of the identity of his nature and Spirit with that of the Father. He is content to rest his claims upon their belief, on the character of his works. He is content to leave the question as to whether he be a blasphemer or one with the Father, a sinner of sinners or Son of God, on the evidence of his works - on the God-like, Father-like character of his entire ministry (cf. ver. 32; <a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span> "If the evidence be insufficient, I acquit you of blame in not taking me at my word. My own words and Person and life <span class="accented">might</span> be enough for you; but if my works are not in perfect harmony with the best you know of the Father, believe me not." Christ's appeal to the reason of his hearers, to the sufficiency of the evidence he had given, would justify unbelief in case of a proved failure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a></div><div class="verse">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father <i>is</i> in me, and I in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if I do</span> - if I am performing the works of my Father, if these acts of healing and helping, of mighty consolation and symbolic grace, are obviously such as you can recognize as the Father's, believe them; learn that much, - it is for your life - and if you make that acquisition, <span class="cmt_word">though ye believe not me</span> - though you do not credit my assertion on my own authority, though you do not take me at once on my own word - <span class="cmt_word">believe the works; you may</span> then take the further step, and both <span class="cmt_word">know and understand</span>, or know broadly and completely, and then learn in details, <span class="cmt_word">that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</span> Between the assertion of ver. 30, "I and my Father are one," and that of this verse, "the works" are introduced - works that are recognized as Divine, "the Father's," but seen and known also to be Christ's own works. Why should they stone him for blasphemy if they have evidence so resistless as this, even if it comes short of proof, that he is absolutely one with the Father? The intuitive perception of the Divine in Christ is the highest and noblest spiritual experience. His word should be, might be, enough; but, suppose it should fail, miracles, "works," come in to link the Divine Personality of the Speaker with the supreme Father. The works may teach them that he is in the Father, and the Father in him. Not by a flash of light, but by growing intellectual conviction, they must come to a conclusion which the great assertion," I and the Father are one," finally confirms.

His escape was facilitated by the strange moral power he could exert to render their assaults upon him vain. They stretched out hands which dropped harmlessly at their side - another confirmation of the solemn statement of ver. 18. There is no need to suppose a miracle, still less to justify the preposterous notion that the body of Jesus was, in John's Gospel, docetic merely (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-30.htm">Luke 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/11-18.htm">Mark 11:18</a>).

There he submitted to baptism, to fasting, and temptation. There he had heard the first testimonies of John. There he had gathered round him his most susceptible and appreciative hearers. There Andrew and Simon, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, came under his mighty spell. There the first intuition of his Messiahship dawned on the noblest of his followers. The entire suggestion, is unquestionably historic. That special scene of our Lord's ministry was indelibly impressed on the memory of the beloved disciple. <span class="accented">The place where John at first baptized</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the place occupied by John before he came to OEnon, and therefore in the district where he delivered his most solemn testimonies to the people, to the Sanhedrin, to the first disciples. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">there he abode</span>. How long, we know not. The repose was soon broken. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41</a></div><div class="verse">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41, 42.</span> - "The posthumous fruit of John's labors" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Many came to him, and they said,</span> one to another, rather than to the Lord, <span class="cmt_word">John indeed did no sign</span>. It was not John's function to work miracles or startle the world with visible proofs of his Divine commission. John stood on the natural sphere, found a place in contemporaneous history, and exerted all his influence by the force of his prophetic word. But as a remarkable confirmation of the whole revelation enacted by the life and deeds of Christ, we read, <span class="cmt_word">But all things that John spake of this Man were true.</span> The testimonies of John were to the effect that Jesus was "mightier" than he - that he was the Son of God, the "Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and with fire," and "<span class="accented">the</span> Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world." The absence of the miraculous nimbus from the record of John's ministry is one of the subsidiary evidences we possess of the supernatural power wielded by our Lord Jesus Christ. John was a historic contemporary of Jesus, whose following survived for some centuries, but not until comparatively recent times did credulity or the mythopceic tendency clothe him in a supernatural glory. He was believed to be the Elijah of the new covenant, but he was not supposed to have gone to heaven, like his prototype. A rumor grew up that Jesus was John raised from the dead, but nothing came of it. There was all the material for a splendid myth, but no evolution of one. The reasoning, therefore, is fair - since Jesus <span class="accented">is</span> reported by <span class="accented">John's disciples</span> to have wrought great signs; these reports are not to be put down to credulity or fiction. The evangelist distinctly asserts that all these testimonies which he had himself recorded in <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>, when followed up by the visible and wonderful presence of the Son of God himself, were held to be true. We need not wonder, then, that <span class="cmt_word">many believed on him there.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
