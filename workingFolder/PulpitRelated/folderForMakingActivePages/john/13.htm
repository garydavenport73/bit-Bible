This supplies a chronological note, which is not exhausted by the mysterious and pathetic act which is described, but embraces the entire communion of soul with his disciples, and with the Father in their presence, detailed in <a href="../../par/john/13.htm">John 13-17</a>. Commentators have differed greatly as to the reference of this phrase - whether to the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, as Kling and Luthardt, or to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as Wieseler and Tholuck; both these interpretations limit the meaning of the passage. Christ's knowledge that his hour was come was not kept from him till that moment, nor was his love to his own disciples limited or qualified by the advent of the Passover. It is far better, with Westcott, Coder, Meyer, and Lange, to take the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, with the principal verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This becomes mere obvious if <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> be taken, as it generally is taken, in Greek, to mean "unto the uttermost," "absolutely" "perfectly." Godet and Lucke add to the idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> here the <span class="accented">manifestation</span>, or <span class="accented">proof</span>, of the intensity and tenderness of the Divine love. Meyer doubts this signification of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>. The whole of the intervening sentence is in apposition with the subject of the sentence. The evangelist was eye-withes of the manner and look of his Lord, and ventured to say what was passing in his mind. He was justified by what followed, and threw back into the spirit of this strange and solemn action the account which the Lord afterwards gave of himself. Throughout the whole passage we detect; the extraordinary blending of Divine and human of which John was the witness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus knowing</span> (as he did know) <span class="cmt_word">that the hour was</span> <span class="cmt_word">come</span> - an hour for which he had been long waiting, and to which frequent reference has been made. The crisis has arrived, the breach with the authorities was final, the disciples themselves were trembling in doubt, the great law had been uttered, the glorification of the Son of man must now be accomplished by departure rather than by longer ministry, by death rather than by universal acclaim - <span class="cmt_word">that</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> here notes the Divine purpose, or what is not infrequently introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "the contemplated result" (see Canon Evans on  "the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament," <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 3, 2nd series) - <span class="cmt_word">he</span>, Jesus, the Son of man, <span class="cmt_word">should depart out of this world</span> (this is one theme of the following discourse, one of its key-notes, <a href="../../par/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>, and many other passages) unto the Father. If so, death was not an ending of life, but a departure to the Father - a coming into closer and more intimate relations and communion with the Father than was possible, even for him, in this sinful and evil world. Frequently the demonstrative pronoun is used to designate this transitory, perilous, sad state of being. Further, Jesus <span class="cmt_word">having loved his own</span>, his very own, whom the Father had given him, <span class="cmt_word">who were</span> and would continue <span class="cmt_word">in the world</span>, and have tribulation there (see <a href="../../par/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-1.htm">John 16:1-4, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11, 14, 18</a>), and all the more so because of his departure and the cessation of his earthly manifestation and ministry. Here the sentence ends with the climacteric expression, <span class="cmt_word">He loved them utterly</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he manifested, and that before the Paschal Lamb should be slain for them, his absolute, extreme, unutterable love. Archdeacon Watkins has made an interesting suggestion, that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> represents, in Greek, the Hebrew idiom of the repetition of the action of the verb; whereas the LXX. often presents this Hebraism in literal Greek, as <a href="../../par/genesis/20-17.htm">Genesis 20:17</a>, yet in <a href="../../par/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a> a similar reduplication is Grecized by the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and that what St. John, a Hebrew writing in Greek, meant by the use of it was simply," He loved them with a fullness of love." This usage is confirmed by <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>, by later Greek and by classical usage. It probably means in <a href="../../par/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a> "at last," but not necessarily so even there. Margin of Revised Version gives "to the uttermost." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, to betray him;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A supper having commenced</span>; or, <span class="accented">being then in progress</span> - without doubt the meal in which our Lord terminated the Old Testament dispensation and introduced the New, and which John discriminates, therefore, from the Passover proper referred to in ver. 1. The evangelist now reverts to the diabolic design which had been injected into the heart of Judas. <span class="cmt_word">The devil having already cast into the heart</span> (of Judas) <span class="cmt_word">that he</span> - Meyer's suggestion that the devil put this design into his own heart, does not lighten the construction, and encumbers the passage with ideas which are foreign to the Bible - (<span class="cmt_word">even</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Judas</span>, (<span class="cmt_word">the son</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of Simon, the Iscariot, should betray him</span>. The idea came from the devil, but the purpose of the devil was not irrevocable. The evangelist looked through his tears of love to the traitor's face as he sat at meat, and felt how the very excess and uttermost and hyperbole of love was reached and scaled by the contact between the treachery of the one and the Divine humiliation of the other. The contrast between these two mental states is one of the most striking antitheses in the Gospel. But how should John know that Judas had already plotted the betrayal of his Master? Hengstenberg makes the wise suggestion that the fourth evangelist was acquainted with the synoptic tradition of the priority of Judas's bargain with the chief priests (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-10.htm">Mark 14:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3-6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span> - a significant hint of the complex wonder of the Lord's Person. John felt at this moment that the consciousness of Jesus was receding into the eternal self-consciousness of the Logos when he thus ventures to speak - <span class="cmt_word">that the Father</span> - in the great act of his generation - <span class="cmt_word">gave</span> <span class="cmt_word">all things into his hands, and that he came forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from God, and was going back</span> (<span class="accented">or, away</span>) to God, in the glory of his incarnation and the mystery of his death and resurrection. The whole of the incarnate ministry of Jesus was a separation, to some extent, from God, just as the close of it, in the death and resurrection, was a return to the glory which he had with the Father before all worlds. We must admit the extraordinary quality of the evangelist's assertion. He here throws back into the majestic manner of the Christ the hints which the subsequent discourse of our Lord must have given him of the Divine greatness which flashed at times from his sacred Person, and conferred a boundless significance on the subsequent act of humiliation. Christ gave the highest proof of his Divine self-consciousness in this display of his condescending love, this voluntary abasement to the lowest place in the household of faith. The use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> twice ever (vers. 1 and 3) is contrasted with the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> of ver. 7. The vast confessions here made are declared to be matters of absolute intuitive knowledge, not the results of long experience. Christ did not "come to know;" he "knew" all these facts about himself. It must not be supposed that this was a theological idea which came into the writer's mind afterwards. St. Paul, in the Epistle to the Philippians (Philippians 2:6-8), had adequately grasped the same thought long before St. John penned this Gospel (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5</span>  - Commentators differ as to the motive which induced our Lord to perform this menial act, to adopt the gesture, girding, and duties of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, to divest himself of his <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> or upper garments, and to appear and veritably to act as a slave. Strauss regards it as a mythical representation of one of our Lord's discourses on humility. Lange, with much pertinence, believes it to correspond to the pain, which he manifested, at the very last Supper, with the unseemly contest for pre-eminence among the apostles (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>, "Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? I am among you as he that serveth"). Others, like Meyer, see no such reference, and require the presence of no such motive. It is remarkable that at such a season this dispute could have arisen at all. I-laving undoubtedly broken out on more than one occasion, our Lord chose the midst of this feast, when we learn from other sources there was such an outbreak, for this emphatic revelation of the royalty of service. Wunsche ('Erl.,' p. 550) says that both "before" and "alter" the Passover festival it was customary, in order to demonstrate the equality and liberty of the guests, to practice mutual interchanges of the ordinary menial service of <span class="accented">hand-washing</span> ('Pesachin,' fol. 108). In this verse every sentence is a distinct picture. <span class="cmt_word">He riseth from the supper, and layeth down his upper garments, and when he had taken a towel, he girded himself</span> (Edersheim and Wunsche both give proof that the Talmud repeatedly Grecizes the word here rendered "towel," <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "linen cloth," by the word <span class="accented">lentith</span> or <span class="accented">alen-tith</span>) after the fashion of the humblest slave; then <span class="cmt_word">he poureth water into the washing-basin</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the article of furniture in the room ("Nihil ministerii omittit," says Grotius. Thus he discharges every part of the duty, while the disciples wonder at the new revelation). <span class="cmt_word">And he began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</span> Westcott refers to the rabbinic commentators on <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>, "<span class="accented">Among</span> men, the slave washes his master, but with God it is not <span class="accented">so</span>." So then the inversion of all human social relations forced on John's mind the deep truth that we are here face to face with the Divine - with the Divine-human. John here strains his words to give some conception of what passed in his own mind when he saw our Lord's face, and witnessed this great revelation of his character. Though this evangelist did not record the "<span class="accented">Transfiguration</span>," there were moments in Christ's history which produced a still pro-founder impression upon him, and in which he veritably saw the glory of the Only Begotten of God in his Master's form. On this occasion the highest conception of his Divine Personality, origin, and destiny, was blended with the deepest descent of the Lord's entire humanity to the level of weakness, pollution, and sin. The greatest manifestation of God was in the revelation of the exceeding limits, the infinite depth, which love could compass. We may see a little farther on what were the special <span class="accented">steps</span> our Lord took to give this sense of love "<span class="accented">to</span> the uttermost" on the part of him to whom all the universe had been entrusted, who had come from, and was going back to, the Father. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel wherewith he was girded.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-6.htm">John 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It cannot be determined with whom our Lord commenced the feet-washing. Some of the older expositors have said it was with Judas. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> might denote that several of the disciples, in awestruck wonder, had submitted without a word, and then (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> resumptive) <span class="cmt_word">he cometh to Simon Peter.</span> But the great bulk of ancient and modern expositors suppose that Peter was the first to whom this great grace was offered. At all events, in his impulsive manner always rushing forwards, and ready to give his Master advice, and to be the mouthpiece of otherwise unuttered feelings, Peter was the first to exclaim, (<span class="cmt_word">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">saith unto</span> <span class="accented">him</span>, and with strong emphasis on the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou wash my feet</span>? The protest was natural. It corresponds with many another scene in Peter's life; as when he said, "<span class="accented">Depart</span> from me; for I am a sinful man," or cried, "That be far from thee," and later on in this chapter, "Why cannot I follow thee now?" or, "I have never eaten anything common or  unclean." This trait in Peter's character is wonderfully accurate, and corresponds with the portraiture of the same man in the synoptic narrative (see Introduction, p. 115.). There is here an analogous blending of reverence and self-will, of outwardness and forwardness - a new illustration of one who would distinguish himself by the greatness of his humility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-7.htm">John 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to him, That which I am doing thou knowest not now</span> - thou hast not absolute knowledge of, thou hast not seen through as yet; <span class="cmt_word">but after these things</span>, afterwards when I shall have completed my present undertaking, thou (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shalt</span> come by clear proof and full discovery and intimate acquaintance to <span class="cmt_word">understand</span>. This is sometimes referred to the subsequent illumination of the Holy Spirit, or even to the higher life of the future world (Luthardt), but the above interpretation is more consonant with the context. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> may (as Westcott suggests) point to the whole manifestation of love as it should complete itself on the cross, and become illumined by the Resurrection and by the gift of the Spirit, when the same mind should be put into Peter that was in Christ Jesus; consequently we may reasonably apply this great word to many of our earthly experiences. God's ways, Christ's government of his Church, and the mystery of our lot, are often so puzzling that we cannot be said to know them objectively or absolutely. We know (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) but in part, and see (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) by means of a mirror (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>); but eventually in the fulness of the Divine manifestation we shall know (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>) completely, subjectively, in the depths of our personal consciousness. <span class="cmt_word">Peter saith to him</span>, with mere emphasis than before, with an intensity of double negative and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not ever wash my feet</span> - "not while eternity lasts." "A praiseworthy modesty," says Calvin, "were it not that with God obedience is better than worship." This vehement, Peter-like burst showed that even yet he had not learned his profound dependence upon his Lord. Exuberant utterance of a love which in its superlative enthusiasm was in danger of severing the relation between his Lord and himself, elicited from Christ a reply which went far Beneath this purely symbolic washing, and gave even to it a moral significance which it had not possessed before. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, If I wash thee</span> (not thy feet) <span class="cmt_word">not, thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">no part with me</span> - no <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, no portion, no share, no communion, no common inheritance with me in the honors and blessings of the kingdom. This may be understood in two ways: either, "If I do not by my grace cleanse you from your defilement, wash you in a deeper sense, in a more abundant and effectual manner than by giving you this practical lesson, there is utter misunderstanding of my relation to you - you have no part nor share with me." And this ver. 11 seems to favor. Hengstenberg strongly defends this view as a reference by Christ to his power on earth to forgive sins, and confer the pure and new nature (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4, 9-11</a>); and this doubtless lies in the solemn tone of the Lord. A refusal to accept the Divine cleansing is the only ground of exclusion from the benefits of the bloodshedding. Still another more obvious meaning arises, "<span class="accented">If</span> you refuse this manifestation of humble love from me, if you put your own pride between yourself and me, if you disdain this act of self-surrender, claiming to understand me and our mutual relations better than I, you have no part with me. This is a symbol of my love to you, and of what is to be your love to one another (ver. 15); if you refuse to accept it from me, you will then have no part with me in the manifestation of the spirit of self-sacrificing love which I have come to inaugurate." Peter must learn the beauty and glory of service for the sake of others; and if he were unable to understand and accept this act of love, he must separate himself from all share in the Master's work. This truth dawned upon him, but only in part, and it led to the extraordinary revulsion of feeling which followed.

Once more he will go before and give advice to his Master. The very same Peter who drew the sword in Gethsemane and then fled, who went to the high priest's palace and then denied his Lord; the very same Peter who rushed into the water anal then cried, "Lord, save me, I perish," who cried, even on the Mount of Transfiguration, "Let us build three tabernacles;" and when our Lord spoke of his cross said, "This shall not be done unto thee;" - the same Simon Peter now <span class="cmt_word">said to him</span>, "If it comes to the primal experience of being washed by thee in thine unutterable love, if there be any question of part and share with thee in thy work, I will (cf. ver. 37) go with thee to prison and to death, then, blessed <span class="cmt_word">Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all my uncovered body; seeing that my power of thinking and all my capacity for service alike need cleansing." Peter not unreasonably felt the weakness and corruption of his nature, and cried out, as we all are often disposed to do, for renewal and sanctification of every faculty and energy of his being. In this he showed a lack of realization of the new world into which grace had brought him, and once more needed correction. Chrysostom says, "In his deprecation be was vehement, in his yielding more vehement, but both came from his love." But even here we see the same eagerness to go beyond the Lord, and dictate the course to be pursued. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him</span>.

They had been washed from the defilement of their old nature, they had undergone a thorough moral and spiritual change, by moral union with Christ. They were reconciled and cleansed; they therefore did not need a fundamental change to be wrought daily in head, hands, and life. Just as a man who had thoroughly bathed only requires the removal of the soil contracted in the daily walk; so a regenerated and forgiven man is clean, and, like Peter, should not need, being <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, more than the foot-cleansing which Christ in Divine condescension had then granted. It was inevitable that some of the Fathers (Augustine, Theodore) and many modern expositors (Hengstenberg, Godet, and Wordsworth) should see here a reference to baptism, and speak of Peter's having overlooked the grace of his baptism. When it is remembered, however, that nothing but John's "baptism unto repentance" had been administered to the disciples, and that this cleansing is, in <a href="../../par/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>, distinctly referred to the <span class="accented">word</span> of Christ, it is a very unnecessary trifling with the text to find in this <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> baptism or any sacramental or symbolic act. Lampe and Cocceius, in rendering <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, substitute for baptism, the regeneration of the Spirit, and treat the washing of the feet as equivalent to the daily forgiveness of sins of infirmity. Archdeacon Farrar, 'Early Days of Christianity,' vol. 1. p. 126, suggests that this intensely interesting scene may account for Simon Peter's picturesque expression (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), wherein he enjoins on Christians to "tie on humility like a dress fastened with knots;" and also for the apostle's "insight into the true meaning of baptism, as being, not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God." <span class="cmt_word">And ye are clean</span>; and therefore these words and this principle apply to you. Dr. Westcott finds in this phrase a reference to the purity of the <span class="accented">visible</span> Church, notwithstanding, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the presence of Judas in the group; but the exception itself which follows shows that the Lord did not regard Judas as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The suggestion of the passage is precisely contrary to that so often drawn. <span class="cmt_word">But not all</span>. This reference to Judas may have been one more warning to the man who was plotting against his Master's life.

John certainly calls attention to the Lord's knowledge of the secret of Judas, and justifies thus his Divine prerogative. That Strauss, Hilgenfeld, and others should see here an innuendo against Peter, and the charge against Peter of advocating a kind of Ebionitie daily ablution of the whole body, is willful and uncalled for.

At this supreme moment he does not repudiate this high function, nor abate any of his lofty claims. He was most obviously the highest in his condescending love. He had given no more amazing proof of the originality and supremacy of his nature than this inversion of all ordinary relations. So I AM - more, indeed, than "the Teacher," "the Savior," more than "the Master," as Peter said on a memorable occasion, "God was with him," and he was Immanuel - "God with us," and "Lord of all" (<a href="../../par/acts/10-37.htm">Acts 10:37, 38</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14</a></div><div class="verse">If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet; ye ought also to wash one another's feet: for I have given</span> <span class="cmt_word">you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, "as," "like as," was used by our Lord rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span>, "that which." The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> shows that he had set before his disciples a parallel, an example, a symbolic type of the service they were to render to one another, and was not establishing a custom or exact ordinance. The washing of the feet was an Oriental custom of great antiquity as a mark of hospitality (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; Abigail, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>; see also <a href="../../par/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38, 44</a>). In <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a> there is trace of such a custom of Christian hospitality. Considering the ease with which the Church has established a ceremonial from an isolated text, it is remarkable that no more literal use has been made of this injunction. However, <span class="accented">Maundy Thursday</span>, a name derived from <span class="accented">Dies mandati</span>, was celebrated as the day on which this great command, or that contained in ver. 34, was <span class="accented">given - Mandatum novum do vobis - and</span> the feet of the newly baptized were washed. The endeavor to make Augustine the authority for this religious practice is doubtful; but the Council of Toledo (A.D. 694) mentions this particular day as that on which it was appropriate. In the early Gallican Church there was such a ritual, and the forms of <span class="accented">pedilavium</span> observed are to be read in early Gothic and Galliean missals. Bernard of Clairvaux tried to convert the ceremony into a sacrament, but without success. And it would seem that some effort was made to introduce it into Spain. "In 1530, Wolsey washed, wiped, and kissed the feet of fifty-nine poor men at Peterborough. The practice was continued by English sovereigns till the reign of James II." (Westcott). No traces of it are to be found in the Ambrosian ritual, but the preservation of the custom is found now in the Russian imperial palace, in the ceremonies of the holy week at Rome, and in the palaces of Vienna, Madrid,Munich. The practice was for a time retained by the United Brethren and Mennonites, and the Tunkers of Philadelphia (see 'Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' vol. 1. arts. "Baptism," &sect;&sect; 34, 67, and "Maundy Thursday;" Herzog., 'Encyc.,' art. "Fusswaschung," by H. Merz; and Schaff's 'Herzog.,' art. "Tunkers"). The Church has for the most part looked below the mere form to the real substance of the Lord's teaching, and only thus can we appreciate it adequately. The very injunction would be an inadequate, burdensome one where the feet are covered, and would become impossible and valueless in the Northern and Western world. The service demanded is the self-forgetting ministry of love, which places the interests of self behind and below those of others. Nothing is more theoretically easy and acceptable than this principle, but nothing more difficult of accomplishment. This sentence of our Lord is a noble illustration of the method in which a great principle is made by him the basis of a small duly (cf. Paul's vindication of his own truthfulness and freedom from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17-20</a>; he based it on God's own faithfulness to promise).

Therefore if I, your Lord and Teacher, have set forth this principle of self-abnegating service, <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> should ye in love serve one another, the greatest should render even menial service to the humblest; he that would be first to him that is the last, and each to all. This is one of the essential marks, and ever will be, of the mind that was in Christ Jesus (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23, 24</a>, where an analogous phrase justifies the disciples in expecting and fleeing from persecution - a step in which they would simply be following their Lord's example; cf. a very different use of the proverb in <a href="../../par/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>, where it is used to warn a blind man from assuming the office of a guide, and the resemblance of the character, etc., between the Teacher and disciple).

The sublime principle by itself may be something, but if it be never put into practice, the last great beatitude is forfeited.

This paragraph draws the circle of his cleansed ones, of those who accept him as Master and Lord in the fullest sense, more closely (at) out him.

Emphasis must be laid upon the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It refers to Christ's choice of apostles, not to the eternal election to salvation. This interpretation corresponds more closely with the text, though it savors of a fatalism foreign to the Scripture. There is, however, a true sense in which the evil-disposed man is so placed that, if he will sin, he must sin along certain well-defined lines. The forty-first psalm, from which the quotation is made, is not strictly Messianic; it is descriptive of the ideal Sufferer, the holy but outraged man, whose melancholy condition is sure to be characterized by treachery among his familiar friends. Christ implies that, if he were to fulfill this portraiture, then this bitter dreg would be put into his cup; and so he humanly made this choice, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps which in their tenderness of love might have saved Judas from the worst, but which were really part of a Divine plan which would vindicate his own foresight and the method of Divine government. A full understanding of the formula in Matthew and John, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc0;&#x1fbe;</span>, will save us from putting into these words a hopeless fatalism. Notice that the LXX. reads this passage differently, and is not so closely allied to the Hebrew: "He that eateth my leaves hath magnified against me his surreptitious despite, his tricky antagonism." Great beauty is given to the passage by the R.T. <span class="accented">you</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, for it suggests the idea that Christ was the real Host of the twelve, the Father and Provider of his family. Christ must be regarded as the Father and Host of the entire group of guests, and the treacherous treatment of a host throughout the East is regarded as a sign of peculiar obduracy.

Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>) shows that at this very moment Judas had so far given way to his avarice, impatience, disappointment, and innate pride and selfishness, as to be simply seeking his opportunity to betray his Master in the absence of the multitude. He had his price; he was meditating treachery. Granting the mixture of motive which may have agitated him, we condemn the pleading of numerous modern writers, who almost extenuate his malice and represent him as victim of the violent vulgar passion of the multitude for a triumphant secular Messiah. Every touch or stroke in the evangelic narrative shows how utterly Impervious to goodness the traitor really was; and John gives us a further hint, in addition to that supplied by the synoptists, as to the very commencement of the agony, the details of which they prolong into the night. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was troubled in the spirit</span> (cf. notes on John 11:33). This is one of the strongest expressions used of the sorrows of Christ; the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span> even was deeper down in his nature than what is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, of Matthew. The distress penetrated from "body" to "soul," and then to inmost "spirit." The Lord was terribly perturbed, not merely with approaching agony aggravated by treachery and desertion, but by the contrast between his love and the issue, between an apostle and his doom. <span class="cmt_word">And he testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you</span>. A close specification of coming events takes the place of the more vague utterances of vers. 17-19. <span class="cmt_word">One of</span> <span class="cmt_word">you shall betray me</span>. The synoptic account introduces the vivid scene of humble and heart-.rending inquiry, "Lord, is it I?" to which the reply was made, "The one that dippeth his hand in the dish with me shall betray me," followed by a still more awful warning, and imprecation calling the self-consciously guilty man to hesitate, to pause for his own sake (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a>). And, further, we learn that Judas received the answer, unheard by his fellow-disciples that it was he who was in this imminent danger. This scene, however, was so impressive to the majority that the synoptic tradition failed to record a briefer side-scene, of which John was the principal witness, and which he here describes. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples</span> (<span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>) <span class="cmt_word">were gazing on one another, being in perplexity concerning whom he spake</span>. They were looking on in mute or whispering amazement and tribulation upon one another, being in sore bewilderment (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), but as yet they did not suspect Judas. <span class="cmt_word">There was lying</span>, says our text, reclining at the table, <span class="cmt_word">in the bosom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>) - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "against the breast" - <span class="cmt_word">one of his disciples whom Jesus loved.</span> Observe, this sacred designation occurs in <a href="../../par/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20</a>. In <a href="../../par/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a> it is "the other disciple whom Jesus <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">amabat</span>, implying that the love of Jesus was not confined to John, but embraced Peter also; whereas <span class="accented">here</span> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, the higher love of respect and affection, <span class="accented">diligebat</span>. We can have no doubt, from the enumeration of the group in <a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>, etc., that it is one of Zebedee's sons. Now one of these, James, as we learn from the narrative of <a href="../../par/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, soon passed away. The author of the Fourth Gospel does undoubtedly mean to refer to John, and to represent the disciple <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> as no other than himself. The <span class="accented">attitude</span> so carefully described had been adopted by the Jews at table. It shows that John was seated, or was reclining, next to Jesus on his right, and therefore could, more easily than his next companion on the left, have sought and received an answer from the Lord. Whether this was Peter or Judas does not appear certain. Edersheim has represented Peter's place as on the opposite side of the horseshoe table. Words from that distance could have been overheard by all. At the celebration of the Passover, the guests were accustomed originally to <span class="accented">stand</span>; but after the Captivity the custom fell into desuetude.

Edersheim also speaks of the <span class="accented">left</span> side as the place of honor, but assigns no adequate reason for such a violation of universal usage and metaphor. The natural impetuosity of Peter would have induced him, if he had been so near, to have asked the question himself. It is more probable that Judas himself was there, judging from the language of <a href="../../par/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>, and from the act which follows. Either with T.R., <span class="cmt_word">He spake to him, to ask who it might be</span>; <span class="cmt_word">or, saith, Tell</span> (<span class="cmt_word">us</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who it is concerning whom he speaks</span>; as though Peter had rushed to the conclusion that John knew.

The <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the morsel of meat or bread dipped into the charoseth, a mead of wine and fruit used at the Paschal meal. The usage is illustrated by the LXX. version of <a href="../../par/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a> and <a href="../../par/job/31-17.htm">Job 31:17</a>. In the New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> is used for distribution of food, <a href="../../par/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. The act of Jesus was almost contemporaneous with the "Thou sayest it" of the synoptists It was twofold in meaning, explaining to John what he wished to know fur Peter's sake, and giving Judas one more gracious chance to repent and believe in the Divinity of love rather than that of display, power, and pomp. Judas had been dipping his hand into the same dish with his Master, eating his bread. Instead of resenting such effrontery the blessed Lord gave him in pity the last opportunity to escape, he puts the morsel sopped in the acid wine, the bread of fellowship, into his very lips, and the miscreant received it. The name of Judas, and of his father, and of the place cursed by being his birthplace, are once more introduced at length (cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-71.htm">John 6:71</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a></div><div class="verse">And after the sop Satan entered into him.

How could this be known? The evangelist clearly saw what he thus described - he saw the malign and unrelenting expression on Judas's face; he suspected that some devilish plot was hatched, some hideous purpose finally formed. It is the evangelist's way of saying what he personally saw and afterwards concluded. Up to that moment of supreme forbearance, the character was not irretrievably damned, but <span class="accented">now</span> he had sinned against knowledge and love, and even Jesus gives him up. "It were better for him that he had never been born." There is no more awful or tragic touch in the whole narrative, nor any more symbolic of the curse which the corrupt heart can make and bring down upon itself out of the greatest blessing. There is no advantage in trying to determine the amount of figurative sense conveyed by the expression, "Satan entered." The ethical state consequent either upon the sop or the devil is clear enough. The moment when it was induced is signalized in this tragedy. The vehement effort which the traitor must have made to resist all gracious influences opened the way for the powers of hell and darkness to take possession of him. He strengthened himself to do evil. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said to him, That thou doest, do quickly.</span> Questions have been raised as to the sentence - whether it was a solemn command or a permission at once to carry out the purpose that was in his heart (as Grotius, Kuinoel, and others suppose); but Meyer here is more penetrative (so Moulton): "Jesus (as a man) actually wishes to surmount as soon as possible the last crisis of his fate now determined for him." Jameson ('Profound Problems in Theology and Philosophy') urges that it was the prolongation of the struggle which was the bitterest element in Christ's sufferings. The decision at which he had arrived brooked no longer delay. As if he had said, "If you have any manhood in you, and you are not altogether incarnate daemon, make haste, let me remain no longer in suspense; carry out the purpose now and at once." Ambrose, Lucke, Tholuck, suggest that he meant to separate Judas from the eleven, and be rid of his presence. His removal from the group is undoubtedly the condition of our Lord's highest revelations of himself.

It is arbitrary for Keim to say that John <span class="accented">must</span> have known. The whole of this "aside" was the work of a moment. <span class="cmt_word">For certain of them were supposing, because Judas held the purse</span> - or, <span class="accented">box</span> (see note, <a href="../../par/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to him; Buy the things we have need of for the feast</span>; <span class="cmt_word">or</span>, (he spake) <span class="cmt_word">in order that he should give something to the poor</span>. (See Introduction, p. 92, for an explanation of this passage, and the use that has been made of it to settle the question of the day of our Lord's death.) If the great feast of the Jews was to be held on the following day, and this was the 13-14th of Nisan, this advice would be perfectly comprehensible, whereas, if it was the 14-15th when Jesus and also all the Jews were celebrating the Passover, the purchase of any articles would have been contrary to law; and on both grounds the conclusion is drawn that this was the evening of the 13-14tb, and that the Paschal meal had certainly been anticipated by Jesus; but this is not absolutely conclusive, because, even though this were the Passover meal, it is certain that further sacrifices, called "Passovers," were consumed on the great day of unleavened bread that followed the Paschal meal, and it is not perfectly certain what was the custom of the Jews with reference to purchase. Talmudic authorities may be quoted both ways; and a large number of distinguished commentators ( Hengstenberg, Tholuck, Lange, M'Clellan) take the latter view, harmonizing John with the synoptists; but considering all the other difficulties that arise, Meyer, Godet, and Westcott take the former view. The supposition of a gift to the poor from the little stock is very suggestive of the almsgiving spirit that had pervaded all the habits of disciples taught by Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/john/12-5.htm">John 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hengstenberg urges that the night of the Passover was that above all others on which the poor needed help to rejoice before the Lord.

The immediate departure of Judas when he had taken the sop is compatible with all the context - a horror of the shadow of death falls on the tragic scene. He at least passes out into the outer darkness, apt symbol of his soul and of his deed. Hengstenberg imagines the Lord's Supper to have followed the previous words, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> must be interpreted with some laxity, leaving time for the sacred meal to have been instituted and the solemn song to have been sung. It is difficult to say where the Eucharistic service is to be introduced, and every possible suggestion has been made. The statement of <a href="../../par/luke/22-21.htm">Luke 22:21, 22</a> makes it probable that the traitor was present at it. And all the synoptists make the indication of the traitor follow the institution of the Eucharist, and two of them place it on the very way to the garden of Gethsemane. Bengel, in harmony with his chronological scheme, supposes that the traitor went out and returned. According to Keim, the Eucharistic meal may be supposed to be introduced at the close of <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14</a>. and before the discourse on the vine; but that discourse follows a summons of Jesus to his disciples to leave the upper chamber. And every attempt to find a place for it in the midst of the valedictory discourse is unsatisfactory (see these amply discussed in Godet, Lucke, Meyer). Thus Paulus, etc., place it after ver. 30. Lucke and Meyer, between vers. 33 and 34; but Peter's question looks back to ver. 33, allowing no such break. Neander and Ebrard place after ver. 32. Tholuck, after ver. 34, Lange identifies it with the new commandment; and Bengel makes the discourse down to <a href="../../par/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a> precede Christ's journey to Jerusalem to keep the Passover, so that no clashing takes place. I think that the simplest solution of the difficulty is to put it at the commencement of the feast, and in the folds as it were of the sentence in <a href="../../par/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>, which tells us that Jesus loved his disciples to the uttermost (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The endeavor made by Strauss, to argue from the silence of the fourth evangelist that he knew nothing of the institution of the Eucharist, is a great exaggeration. The synoptic tradition must, <span class="accented">ex hypothesi</span> of the late authorship of the Gospel, be well known to the author, and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-33.htm">1 Corinthians 11:33</a>, etc., was ample proof of its historic basis. There was, in the entire representation of this Gospel, an intense perception of the inner meaning of the Eucharist, and of the new covenant and commandment based on the assumption of the Passion and death of the incarnate God; so that instead of describing the ceremonial, he expounds its ideas (see Introduction, pp. 105, 106.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver, 31</span> - <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>. - 3. THE VALEDICTORY DISCOURSES OF THE LORD. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-33.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The glorification of the Son of man, and of the Father in the Son</span>. With ver. 31 the solemn valedictory discourse of our Lord commences - a veritable <span class="accented">evangelium in evangelio</span>, and by the aid of which we come more closely to the heart of Jesus. "Here," as Olshausen says, "we are entering the holy of holies in the Passion-history." We have, indeed, come through the courts of the temple, we have left the courts of the Gentiles, of the women, of the priests behind us, and have been waiting in the holy place of sacrifice and incense and ablution; now we follow our great High Priest to the veil over the holiest of all, and he prepares us to listen to the intercession that he makes before the unveiled majesty of the Father's love. The first section, extending from <a href="../../par/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31-14:31</a>, reports a series of questions by Peter, Thomas, Philip, Jude, which all turn more or less on the anticipated separation which he teaches them to regard as a veritable glorification of the Son of man, and also as a higher revelation to them of the nature of his own Person and of those relations between "the Son" and "the Father" which are imaged and shadowed forth in those between" the Son of man" and "God," which they could more readily understand. This prepares the way for the discourse and prayer which followed, in which the future spiritual union between the victorious Lord and his own disciples, between a sanctified humanity and the eternal Godhead, is exhibited, distinguished by wonderful blending of intuitive insight and supernatural revelation. The discourse is consistent with the stupendous conception which the evangelist had formed of the Person of Christ. Hilgenfeld and ethers regard this address as utterly incompatible with the valedictory discourses of <a href="../../par/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24, 25</a>, and <a href="../../par/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>. We have already seen that they are but different aspects of the same mysterious and wonderful Personage; that the synoptists are not silent concerning the spiritual presence of Christ in and with his disciples till the end of the world; and, on the other hand, that the fourth evangelist is perfectly alive to the reality of his kingdom in the world and to the true nature of his second coming. (On the historical character of this discourse, see Introduction, pp. 126, 127.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - (The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> is not omitted by T.R. or Westcott and Holt.

Bengel says, "Jesus passionem ut breve iter spectatet metam potius prospicit." As Son of man, he has secured the highest glory of the most tender, humiliating self sacrifice, has cast out of the covenanted fellowship the hateful, baneful virus of a carnal triumph. To his eye as Son of man the end is secured, just as in <a href="../../par/john/17-10.htm">John 17:10</a> he says, "I have been glorified in them." The thought is certainly complete without the clause appended in T.R., which simply reiterates the last clause, in order to make it the basis of a further thought: God will glorify him in (himself), if his suffering and sacrificed humanity has been the scene and material of a glory given to God, because a new manifestation of the Divine fullness in humanity; that is the reason why his very humanity will be lifted up into the Divine glory, itself becoming one with it, exalted far above these heavens, that he might fill <span class="accented">all things</span>. Elsewhere we read that "Christ is hidden in God" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>). All his earthly sufferings will now be seen to be a forth-streaming of Divine love, the fullest revelation of the innermost essence of God (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). Godet says, "When God has been glorified by a being, he draws him to his bosom and envelops him <span class="accented">in</span> his glory." This expression scarcely sustains the sublime uniqueness of the glory of God in the Son of man, and the glory of the Son of man in God. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and will straightway glorify him</span> show how imminent was the glorification which is consummated by the new meaning put into death, and into all that leads to it and into the sacrifice involved in it. That "straightway glorify him" is a note of triumph, and this while Judas is completing his bargain (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> of this verse; cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>).

The adoption of the gentle love-word is appropriate as a link to the new commandment, and reveals the love of departure, the tender love that wells up in his heart, as he contemplates the orphan-like and bereft condition of his disciples. <span class="cmt_word">A little while am I still with you.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall seek me</span> in the way of sympathetic love and vivid realization of my spiritual and real presence; <span class="cmt_word">and as I said ante the Jews</span> (a term that Christ used in this place only when speaking to his disciples, though he had made use of it to the Samaritans, and would use it to Caiaphas and Pilate), in <a href="../../par/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33, 34</a>, and John 8:21; but there and then he added, "Ye will not find me," because they would only seek him in carnal ideas and angry disappointment. Observe, he does not here repeat this consequence of the search, because ultimately these disciples would not only seek, but follow and find; nevertheless, he adds: As I said to the Jews, <span class="cmt_word">Whither I go, you are not able to come; so at this time I say to you.</span> There are two words used for "now" - <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> denotes absolutely the present moment; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/9-19.htm">John 9:19, 25</a>, etc.) denotes here and there, a <span class="accented">period</span> distinct from past and future, and yet related to both. The time is not yet come for you to enter into my glory; you cannot yet come, you have to continue my earthly ministry, to prolong the testimony which I have given concerning God, and which God has given concerning me. The time will come when "I will receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also;" but now he prays, "though I am no more in this world, these are in the world holy Father, keep them" (<a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a></div><div class="verse">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The demand which this glorification would make on the mutual fidelity and affection of the disciples</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A new commandment I give unto you</span> (<span class="accented">with the purpose and scope</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that ye love one another; even as</span> (or, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I loved you, that ye</span> (<span class="accented">also</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>love one another</span>. The interpretation of this verse largely depends on the meaning given to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span>, if, as many translate it, "even as I loved you;" or, "after the manner and type of my love to you;" then an amply sufficient explanation arises of the <span class="accented">novelty</span> of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. So new a type of love is given that, as the Greek expositors generally have urged, there is a deeper intensity in the love than can be found in the Mosaic principle, Love thy neighbor as <span class="accented">thyself</span>." In this commandment, which embraces the whole law, self-love is assumed, and is made the standard for the love of neighbor. This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, on the other hand, would be based on a new principle, and measured by a higher standard, and even mean more than love of self altogether. Christ's love to his disciples was self-abandoning, self-sacrificing love. This view of the passage is urged by Lucke, and really removes all necessity for the varied translations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, such as "illustrious" (Hammond); "last" (Heumann); "one that is always new" (Olshausen); "renewed commandment," a "renewing commandment" (Augustine and Maldonatus); "the institution of the Eucharist" (Lange). But it is doubtful whether the ideal image of a perfect love constitutes the novelty, and whether the double <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> and the transposition of the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> be found in the simple style of John. If, however, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> be taken as "seeing that," or "since I loved you" (see <a href="../../par/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>), Christ's love becomes not so much the manner or type, as the motive, ground, and principle of love to one another. As if he had said, "I have loved each of you unto death; in loving one another you are loving me, you are loving an object of my tender love. The desire of mere imitation, however strong, is not equal to the demand I make, while the bestowment of the 'new' principle of life arising from a response to my love <span class="accented">is</span>." For the first interpretation speaks John's own use of the idea (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>). There is a third interpretation, which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> a sentence parallel with the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. "Even as up to this moment, and up to my death, and to the uttermost, I have loved you, I <span class="accented">give</span>," etc., "<span class="accented">in</span> order that ye may love one another, and, inspired by me, may imitate my love one towards another" (Westcott). This is an endeavor to combine both interpretations. Alford suggests that the "newness" of the commandment consists in its "<span class="accented">unicity</span>," its being the prime injunction of the new covenant, and the first-fruit of the Spirit (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>.). Tholuck sees the expression of self-renouncing love - the love of the highest to the sinful, the love which is more blessed to give than to receive, the all-embracing love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a></div><div class="verse">By this shall all <i>men</i> know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By</span> (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one toward another</span>. Not by works of majesty and power, but by love to one another. All commentators refer to the well-known saying of St. John at Ephesus, as recorded by Jerome, "This is the Lord's commandment. If ye love one another it is enough" (Tholuck refers to Tertullian's 'Apol.,' 39; Minucius Felix, "They love before they know each other ;" and Lucian, "Their Master makes them believe they are brothers," 'De Mort. Pereg.'). Analogies to the great law of Christ may be found in the Law of Moses, in Talmudical writings, in the Confucian 'Analcets,' and in Stoical maxims; but this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> in its fullness, and as sustained by this motive, or inspired by this pattern, and lifted to this standard, is <span class="accented">new</span> to the human race: and it is the power which has revolutionized thought, society, and life. So long as this great power prevailed, the Church made astounding progress; when the so-called disciples of Christ began to hale and kill one another the progress was arrested. But, thank God, the "new commandment" has always had marvelous power over the Church of Christ.

I will lay down my life for thy sake.</span> Compare the language of Thomas (<a href="../../par/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a>), "Let us go, that we may die with him." Peter thought himself ready to die for his Lord, before his Lord had died for him. He who had seen; the glory of the Transfiguration, and the majesty of Christ's power, and the depth of an uttermost love, was ready, as he thought, for any sacrifice, for the most complete self abandonment; but he miscalculated his strength of will and the tenacity of his purpose. "Quid in animo ejus esset cupiditatis videbat, quid virium non videbat" (Augustine). St. Paul, long before St. John made this conversation known, must have gathered from the known teaching of Jesus the same sublime subtle truth, that it is possible to dare a martyr's death, and yet to be without true love (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2, 3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-38.htm">John 13:38</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?

In <a href="../../par/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31-35</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/11-27.htm">Mark 11:27-31</a> the announcement of Peter's fate is made on the way to the garden of Gethsemane; Luke's account (<a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>, etc.) may harmonize chronologically with this statement of John; but from all we know of Peter, it is probable that, after his long silence maintained during the discourse of <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14-17</a>, his love may have been so quickened and deepened as to have once more induced the reiteration of his fidelity and his willingness to die for and with his Master, only to receive again a more explicit warning of his weakness. Towards the close of the sixteenth chapter of this Gospel, the Lord warns all his disciples of their inability to stand the tremendous test to which they would soon be exposed. If we reject the "harmony," and refuse to double the prediction, we should be strongly inclined, with Meyer and Lucke, to accept the higher credibility of John's chronology than that of Matthew or Mark. The extraordinary character of this prediction, recorded in all four Gospels, is one of the most vivid proofs of our Lord's supernatural power, and in its detail and definiteness places him among those who claim attention from their absolute knowledge, and not their vague guess of the future. Yet there was no fate in this prediction; for Peter is afterwards warned, entreated, prayed for even, by Immanuel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
