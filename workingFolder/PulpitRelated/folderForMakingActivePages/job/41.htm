It is thus a descriptive epithet rather than a name, and has not unnaturally been used to designate more than one kind of animal. The best modern critics regard it as applied sometimes to a python or large serpent, sometimes to a cetacean, a whale or grampus, and sometimes, as hero, to the crocodile. This last application is now almost universally accepted. The crocodile was fished for by the Egyptians with a hook, and in the time of Herodotus was frequently caught and killed (Herod., 2:70); but probably in Job's day no one had been so venturous as to attack him. <span class="cmt_word">Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</span> rather, or press <span class="accented">down his tongue with a cord?</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "tie a rope round his lower jaw, and so press down his tongue."

Besides dogs, we find the Egyptians keeping tame antelopes, leopards, and monkeys. A tame crocodile would certainly seem to be an extraordinary pet, but Herodotus says that the Egyptians tamed them (2:39), and Sir Gardner Wilkinson informed me that he had known some tame ones at Cairo. The Mesopotamian Arabs domesticate falcons to assist them in the chase of the bustard and the gazelle (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 481-483). And this usage, though not represented on the Assyrian monuments, is likely to have been ancient. <span class="cmt_word">Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Wilt thou so secure him that he may be delivered over to thy handmaidens, to be made their pet and playfellow?

As no one of these last could be imagined rich enough to make the purchase alone, a further question is asked, <span class="cmt_word">Shall they part him among the merchants?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> allow a number to club together, each taking a share.

The skin of the crocodile is penetrable in very few places, and his capture by a single man with a harpoon, though now sometimes practised (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 99), is still a work of danger and difficulty. Or his head with fish-spears? Fish-spears would have small effect on the head of a crocodile, which is bony and covered by a very tough skin. There is a vulnerable place, however, at the point where the head joins the spine, at which the ancient Egyptians, when they ventured to attack the crocodile, were wont to strike (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 545).

This is again ironical, like vers. 3-6. "Only just put forth thy hand against him - bethink thee of war - do it once and no more." (comp. Rosenmuller, 'Scholia in Jobum,' p. 976). The idea is that once will be enough. A man will not live to do it a second time.

The crocodile is often seen asleep, or nearly asleep, upon sand-banks washed by the Nile. He would be a bold man who should creep near, and stir him up<span class="cmt_word">.

The allusion is to Job's persistent demand for a hearing - a controversy (<a href="../../par/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3-7</a>, etc.) - a trial, in which he shall plead with God, and God with him, upon even terms as it were, and so the truth concerning him, his sins, his integrity, his sufferings, and their cause or causes, shall be made manifest. God resists any and every claim that is made on him to justify himself and his doings to a creature. He is not a debtor to any. If he explains himself to any extent, if he condescends to give an account of any of his doings, it is of pure grace and favour. It has been observed that we might have expected this to be the conclusion of the entire discourse begun in ch. 38; and that no doubt would have been, according to ordinary laws of human composition, its more proper place. But Hebrew poetry is erratic, and pays little regard to logical lawn If anything important has been omitted in its more proper place, it is inserted in one which is, humanly speaking, less proper. The details concerning the crocodile, which are calculated to deepen the general impression, having been passed over where we might have expected them, are here subjoined, as filling out the description of vers. 1-10.

Others suggest a more definite meaning," Who can strip off his outer covering?" the scaly coat, that is, which forms his special defence, and expose the comparatively tender skin below? If this were done, he would then be at the hunter's mercy; but who will undertake to do it<span class="cmt_word">?

Who would dare to do so? His teeth are terrible round about. The crocodile has "two rows of sharply pointed teeth, thirty or more on each side" (Russell's 'Ancient and Modern Egypt,' p. 460). They are "so formed and disposed as to tear their prey rather than masticate it" ('Dict. Universelle des Sciences,' p. 447). The voracity of the full-grown crocodile is great; and he will not scruple to attack and devour men, if they come in his way. The natives of Upper Egypt have a wholesome terror of him.

"Neesings" is old English for "sneezings." According to Aristotle, the crocodile is in the habit of sneezing, but I do not find this fact noted by modern writers Boehart asserts it very positively ('Hieroz.,' pp. 752-754), but he does not profess to speak from his own knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning</span>. This probably does not mean more than that his eyes flash with light upon occasion, which is no doubt true, though the eyes, being small, have not generally attracted very much attention.

The intention is to  represent the impression which the animal would make on an impressible but unscientific observer viewing it in its native haunts for the first time. Splashing, snorting, and throwing up spray all around, it would seem to be breathing out steam and smoke, from which the idea of fire is inseparable (see the next verse).

All the representations of dragons breathing smoke and flames, found in the myths and sagas of so many countries, probably rest upon the observed fact of team or spray streaming forth from the mouth and widely opened nostrils of the crocodile. The steam has seemed to be smoke, and smoke has naturally suggested flame and fire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/41-22.htm">Job 41:22</a></div><div class="verse">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his neck remaineth strength</span>. It has been well remarked that the whale has no neck, or at any rate none {hat is visible, while the crocodile has one that is of great strength, and that naturally attracts observation. "Le cou assez marque," says the 'Dictionnaire des Sciences' (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). It is nearly of the same diameter with the head at the point of junction, and where it adjoins the body is still larger.

Whithersoever he proceeds, he causes terror; people tremble, take to flight, and disappear.

Even the softer muscles, and parts which in most animals are yielding and flabby, in the crocodile are bound up, and, as it were, soldered together (scrap. ver. 17).

Some regard this as intended physically, and note that the great saurians, with their cold and sluggish circulation, have hearts which are comparatively torpid, not contracting or expanding readily.

In either case, the description will well suit the crocodile. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone</span>. A repetition and slight exaggeration of the preceding idea.

Egyptian historians said that one of their early kings had been slain by a crocodile (Manetho ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars 1:20, p. 98). The worship paid to crocodiles in some parts of Egypt, and the hatred felt towards them in others, were probably alike inspired by fear. AElian says that, in the districts where crocodiles were worshipped, it was not safe for any one to wash his feet or to draw water at the river, and that in the vicinity of some towns people did not dare to walk along the bank of the stream ('Nat. An.,' 10:24). In modern times they have been known to precipitate men from the bank into the water by a sweep of their tail, and then to devour them at their leisure. <span class="cmt_word">By reason of breakings they purify themselves</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they are confounded.</span> The "breakings" may by either the breakings forth of the animal from his lair among the Nile rushes, or his "breaking" of the weapons of his assailants.

(On "stubble" as a metaphor for weakness, see above, <a href="../../par/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>, and compare the next verse.)

They had heavy heads, and were quite as effective weapons as either swords or spears. If a strong man could have succeeded in dealing a blow with one on the head of a crocodile, it would probably have proved fatal; but intending assailants were doubtless charged, and scattered "as stubble," before they could find opportunity to strike. He laugheth at the shaking of a spear; rather, <span class="accented">at the rushing of the javelin</span> (see the Revised Version).

He leaves on the mud on which he has lain, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an impression as of an Oriental threshing-wain, or corn-drag, which is "a thick plank of timber, stuck full on the under side, of flints or hard cutting stones arranged in the form of the palate or rough tongue of a cow" (Sir C. Fellows, 'Asia Minor,' p. 70). The mud-banks on which crocodiles have been lying are said to be scored all over with such impressions.

The rush of the crocodile through the water of the stream or pool in which he dwells causes a stir and a commotion which is forcibly compared to the boiling of water in a caldron. <span class="cmt_word">He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment</span>. It is generally allowed that by "the sea" here is meant the Nile, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>; and <a href="../../par/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>. The swirl of the Nile, as the crocodile makes his rush, is like the heaving of a pot of boiling oil or ointment

He feels himself superior to all other animals that come within his ken. They may be "sons of pride," but he has more to be proud of than the proudest of them. Ordinarily, the lion poses as "the king of beasts;" but here he is, as it were, deposed, and relegated into the second position (<a href="../../par/job/38-39.htm">Job 38:39</a>), the crocodile being exalted into his place. From different points of view, there are several great beasts which might be regarded as the lords of the animal creation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/40.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 40"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 40" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/42.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 42"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 42" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
