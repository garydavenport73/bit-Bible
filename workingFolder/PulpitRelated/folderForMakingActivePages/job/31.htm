It is an essential part of every Egyptian representation of the final judgment of souls by Osiris. Each man's merits are formally weighed in a balance, which is carefully depicted, and he is judged accordingly. Job asks that this may be done in his case, either immediately or at any rate ultimately. He would have the act performed, <span class="cmt_word">that God may know his integrity</span>; or rather, may <span class="accented">recognize</span> it. (So Professor Leo.) Job has no doubt that a thorough investigation of his case will lead to a, acknowledgment and proclamation of his innocence.

The crime of adultery subverts the family relation, on which it has pleased God to erect the entire fabric of human society. Hence, in the Jewish Law, adultery was made a capital offence (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>), both in the woman and in the man. Among other nations the adulteress was commonly punished with death, but the adulterer escaped scot-free. In modern communities adultery is mostly regarded, not as a crime, but as a civil wrong, on account of which an action lies against the adulterer. <span class="cmt_word">It is an iniquity to be punished by the judges</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it is an iniquity of judges</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of which judges take cognizance.

Eliphaz had taxed him generally  with harshness and cruelty in his relations towards those weaker than himself (<a href="../../par/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>), but had not specially pointed to this kind of oppressiveness. As, however, this was the commonest form of the vice, Job deems it right to disclaim it, before addressing himself to the several charges brought by Eliphaz. He has <span class="accented">not</span> ill used his slaves, either male or female. He has not "despised their cause," but given it full consideration and attention; he has heard them when they contended with him; he has allowed them to "contend;" he has been a just, and not a hard master. The slavery of which he speaks is evidently of a kind under which the slave had certain rights, as was the case also under the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/31-14.htm">Job 31:14</a></div><div class="verse">What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then shall I do when God riseth up?</span> Job regards God as the Avenger and Champion of all the oppressed. If he had been harsh and cruel to his dependants, he would have provoked God's anger, and God would assuredly "rise up" one day to punish. What, then, could he (Job) do? What but submit in silence? <span class="cmt_word">When he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</span> There could be no valid defence. The slave was still a man, a brother - God's creature, equally with his master. <span class="cmt_word">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</span> God "hath made of one Mood all nations of men," and all individual me, "to dwell on the face of the earth" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>). All have rights - in a certain sense, equal rights. All are entitled to just treatment, to kind treatment, to merciful treatment. Job is before his age in recognizing the substantial equality of the slave with the freeman, which otherwise was scarcely taught by any until the promulgation of the gospel (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>).

As Eliphaz had maintained (<a href="../../par/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6, 7</a>), and as Job had already denied (<a href="../../par/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12, 16</a>). The duty of relieving the poor, solemnly enjoined upon the people of Israel in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>), was generally admitted by the civilized nations of antiquity. In Egypt it was especially insisted on. "The Egyptian's duties to mankind," says Dr. Birch, "were comprised in giving bread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, oil to the wounded, and burial to the dead" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 46). <span class="cmt_word">Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail</span>. "Thou hast sent widows away empty," was one of the accusations of Eliphaz (<a href="../../par/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>). "I caused the widow's heart," replied Job, "to sing for joy" (<a href="../../par/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>). The widow's weakness has always been felt to give her a special claim on man's benevolence (see <a href="../../par/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).

Eliphaz had specially charged Job with oppression of the fatherless (<a href="../../par/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>), and his charge had been denied by Job (<a href="../../par/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>).

Job feels that it is wrong even to care greatly for wealth. He seems almost to anticipate the saying of St. Paul, that "covetousness is idolatry" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>); and hence he passes on without pause from this sort of creature-worship to others common in his day (vers. 26, 27). which he likewise disclaims. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a></div><div class="verse">If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking <i>in</i> brightness;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I beheld the sun when it shined; literally</span>, <span class="accented">the light</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="accented">great</span> light, which God made to rule the day (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>). Sun-worship, the least ignoble form of idolatry, was widely spread in the East, and in Egypt, from a very early date. According to the views of some, the religion el' t e Egyptians was little else than a complicated sun-worship from its earliest inception to its very latest phase. "The religious notions of the Egyptians," says Dr. Birch, "were chiefly connected with the worship of the sun, with whom at a later period all the principal deities were connected. As Hag, or Harmachis, he represented the youthful or rising sun; as Ra, the midday; and as Turn. the setting sun. According to Egyptian notions, that god floated in a boat through the sky or celestial ether, and descended to the dark regions of night, or Hades. Many deities attended on his passage or were connected with his worship, and the gods Amen and Khepr, who represented the invisible and self-produced god, were identified with the sun" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' Introduction, pp. 9, 10.). Even those who do not go these lengths admit that the solar worship was, at any rate, a very main element in the cult of Egypt (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 342-364). In the Babylonian and Assyrian religion the position of the sun-god was leas prominent, but still, as San, or Shamas, he held an important place, and was the main object of religious veneration to a largo body of worshippers ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 126-128; vol. 2. pp. 17, 18). In the Vedic system the sun figured as Mitra, and in the Zoroastrian as Mithra, in both holding a high position. Among the Arabians the sun, worshipped as Orotal, is said to have been anciently the only god, though he was accompanied by a female principle named Alilat (Herod., 3:8). <span class="cmt_word">Or the moon walking in brightness</span>. The worship of the moon has. in most countries where it has prevailed, been quite secondary and subordinate to that of the sun. In Egypt. while nine gods are more or less identified with the solar luminary, two only, Khons and Thoth, can be said to represent the moon. In the Vedic and Zoroastrian systems the moon, called Soma, or Hems, almost dropped out of the popular religion, at any rate as a moon-god. In the Arabiun, Alilat, a goddess, probably represented the moon, as did Ashtoreth, a goddess, in the Pheonician. In Assyria, however, and in Babylonia, moon-worship held a higher position, Sin, the moon-god, taking precedence over Shamas, the sun-god, and being a very much more important personage (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 123-126; vol. 2. pp. 16, 17). Thus both moon-worship and sun-worship were prevalent among all, or almost all, Job's neighbours.

The sin of the heart is placed first, as the <span class="accented">fens et origo mali</span> the spiritual root of the matter. On this naturally follows the outward act which, in the case of idolatry, was commonly the act exactly expressed by the word "adore" - the movement of the hand to the mouth in token of reverence and honour (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 28:2, "Inter adorandum <span class="accented">dexteram ad osculum referimus</span>, et totum corpus circumagimus;" and Minucius Felix, Octav., 2, Caecilius, simulacro Serapidis denotato, ut vulgus superstitiosum solet, <span class="accented">manum ori admovens</span> osculum labiis pressit").

It is rightly concluded from this expression that, in the country and age of Job, the sort of idolatry which is here mentioned was practised by some, and also that it was legally punishable. <span class="cmt_word">For I should have denied the God that is above</span>. The worship of any other god besides the supreme God is, practically, atheism, since "no man can serve two  masters." Moreover, to set up two independent gods is to destroy the idea of God, which implies supremacy over every other being.

The religious traditions of the Chaldees, which note the war in heaven, the Deluge, the building of the Tower of Babel, and the confusion of tongues, contain no mention of Adam or of Paradise. Nor. so far as I am aware, is there, among other ancient legends, any near parallel to the story of the Fall as related in <a href="../../par/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>. Much less does the subordinate detail of Adam hiding himself make its appearance in any of them. The marginal rendering, "after the manner of men," is therefore, I think, to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom</span>. This is not particularly apposite to the case of Adam, who "hid himself from the presence of the Lord God <span class="accented">among the trees of the garden"</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>).
