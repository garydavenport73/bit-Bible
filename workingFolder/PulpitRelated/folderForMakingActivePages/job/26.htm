As Bildad seemed to have supposed that he needed enlightenment on these points (<a href="../../par/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2-4</a>), Job may have thought it right to make once more a plain profession of his belief (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4-18</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9-25</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dead things are formed from under the waters</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the dead from under the waters tremble.</span> Hehraists generally are agreed that one of the meanings of Rephaim (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) is "the dead" or the departed, considered especially as inhabitants of Hades (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>). And if so, this meaning is certainly appropriate here. Blidad had illustrated God's dominion from his power in heaven. Job shows that it exists alike in heaven and earth (vers. 7-13), and in the region under the earth (vers. 5, 6). There, in Sheol, under the waters of the ocean, the dead tremble at the thought of the Most High; they tremble together with other inhabitants thereof, as evil spirits, rebel intelligences, east down to Hades, and there held in durance (<a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a></div><div class="verse">Hell <i>is</i> naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hell is naked before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "can hide nothing from his eyes" - shows all its inmost recesses. And destruction hath no covering; rather, <span class="accented">Abaddon hath no covering</span> (see the Revised Version). Abaddon is sometimes "destruction," sometimes "the angel of the bottomless pit" (<a href="../../par/revelation/9-11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a>), sometimes "the bottomless pit itself" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>). Here the last of these three senses seems to suit best -  the deepest depth of the bottomless pit is no secret to God," but "naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, <i>and</i> hangeth the earth upon nothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He streteheth out the north over the empty place</span>. Over what was "empty space" or "chaos" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) God stretches out "the north" - a portion of his orderly creation - perhaps the northern portion of the heavens, where are the grandest constellations visible to the inhabitants of the world's northern half. <span class="cmt_word">And hangeth the</span>  <span class="cmt_word">earth upon nothing</span>. "Takes," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "the huge ball of the earth, and suspends it in vacancy, with nothing to support it but his own fixed will, his own firm laws." This is an idea scarcely reached by astronomers in general, at any rate till the time of Hippar-chus; and it has, not without reason, been regarded as "a very remarkable instance of anticipation of the discoveries of science' (Stanley Loathes). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he makes the clouds, that we see floating in the atmosphere, contain and hold the waters on which the productiveness of the earth depends, and which he restrains, or allows to fall in fertilizing rain, at his pleasure (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the cloud is not rent under them</span>. The metaphor is, no doubt, drawn from those water-skins, so well known in the East, and especially in Arabia, in which men stored the water for their journeys and other needs, which were liable to be "rent" by the weight of the liquid within them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-9.htm">Job 26:9</a></div><div class="verse">He holdeth back the face of his throne, <i>and</i> spreadeth his cloud upon it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He holdeth back the face of his throne</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he</span> <span class="accented">covereth up.</span> He makes the clouds to gather in the vault of heaven, above which is his throne, and in this way conceals it and covers it up. And spreadeth his cloud upon it; or, over it, so blotting it out from sight. Behind the more obvious meaning lies one which is deeper and more spiritual. God withdraws himself from sight, gathers clouds and darkness around him to be the habitation of his seat, hides from men the principles of his government and administration, makes himself unapproachable and inscrutable, is a mystery and an enigma which man cannot hope to understand or solve (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a></div><div class="verse">He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath compassed the waters with bounds</span>. God restrains within limits alike the "waters that are above the firmament" and those that are beneath it (<a href="../../par/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a>). The boundary is placed, somewhat vaguely, "at the confines of light and darkness." <span class="cmt_word">Until the day and night come to an end</span> is a mistranslation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a></div><div class="verse">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The pillars of heaven tremble</span>. The "pillars of heaven" are the mountains, on which the sky seems to rest. These "tremble," or seem to tremble, at the presence of God (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/114-4.htm">Psalm 114:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>) when he visits the earth in storm and tempest, either because the whole atmosphere is full of disturbance, and the outline of the mountains shifts and changes as rain and storm sweep over them, or because the reverberations of the thunder, which shake the air, seem to shake the earth also. <span class="cmt_word">And are astonished at his reproof</span>. To the mind of the poet this "trembling" is expressive of astonishment and consternation. He regards the mountains as hearing the voice of God in the storm, recognizing it as raised in anger, and so trembling and cowering before him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a></div><div class="verse">He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He divideth the sea with his power</span>. "Divideth" is certainly a wrong translation. The verb used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) means either "stirreth up" or "stilleth." In favour of the former rendering are Rosen-muller, Schultens, Delitzsch, Merx, and Canon Cook; in favour of the latter, the LXX., Dillmann, and Dr. Stanley Leathes. In either case the general sentiment is that God has full mastery over the sea, and can regulate its movements at his pleasure. <span class="cmt_word">And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">smiteth through Rahab.</span> (On Rahab, as the great power of evil, see the comment on Job 9:13.) God is said to have "smitten him through <span class="accented">by his understanding</span>" since in the contest between good and evil it is rather intelligence than mere force that carries the day. Power alone is sufficient to control the sea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a></div><div class="verse">By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens</span>; or, <span class="accented">by his spirit the heavens are brightness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at a breath from his mouth the heavens, lately all cloud and storm (vers. 8-11), recover their serenity, are calm and clear and bright. Our experience says, "After a storm comes a calm." Job notes that both alike are from God. <span class="cmt_word">His hand hath formed the crooked serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his hand hath pierced the swift serpent</span> (see the Revised Version). The reference is probably to "the war in heaven," already suggested by the mention of" Rahab" (ver. 12). In that war, according to the tradition that had reached Job, a great serpent, like the Egyptian Apepi (Apophis), had borne a part.
