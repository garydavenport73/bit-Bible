Bildad, in his weak reply, entirely avoids the subject, and limits himself to briefly touching two old and well-worn topics - the might of God (vers. 2, 3) and the universal sinfulness of men. On neither of these two points does he throw any fresh light. He avoids, however, the reckless charges of Eliphaz (<a href="../../par/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>) as well as the coarse menaces of Zophar (<a href="../../par/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5-29</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, Dominion and fear are with him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> with God). God is the absolute Sovereign of the universe, to whom, therefore, all created beings must perforce submit themselves. He is also terrible in his might, so that for their own sakes men should submit to his decrees. Through his active sovereignty, and the fear which he inspires, <span class="cmt_word">he maketh peace in his high places</span>. The meaning may be that, through these high attributes, God <span class="accented">maintains</span> peace among the dwellers in the supernal regions; but beyond this there is a possible allusion to a time in which peace was disturbed, and the Almighty had to "make" it, or re-establish it, (On the subject of the "war in heaven,"  and the defeat and subjection of the rebels, see the comment on Job 9:13.)

The number of the angels at any given time must be a definite one. But as there is nothing to limit the further exercise of creative power in this direction, the possible number is indefinite<span class="cmt_word">. And upon whom doth not his light arise?</span> Upon what being among all the countless thousands whom he hath created, or will create, does not the brightness of his effulgence shine in such sort that they are illumined by him, and them&deg; selves shine with a mere reflected splendour?

"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman! (comp. <a href="../../par/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>, "Who shall bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one;" and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>).

Observe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all that is purely bright in creation, "even to the moon," the most purely bright object of all, and consider that in God's sight, compared to his radiance, it has no brightness - "it shineth not." Or turn your attention from the moon to the stars, rivals of the moon in purity and brilliance, and reflect that the stars are not pure in his sight. A sort of dusky veil overspreads them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a></div><div class="verse">How much less man, <i>that is</i> a worm? and the son of man, <i>which is</i> a worm?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a>). How much less can man be pure in God's sight? An undoubted truth, or rather, perhaps, a truism, but not to the point, for Job has never really maintained that he is without sin (see ch. 7:20, 21; 9:2, 20, etc.). He has only maintained that his sins have not been of such a character as to account for his sufferings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/24.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 24"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 24" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/26.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 26"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 26" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
