The habits and instincts of the wild goat, the wild ass, and wild cattle are first noticed (vers. 1-12); then a transition is made to the most remarkable of birds, the ostrich (vers. 13-18). Next, the horse is described, and, as it were, depicted, in a passage of extraordinary fire and brilliancy (vers. 19-25). Finally, a return is made to remarkable birds, and the habits of the hawk and eagle obtain mention (vers. 26-30). Throughout, the object is to show the infinite wisdom of God, and the utter incompetence of man to explain the mysteries of nature. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?</span> The wild goats of Western Asia are of two kinds, the <span class="accented">Capra segagrus</span>, and the Asiatic ibex, or <span class="accented">Capra Sinaitica.</span> The latter is probably the animal here intended, which is called <span class="accented">yael sela</span>, "the wild goat of the rocks," and was known to the Assyrians as <span class="accented">ya-e-li.</span> It is an animal with large rough horns curving backwards, closely allied to the steinbock, or bouquetin, of the Swiss and Tyrolian Alps. It is very shy and wild, difficult of approach, and inhabiting only the most rocky and desolate tracts of Syria and Arabia. Representations of the animal, which was hunted by the Assyrian kings, are common upon the Ninevite monuments (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 140. <span class="cmt_word">Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</span> "The hinds" here are probably the females of the species of ibex intended. The clause is therefore a mere repetition, in other words, of the preceding one.

In Job's time probably no one had made such subjects an object of inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</span> This would be less difficult to observe. The breeding-time of most wild animals is known in the country which produces them.

Parturition is a pain, even to the brute creation, though, comparatively speaking, a light one. (For the figure of speech by which that which causes pain is called pain, see AEschyl., 'Agam.,' 1. 1427; Eurip., 'Ion,' 1. 45; Herod., 5:18.)

Hebr. et Chald.,' p. 87). They go forth, and return not unto them. They quit their dams early, and "go forth" to provide for themselves - an indication of health and strength. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a></div><div class="verse">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</span> Two kinds of <span class="accented">onager</span> or wild ass, seem to be intended - the one called <span class="accented">pore</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>), and the other '<span class="accented">arod</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>). These correspond probably to the <span class="accented">Asinus hemippus</span> and the <span class="accented">Asinus onager</span> of modern naturalists, the former of which is still found in the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Northern Arabia, while the latter inhabits Western Asia from 48&deg; N.lat. southward to Persia, Beloochistan, and Western India. Sir H. A. Layard describes the former, which he saw, as a "beautiful animal, in fleetness equalling the gazelle, very wild, and of a rich fawn colour, almost pink" ('Nineveh and its Remains,' Vol. 1. p. 324). The latter (<span class="accented">Asinus onager</span>) was seen by Sir R. K. Porter in Persia ('Travels,' vol. 1. p. 460), and is described in very similar terms. The two, however, appear to be distinct species (see Dr. Smith's  'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 3. pp. 19, 20, Appendix). Both animals are remarkable for extreme wildness; and all attempts to domesticate the young of either have hitherto failed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-6.htm">Job 39:6</a></div><div class="verse">Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose house I have made the wilderness</span>. The Mesopotamian regions inhabited by the <span class="accented">Asinus hemippus</span> are those vast stretches of rolling plain, treeless, producing a few aromatic shrubs and much wormwood, which intervene between the Sinjar mountain-range and the Babylonian alluvium. Here the wild ass was seen by Xenophon and the Ten Thousand, in company with ostriches, gazelles, and bustards (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:5); and here Sir Austin Layard also made its acquaintance ('Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 270). The <span class="accented">Asians onager</span> frequents the deserts of Khorassan and Beloochistan, which are even more barren than the Mesepotamian. <span class="cmt_word">And the barren land his dwellings</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the salt land</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> the Revised Version). The great desert of Khorassan is largely impregnated with salt, and in places encrusted with it. The wild ass licks salt with avidity.

By "mountains" we must here understand rocky ranges like the Sinjar and the mountains of Beloochistan, or again those of the Sinaitic peninsula. Wild asses do not frequent the regions which we commonly call mountainous<span class="cmt_word">.

The word used is <span class="accented">rem</span> or <span class="accented">reyrn</span>; and the <span class="accented">rem</span> is distinctly said in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a> to have "horns." All that is said of the rim in Scripture points to some species of wild cattle, and recent critics are almost universally agreed thus far at any rate. Assyrian investigation carries us a step further. It is found that the wild bull so often represented on the monuments as hunted by the Ninevite monarchs was known to the Assyrians by the name of <span class="accented">rimu</span> or <span class="accented">rim</span>. Careful examination of the sculptures has resulted in the identification of this animal with <span class="accented">Bee primi-genius</span> an extinct species, probably identical with the urns of the Romans, which Caesar saw in Gaul, and of which he has left a description. "These uri," he says, "are scarcely less than elephants in size, but in their nature, colour, and form are bulls. Great is their strength, and great their speed; nor do they spare man nor beast, when once they have caught sight of him. ... Even when they are young, they cannot be habituated to man and made tractable. The size and shape of their horns are very different from those of our own oxen" ('De Bell. Gall.,' 6:28).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-11.htm">Job 39:11</a></div><div class="verse">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength <i>is</i> great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?</span> If a man could bind the urns to his plough or to his harrow, still he could not "trust" him. The huge brute would be sure to prove unmanageable, and would only cause damage to his owner. <span class="cmt_word">Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</span> As thou leavest many labours to thy oxen, confiding in their docility.

The "strength" of the urns (ver. 11) would make all such labours light to  him, but his savage nature would render it impossible to use him for them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Gavest thou</i> the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?</span> rather, <span class="accented">the wing of the ostrich</span> (literally, <span class="accented">of ostriches</span>) <span class="accented">is exultant</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a thing that it glories in. The allusion is, perhaps, to the flapping of its wings by the ostrich, as it hurries over the ground, which is sore, thing like that of a cock before crowing or after beating an antagonist. Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? This clause is very obscure, but may perhaps mean, <span class="accented">Are her feathers and plumage kindly?</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> does she use them for the same kindly purpose as other birds - to warm her eggs, and forward the process of hatching them? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14</a></div><div class="verse">Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust.</span> The best authorities tell us that in tropical countries ostriches, having scratched a hole in the sand, and deposited their eggs in it, cover the eggs over with a layer of sand, sometimes as much as a foot in thickness, and, leaving them during the daytime to be kept warm by the heat of the sun, only incubate at night. It is evidently this habit of the bird that is here alluded to. That in cooler countries ostriches do not do this is not to the point. The habit was known in Job's time, and was so noticeable as to characterize the bird to a large extent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-15.htm">Job 39:15</a></div><div class="verse">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</span> Where the eggs are covered by a layer of sand a foot thick, this danger is not incurred. But when the eggs are numerous - and they are sometimes as many as thirty - they are apt to be very poorly covered, and the results follow which are described in the text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-16.htm">Job 39:16</a></div><div class="verse">She is hardened against her young ones, as though <i>they were</i> not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers.</span> This is a deduction from what has preceded, and discloses no new fact. Recent careful observation of the habits of the ostrich indicates that the parental instinct is not wanting, though it may be weaker than in most birds. Both the male and the female incubate at night, and, when the nest is approached by the hunter, the parent bird or birds will leave it, and try to draw him away from it by running on in front of him, or feigning to attack him, much as peewits do in our own country. <span class="cmt_word">Her labour is in vain without fear</span>; or, <span class="accented">though her labour is in vain</span>, <span class="accented">she is without fear</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though she is often disappointed of her immediate hope of offspring, through her eggs being crushed and destroyed, yet she grows no wiser, she does not fear for the future. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-17.htm">Job 39:17</a></div><div class="verse">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding</span>. There is an Arab proverb - "As stupid as an ostrich" - which the Arabs justify on five grounds: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The ostrich, they say, will swallow iron, stones, leaden bullets, and other things, which injure and sometimes prove fatal to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When hunted, it thrusts its head into a hush, and iron,nee that the hunter does not see it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It allows itself to be captured by transparent devices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It neglects its eggs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Its head is small, and contains but a small quantity of brains. To these grounds I may add that in the South-African ostrich-farms, the birds allow themselves to be confined within a certain space by a fence of sticks and string raised about a foot from the ground. They seem to think that they cannot step over it.

The ostrich sometimes tries to elude pursuit by crouching and hiding behind hillocks or in hollows, making itself as little conspicuous as possible; but, when these attempts fail, and it starts off to run in the open, then it "lifts itself up" to its full elevation, beats the air with its wings, and scours along at a pace that no horse can equal. The Greeks with Xenophon, though well mounted, failed to catch a single ostrich ('Anab.,' 1:5. &sect; 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19</a></div><div class="verse">Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou given the horse strength?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>). <span class="accented">Geburah</span> means, however, more than "strength." It includes courage and all martial excellence. <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</span> Many objections have been taken to this expression; and endeavours have been made to show that the word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) does not mean "thunder," but" a tremulous motion," "quivering muscles and a tossing mane," or else "scorn," "indignation." But as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">always</span> means "thunder" (<a href="../../par/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/39-25.htm">Job 39:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a>: 81:8; 145:7; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>), it seems unlikely that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> means anything else. To the objection that the metaphor is "incongruous" (Professor Lee), it would appear to be enough to reply that one of our greatest prose-poets has seen in it peculiar fitness. <span class="accented">So true every way</span>" says Carlyle, on the passage: "true eyesight and vision for all things; material things, not less than spiritual; "the horse - Hast thou clothed his neck with <span class="accented">thunder?</span>" ('Lectures on Heroes,' p. 78).

Canon Cook appositely compares Virgil's "carat tellurem" ('Georg.,' 3:87, 88), and Professor Lee Pope's expression, that "ere they start a thousand steps are lost." The verb is in the plural, because a line of cavalry, all pawing and eager to be off, is intended to be represented. And rejoiceth in his strength. Nothing is more remarkable than the eagerness and joy which war-horses show when the battle approaches. They are generally more excited than their riders. He goeth on to meet the armed men; literally, <span class="accented">he rusheth upon the weapons</span>. Equally true in ancient and in modern warfare. The main use of cavalry is in the charge (see Denison's 'Hist. of Cavalry,' pp. 507-512).

In the Aasyrian sculptures the quiver of mounted archers is often hung at the side, instead of at the back. In this position it would rattle against the neck of the war-horse (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2 p. 25). The glittering spear and the shield would occasionally strike against his neck or his shoulders.

This is a common metaphor to denote the rapidity with which the horse covers the space that lies before him. Virgil has, "Corripiuut spatia" ('AEnid,' 5:316); Silius ltalions, "Campum volatu rapucre" (3:308); Shakespeare, "He seemed in running to devour the way." Arab poets have similar expressions (see Bochart, ' Hieroz.,' pt. 1. bk. 2. <span class="accented">o.</span> 8). Neither beiieveth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. (So Schultens, Canon Cook, and our Revisers.) But most recent critics prefer to render, "He standeth not still when the trumpet soundeth," and compare Virgil's "Stare loco nescit" ('Georg.,' 3:84).

The power of the eagle to "mount up," notwithstanding its great size and weight, is very surprising.

It has been asserted that this is not the case, since they are fed on carrion (Merx).
