Job wishes that, before men blame him, they would calmly weigh the force of his feelings and expressions against the weight of the calamity which oppresses him. His words may seem too strong and too violent; but are they more than a just counterpoise to the extreme character of his afflictions? The weighing of words and thoughts was an essential element in the Egyptian conception of the judgment, where Thoth held the balance, and in the one scale were placed the merits of the deceased, in the other the image of Ma, or Truth, and his fate was determined by the side to which the balance inclined ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. 125; Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 5. p. 252). <span class="cmt_word">And my calamity laid in the balances together</span>.

Therefore my words are swallowed up</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">therefore have my words been rash.</span> Job here excuses without justifying himself. The excessive character of his sufferings has, he declares, forced him to utter rash and violent words, as these wherein he cursed his day and wished that he had never been born (<a href="../../par/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1, 3-11</a>). Some allowance ought to be made for rash speech uttered under such circumstances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">For the arrows of the Almighty <i>are</i> within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the arrows of the Almighty are wlthin me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, "For thine arrows stick fast in me"). So Shakespeare speaks of "the slings and <span class="accented">arrows</span> el outrageous fortune" for calamities generally. The metaphor is a very common one (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-13.htm">Lamentations 3:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The poison whereof</span>. Poisoned arrows, such as are now employed by the savage tribes of Central Africa, were common in antiquity, though seldom used by civilized nations. Ovid declares that the Scythians of his time made use of them ('Tristia,' 1, 2). <span class="cmt_word">Drinketh up my spirit</span>; rather, <span class="accented">my spirit drinketh up.</span> Job's spirit absorbs the poison that festers in his wounds, and therefore loses control over itself. This is his apology for his vehemence; he is well-nigh distraught. He adds<span class="cmt_word">, The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me</span>. Besides actual pains and sufferings, he is assailed by fears. God's terrors, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the other evils that he has at his disposal, are drawn up against him, as it were, in battle array, and still further agitate and distract his soul. What further troubles may not God bring upon him?

Job means to say that his own complainings are as natural and instinctive as these of animals (On the species of wild asses known to Job, see the comment on Job 39:5.) <span class="cmt_word">Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span> The lowing of the ox, like the braying of the wild ass, is a complaint - a sign of distress and discomfort. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-6.htm">Job 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there <i>any</i> taste in the white of an egg?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?</span> or, <span class="accented">that which is insipid.</span> Many critics suppose that in this and the following verse Job reproaches Eliphaz with the insipidity of his remarks, and declares that his soul refuses to touch such loathsome food. Others regard him as still speaking in his own defence, and justifying his expressions of disgust by the nauseous character of the food which had been put before him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the treatment which he has received. Either explanation produces good sense; but perhaps the former is the more natural<span class="cmt_word">. Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span> So our Revisers; and so Dillmann and Canon Cook. Professor Lee suggests "the whey of cheese" for "the white of an egg;" others, "the juice of purslaine." We have certainly no other evidence that eggs were eaten in primitive times. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-7.htm">Job 6:7</a></div><div class="verse">The things <i>that</i> my soul refused to touch <i>are</i> as my sorrowful meat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The things that my soul refuse to touch are as my sorrowful meat</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">my soul refuseth</span>  <span class="accented">to touch them</span>; <span class="accented">they are as loathsome meat to</span> me. The doubt remains whether Job is speaking of the arguments of Eliphaz, or of the series of afflictions which have befallen him. Either explanation is possible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-8.htm">Job 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant <i>me</i> the thing that I long for!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that I might have my request!</span> Here the second point is taken up. Eliphaz has threatened Job with death, representing it as the last and most terrible of punishments (<a href="../../par/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9, 20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>). Job's reply is that there is nothing he desires so much as death. His primary wish would have been never to have been born (<a href="../../par/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-10</a>); next to that, he would have desired an early death - the earlier the more acceptable (<a href="../../par/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11-19</a>). As both these have been denied him, what he now desires, and earnestly asks for, is a speedy demise. It is not as yet clear what he thinks death to be, or whether he has any hope beyond the grave. Putting aside all such considerations, he here simply balances death against such a life as he now leads, and must expect to lead, since his disease is incurable, and decides in favour of death. It is not only his desire, but his "request" to God, that death may come to him quickly. <span class="cmt_word">And that God would grant me the thing that I long for</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my expectation</span> or <span class="accented">wish</span>. The idea of taking his own life does not seem to have occurred to Job, as it would to a Greek (Plato, 'Phaedo,' &sect; 16) or a Roman (Pithy, 'Epist.,' 1:12). He is too genuine a child of nature, too simple and unsophisticated, for such a thought to occur, and, if it occurred, would be too religious to entertain it for a moment. Like Aristotle, he would feel the act to be cowardly (Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 5, <span class="accented">sub fin.</span>); and, like Plato (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), he would view it as rebellion against the will of God.

"Cut me off <span class="accented">bit by bit"</span> (Lee); comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>, where the same word is used of a weaver, who cuts the threads of his loom one by one, until the whole is liberated and comes away. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then should I yet have comfort</span>. First, the comfort that the end was come, and that he would be spared further sufferings; and further, the still greater comfort that he had endured to the end, and not. denied nor renounced his trust in religion and in all the "words of the Holy One." Professor Lee sees here "the recognition of a future life, expressed in words as plain and obvious as possible" ('Book of the Patriarch Job,' p. 223). But to us it seems that, if the idea is present at all, it is covered up, latent; only so far implied as it may be said to be implied in all willingness to die, since it may be argued that even the most wretched life possible would be preferred by any man to no life at all, and so that when men are content to die they <span class="accented">must</span> be expecting, whether consciously or not, a life beyond the grave, and be sustained by that expectation<span class="cmt_word">. Yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare;</span> rather, yea, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">would exult in anguish that did not spare.</span> However great the pain that accompanied his death, Job would rejoice and exult in it, since by it his death was to be accomplished<span class="cmt_word">. For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for I have not denied</span> or <span class="accented">renounced.</span> It would be a part of Job's satisfaction in dying that he had not let go his integrity. Rather he had held it fast, and not renounced or abandoned his trust in God and in religion. "The words of the Holy One are the commands of God, however made known to man" (Canon Cook).

Job rejects this suggestion. His strength is brought too low; it is not conceivable that he should be restored, he cannot entertain any such hope. <span class="cmt_word">And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</span> rather, <span class="accented">that</span> I <span class="accented">should stretch out my spirit.</span> Job cannot look forward to such an "end" as Eliphaz prophesies for him; therefore he cannot bring himself to wait on with patience.

Job cannot pretend to either. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not my help in me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Is it not that I have no help in me?</span> (Revised Version). Job feels that, instead of having exceptional strength of constitution to enable him to bear up against his exhausting malady, he is absolutely without strength. All his vital power is used up. There is no help in him. <span class="cmt_word">And is wisdom driven quite from me?</span> rather, I<span class="accented">s not soundness driven quite from me? Tushiyah</span> seems to mean here "strength of constitution" - that internal soundness which resists the inroads of disease, and sometimes triumphs over the most serious maladies. Whatever reserve of this kind he may have possessed by nature, it is now, Job feels, altogether lost and gone from him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">To him that is afflicted pity <i>should be shewed</i> from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend</span>. Job begins here the third head of his reply to Eliphaz, in which he attacks him and his companions. The first duty of a comforter  is to compassionate his afflicted friend, to condole with him, and show his sympathy with his sufferings. This is what every one looks for and expects as a matter of course. But Job has looked in vain. He has received no pity, no sympathy. Nothing has been offered him but arguments. And what arguments! How do they touch the point? How are they anything more than a venting of the speaker's own self-righteousness? Let them fairly consider his case, and point out to him where he has been blamable<span class="cmt_word">. But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even though he forsake the fear of the Almighty</span>, or <span class="accented">else might he forsake the fear of the Almighty.</span> Job certainly does not mean to admit that he has renounced the fear of God, and become an apostate from religion; but only to assert, either, that, even had he done so, his friends ought still to have shown him kindness, or else that their not showing him kindness is the very way to drive him to apostasy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, <i>and</i> as the stream of brooks they pass away;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My brethren</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my three friends," Eliphaz, who has spoken; Bildad and Zophar, who by their silence have shown their agreement with him. <span class="cmt_word">Have dealt deceitfully as a brook</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "a winter torrent" - a "wady," to use the modern Arab expression. These watercourses are characteristic of Palestine and the adjacent regions. "During the winter months," says Dr. Cunningham Geikie, "they are often foaming rivers; but in the hot summer, when they would be of priceless value, their dry bed is generally the road from one point to another. The water rushes over the sheets of rock as it would from the roof of a house, and converging, as it descends, into minor streams in the higher wadies, these sweep on to a common channel in some central valley, and, thus united, swell in an incredibly short time into a deep, troubled, roaring flood, which fills the whole bottom of the wady with an irresistible torrent...  The streams from Lebanon, and also from the high mountains of the Hauran. send down great floods of dark and troubled waters in spring, when the ice and snow of their summits are melted; but they dry up under the heat of summer, and the track of the torrent, with its chaos of boulders, stones, and gravel, seems as if it had not known a stream for ages. So Job's friends had in former times seemed as if they would be true to him for ever; but their friendship had vanished, like the rush of the torrent that had passed away" ('The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 123-125). <span class="cmt_word">And as the stream of brooks they pass away</span>; or, <span class="accented">the channel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wady itself. Canon Cook well says on this, "The simile is remarkably complete. When little needed, the torrent overflows; when needed, it disappears. In winter it does not fertilize; in summer it is dried up. Nor is it merely useless; it deceives, alluring the traveller by the appearance of verdure, promising refreshment, and giving none."

Job seems to have seen wadys where, in the winter-time, the water was actually frozen into hard black ice. This scarcely occurs now in the countries bordering on Palestine; but may have occurred in the region where Job dwelt, formerly. "Dark, turbid water" can scarcely be intended. And <span class="cmt_word">wherein the snow</span> is hid. Some suppose <span class="accented">melted</span> snow to be meant; but the deep wadies in the Hauran and elsewhere would easily conceal snowdrifts.

But nothing is commoner than for caravans short of water to go out of their way in order to reach a wady, where they expect to be able to replenish their water-skins. If they are disappointed, if the wady is dry, they may be brought into great straits, and may even possibly perish. (For a probable instance, where dependence on a wady would, but for a miracle, have led to a great disaster, see <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9-20</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">They go to nothing, and perish</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they go up into the waste</span> <span class="accented">and perish.</span> Having vainly sought water in the dry wady, they ascend out of it, and enter the broad waste of the desert, where they too often miserably perish.

The Tema were an Arab tribe descended from Ishmael (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>). They are generally conjoined with Dedan (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>), another Arab tribe, noted for carry-lug on a caravan trade. Both tribes probably wandered, and occupied at different periods different portions of the desert. The name, Tema, may linger in the modern city and district of <span class="accented">Tayma</span> on the confines of Syria, and upon the pilgrim-route between Damascus and Mecca. The "troops of Tema" probably looked for the "caravans" of ver. 18 to arrive in their country; but they looked in vain.

Shame and confusion of face came upon them in consequence of their  vain hope. In the same way, Job implies, he is ashamed of having looked for compassion and kindness from his friends. He should have been wiser and have known better. <span class="cmt_word">They came thither, and were ashamed</span>. They not only hoped, but acted on their hope-let it turn them aside from their way (ver. 18) and bring them to ruin.

Here Job penetrates to the motive which had produced the conduct of his friends. They had come with good intentions, meaning to comfort and console him; but when they came, and saw what a wreck he was, how utterly "broken up" and ruined, they began to be afraid of showing too much friendliness. They thought him an object of the Divine vengeance, and feared lest, if they showed him sympathy, they might involve themselves in his punishment.

No. I neither requested you to bring me anything for myself, nor to make a present to any one on my behalf; much less did I call upon you to deliver me out of the hand of my enemies, to chastize the Chaldeans and the men of Sheba (<a href="../../par/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15, 17</a>), and recover. from them my property.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-24.htm">Job 6:24</a></div><div class="verse">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue.</span> Job is willing to be taught, if his friends have any instruction to give. He is willing to be reproved. But not in such sort as he has been reproved by Eliphas. His words were not "words of uprightness." <span class="cmt_word">Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</span> Point out, that is, in what my assumed guilt consists. You maintain that my afflictions are deserved. Point out what in my conduct has deserved them. I am quite ready to be convinced.

If the charges made by Eliphaz had been right and true, and his arguments sound and just, then Job must have yielded to them, have confessed himself guilty, and bowed down with shame before his judges. But they had had no such constraining power. Therefore they were not "words of uprightness<span class="cmt_word">." But what doth your arguing reprove?</span> literally, <span class="accented">What</span> <span class="accented">doth your reproving reprove?</span> That is - What exactly is it that ye think to be wrong in me? At what is your invective aimed? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-26.htm">Job 6:26</a></div><div class="verse">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, <i>which are</i> as wind?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do ye imagine to reprove words?</span> or, <span class="accented">Do ye propose?</span> "Is it your intention?" Am I to understand that you blame nothing in my conduct, but only the words that I have spoken? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the words recorded in ch. 3<span class="cmt_word">. And the speeshes of one that is desperate, which are as wind</span>; or, whereas <span class="accented">the speehes of one that is desperate are but as wind</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for the wind -</span> spoken to the wind, for the wind to take hold of them and bear them away. Therefore not worth a reproof. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig <i>a pit</i> for your friend.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless</span>; rather, on <span class="accented">the fatherless would ye east</span> lots (comp. <a href="../../par/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>). Job means to say they are so pitiless that they would cast lots for the children of an insolvent debtor condemned to become slaves at his death (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye dig a pit for your friend</span>; or, <span class="accented">ye would make merchandise of your friend</span> as in the Revised Version. Job does not speak of what his friends had done, but of what he deems them capable of doing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-28.htm">Job 6:28</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for <i>it is</i> evident unto you if I lie.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore be content, look upon me</span>; rather, be <span class="accented">pleased to look upon me.</span> Professor Lee translates, "Look <span class="accented">favorably</span> upon me." But this addition is unnecessary. What Job desires is that his friends would look him straight in the face. Then they would not be able to doubt him. They would see that he was telling the truth. <span class="cmt_word">For it is evident unto you if I lie</span>; rather, it <span class="accented">will be evident</span> unto you, etc. Others render the passage, "For surely I shall not lie to your face" (Schultens, Canon Cook, Revised Version).

Job now justifies his words, which previously he had admitted to have been "rash" (ver. 3). Perhaps he intends to distinguish between rashness and actual wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Cannot my taste discern perverse things?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I see no perversity or wickedness in what I have said. If there were any, I think I should discern it The reasoning is somewhat dangerous, since men are not infallible judges, not being unprejudiced judges, in their own case. Job's ultimate verdict on himself is that he has "uttered that which he understood not" (<a href="../../par/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>) - wherefore he "abhors himself, and repents in dust and ashes" (<a href="../../par/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
