Zophar had been silenced earlier. Eliphaz and Bildad now felt that they had no more to say. They had exhausted the weapons of their armoury without any effect, and were conscious that nothing would be gained by mere reiteration. All their efforts had aimed at convincing Job of sin; and he was still unconvinced - he remained righteous in his own eyes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu</span>. The name "Elihu" was not uncommon among the Israelites. It is found among the ancestors of Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), among the Korhite Levites of the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a>), and as a variant for Eliab, one of David's brothers (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-8.htm">1 Chronicles 27:8</a>) The meaning of the word was, "He is my God" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Barachal</span>. Barachel is also a significant name. It means, "Bless, O God," or "God blesses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>). Both names imply that the new interlocutor belonged to a family of monotheists. <span class="cmt_word">The Buzite</span>. "Huz" and "Buz" were brothers, the sons of Nahor, Abraham's brother, by Maleah, the daughter of Haran (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kindred of Ram.</span> By "Ram" we are probably to understand "Aram," who was the son of Kemuel, a brother of Huz and Buz. (On the connection of Huz and Buz with the Arabian tribes of Khazu and Bazu, see the comment on Job 1:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God</span>. Elihu was well-intentional; and it is perhaps not surprising that he had been shocked by some of Job's expressions. Job had himself apologized for them (<a href="../../par/job/6-26.htm">Job 6:26</a>); and certainly they went perilously near taxing God with injustice (see <a href="../../par/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>). But it is to be remembered that finally God justifies Job's sayings, while condemning those of his "comforters." "My wrath is kindled," he says to Eliphaz, "against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <span class="accented">the thing that is right</span> <span class="accented">as my servant Job</span> hath" (<a href="../../par/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-3.htm">Job 32:3</a></div><div class="verse">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and <i>yet</i> had condemned Job.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer</span>. Elihu thought that Job's reasonings and complaints admitted of being satisfactorily answered, and was vexed that the three "friends" had not made the right replied It is the main object of his speech to supply them. And yet had condemned Job. They had condemned him on wrong grounds and of sins that he had not committed (<a href="../../par/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6-9</a>). Elihu condemns him as much (<a href="../../par/job/33-9.htm">Job 33:9-12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7-9</a>, etc.), but for entirely different reasons.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I <i>am</i> young, and ye <i>are</i> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-22.</span> - The speech of Elihu now begins. In the present chapter, after a short apologetic exordium, excusing his youth (vers. 6-9), he addresses himself exclusively to Job's friends. He has listened attentively to them, and weighed their words (vers. 11, 12). but has found nothing in them that confuted Job. They had not "found wisdom" - they had not "vanquished Job" - at the last they had been "amazed, and had not had a word more to say" (vers. 13-16). Elihu, therefore, will supply their deficiency; he has kept silence with difficulty, and is full of thoughts, to which he would fain give utterance (vers. 17-20). In all that he says he will show no favouritism - he will "accept no man's-person," "give no flattering titles," but express sincerely what he believes (vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old</span>. We can only guess at the exact ages of Job and his friends. From the fact that God at the last "gave Job twice as much as he had before" (<a href="../../par/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>), and the further fact that he lived, after he had recovered his prosperity, a hundred and forty years (<a href="../../par/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16</a>), it has been conjectured that he was seventy years of age at the time of his conference with his friends, and that he died at the age of two hundred and ten. But this clearly is quite uncertain. He may not have been much more than fifty when his calamities fell upon him. If this were so, the age of his friends need not have exceeded from sixty to seventy. Perhaps Elihu was himself not more than thirty. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you mine opinion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I held back and was afraid to utter what I knew in your pre</span>sence. Elihu would have been thought unduly pushing and presumptuous if he had ventured to come forward until his seniors had ended their colloquy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-7.htm">Job 32:7</a></div><div class="verse">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I kept saying to myself, when the desire to interrupt came upon me." <span class="cmt_word">Days should speak</span>. Age should give wisdom, and the speech of the old should be most worthy of being attended to. Elihu had been brought up in this conviction, and therefore refrained himself. <span class="cmt_word">And multitude of years should teach wisdom</span>. "Old experience should attain to something of prophetic strain." "One ought to give attention," says Aristotle, "to the mere unproved assertions of wise and aged men, as much as to the actual demonstrations of others" ('Eth. Nit.,' 6:11, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>. comp. also <a href="../../par/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a></div><div class="verse">But <i>there is</i> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there is a spirit in man</span>. But, after all, it is not mere age and experience that make men wise and able to teach others. "There is a spirit in man" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>); and it is according as this spirit is or is not enlightened from on high that men speak words of wisdom or the contrary. <span class="cmt_word">The inspiration of the Almighty</span> - this it is, which - <span class="cmt_word">giveth them understanding</span>. And such inspiration it is in the power of God to bestow, as he pleases, on the old or on the young, on the great of the earth, or on those of small reputation. Hence Elihu's conclusion - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-9.htm">Job 32:9</a></div><div class="verse">Great men are not <i>always</i> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged</span> (always) <span class="cmt_word">understand judgment</span>. Elihu lays down the universal law, before applying it to the particular instance. True wisdom is from God, not from observation and experience. Therefore many aged men are not wise; many experienced men, great in position, versed in affairs, do not possess understanding. It is a trite remark, "With how little wisdom the world is governed!" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-10.htm">Job 32:10</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I said, Hearken to me</span>. Elihu evidently claims, not exactly what is ordinarily understood by inspiration, but that his spirit, is divinely enlightened, and that therefore he is more competent to take part in the controversy that has been raised than many of the aged. <span class="cmt_word">I also will show mine opinion</span>. "I also," or "even I" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I, young as I am, "will show my opinion," or "utter what I know on the subject." Elihu does not speak of his convictions as mere "opinions," but claims to be in possession of actual "knowledge." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-11.htm">Job 32:11</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I waited for your words</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I was full of expectation; I waited impatiently to hear what you would say." Then, while you spoke, <span class="cmt_word">I gave ear to your reasons</span> - or, your <span class="accented">reasonings</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I did my best to apprehend your meaning - whilst ye searched out what to say</span>. Professor Lee translates, "whilst ye examined <span class="accented">Job's c</span>onclusions; but the Authorized Version is probably correct. Elihu means that he listened carefully while the friends hunted out all the arguments they could think of in order to confute Job. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, <i>there was</i> none of you that convinced Job, <i>or</i> that answered his words:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I attended unto you</span> - or, <span class="accented">lent you my attention -</span> and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job; rather, <span class="accented">that convicted</span> (or, <span class="accented">confuted</span>) Job. <span class="cmt_word">Or that answered his words</span>. In Elihu's opinion, the argumentative value of all the long  speeches of the three friends was <span class="accented">nil</span>; they had entirely failed to answer Job's arguments. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-13.htm">Job 32:13</a></div><div class="verse">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom</span>; or, <span class="accented">beware lest ye say</span>, <span class="accented">We have found wisdom</span> (see the Revised Version). "Do not suppose, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that you have triumphed in the controversy, that your mode of meeting Job's complaints is the wise and right one. The exact reverse is the case. You have not vanquished Job. On the contrary, he is unvanquished, and remains master of the field. If he is ever to be vanquished, it will not be by you. <span class="cmt_word">God thrusteth</span> (rather, <span class="accented">may thrust</span>) him down, <span class="cmt_word">not man</span>. A true prophecy! (see <a href="../../par/job/40-1.htm">Job 40:1-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-14.htm">Job 32:14</a></div><div class="verse">Now he hath not directed <i>his</i> words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now he hath not directed his words against me</span>. Elihu thinks that he can interfere in the controversy with the better prospect of a good result, since he is untouched by any of Job's words, and can therefore speak without passion or resentment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I answer him with your speeches</span>. He is also going to bring forward fresh arguments, which, as they avoid the line taken by the three friends, may soothe, instead of exasperating, the patriarch. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-15.htm">Job 32:15</a></div><div class="verse">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">They were amazed, they answered no more</span>. A change from the second to the third person, possibly as seeming less disrespectful. Or perhaps Elihu turns from the three friends at this point, as Professor Lee supposes, and addr
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-16.htm">Job 32:16</a></div><div class="verse">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, <i>and</i> answered no more;)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I had waited</span> (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more); rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and shall</span> 1 <span class="accented">wait</span> <span class="accented">because they speak not</span>, <span class="accented">because they stand still</span> <span class="accented">and answer no more? <span class="cmt_word"></span>Am I to wait until they shall have recovered themselves, and found something to answer?</span> Surely this is not necessary. Neither courtesy nor etiquette prescribes it. <span class="cmt_word">Especially when I have waited so long, and have so much to say, and am so exceedingly anxious to say it</span> (see vers. 18-20). Elihu shows all the impatience and ardour of a young speaker (see ver. 6), and feels the confidence that young men so often feel in the wisdom and persuasiveness of their words (comp. <a href="../../par/job/33-1.htm">Job 33:1-6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-17.htm">Job 32:17</a></div><div class="verse"><i>I said</i>, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show mine opinion</span>. The initial "I said" is superfluous. Elihu, having asked himself the question, "Shall I wait?" in ver. 16, here gives the answer. He will not wait any longer, he will take the word, he will set forth his conviction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-18.htm">Job 32:18</a></div><div class="verse">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am full of matter</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I am full</span> of words; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have very much to say. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit within me constraineth me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the spirit of my belly</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my inward feelings and emotions." Compare Zophar's statements in <a href="../../par/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2, 3</a>; and Job's own declarations in ch. 13, that he <span class="accented">must</span> speak (vers. 13, 19). There is a state of internal excitement, when reticence becomes impossible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-19.htm">Job 32:19</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, my belly <i>is</i> as wine <i>which</i> hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent</span>. The process of fermentation properly takes place in the vat, from which the gas evolved in the operation can freely escape. When wine was put into skins before fermentation was complete, and gas continued to be evolved, the effect was that the skins became distended, as the gas had no vent, and then not unfrequently the skins would burst, especially if they were old ones (see <a href="../../par/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It is ready to burst like new bottles</span>. Even if the skins were new, they would undergo distension, and would appear as if "ready to burst," though the actual catastrophe might be avoided. Elihu's pent-up feelings seem to him, if they do not obtain a vent, to threaten some such a result. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-20.htm">Job 32:20</a></div><div class="verse">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will speak, that I may be refreshed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that I may obtain relief</span>; or, according to some, "that I may be able to breathe" (Cook, Rosenmuller). Elihu feels almost suffocated by conflicting feelings of rage (vers. 1-3), disappointment (vers. 11, 12), and anxiety to vindicate God's honour (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I will open my lips and answer</span>. In the remainder of Elihu's discourse the attempt is made to "answer" Job (see ch. 33-37), with what success will be considered elsewhere. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-21.htm">Job 32:21</a></div><div class="verse">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person</span>. Elihu hopes that, in what he is about to say, he will not permit himself to be swayed by any personal bias; that he will neither unduly favour the upper classes nor the vulgar (see Professor Lee, on the difference between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> 'Book of Job,' p. 444), but will treat all fairly and equitably. <span class="cmt_word">Neither let me</span> (he says) <span class="cmt_word">give flattering titles unto man</span>. Professor Lee observes on this: "The Oriental practice of giving long and fulsome titles is too well known to need anything beyond the mere mention of the fact." Elihu certainly, in the whole of his address, flatters no one.
