It is remarked, with reason, that the special mention of Job as the person answered "implies that another speaker had intervened" (Wordsworth); while the attachment of the article to the word "whirlwind" implies some previous mention of that phenomenon, which is only to be found in the discourse of Elihu (<a href="../../par/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a>). Both points have an important bearing on the genuineness of the disputed section, ch. 32- 37. <span class="cmt_word">And said</span>. The question whether there was an objective utterance of human words out of the whirlwind, or only a subjective impression of the thoughts recorded on the minds of those present, is unimportant. In any case, there was a revelation direct from God, which furnished an authoritative solution of the questions debated to all who had been engaged in the debate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2</a></div><div class="verse">Who <i>is</i> this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</span> It is very noticeable that God entirely ignores the reasonings of Elihu, and addresses himself, in the first instance, wholly to Job, with whom he begins by remonstrating. Job has not been without fault. He has spoken many "words without knowledge" or with insufficient knowledge, and has thus trenched on irreverence, and given the enemies of God occasion to blaspheme. Moreover, he has "darkened counsel." Instead of making the ways of God clear to his friends and companions, he has east doubts upon God's moral government (<a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-26</a>), upon his mercy and loving-kindness (<a href="../../par/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7-14</a>), almost upon his justice (<a href="../../par/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1-35</a>). He is thus open to censure, and receives censure, and owns himself "vile" (<a href="../../par/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>), before peace and reconciliation can be established. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-3.htm">Job 38:3</a></div><div class="verse">Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gird up now thy loins like a man</span>. Job had desired to contend with God, to plead with him, and argue out his case (<a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3, 18-22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4-7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>). God now offers to grant his request, and bids him stand forth "as a man'" and "gird himself" for the contest, which he has challenged. <span class="cmt_word">For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me</span>. He will begin with interrogatories which Job must answer; then Job will be entitled to put questions to him. Job, however, on the opportunity being given him, shrinks back, and says, "Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken: but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further" (<a href="../../par/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4, 5</a>). The confident boldness which he felt when God seemed far off disappears in his presence, and is replaced by diffidence and distrust.

Didst thou witness it? If not, what canst thou know concerning it? And if thou knowest nothing of creation, what canst thou know of deeper things?

Declare, if thou hast understanding. That is, if thou hast any knowledge on the subject (comp. ver. 18).

The writer carries out his metaphor of a building by supposing a measuring-rod to have been used at the creation of the earth also. Some find a trace of the idea in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, where they translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, "Let the waters be <span class="accented">marked out with a line."</span>

They are not to be pressed. The object is to impress on Job his utter ignorance of God's ways in creation. <span class="cmt_word">Or who laid the corner-stone thereof?</span> Who gave the last finishing touch to the work (see <a href="../../par/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>)?

The stars generally, or the actual stars visible on the morn of creation, are probably meant. They, as it were, sang a song of loud acclaim on witnessing the new marvel. Their priority to the earth is implied, since they witness its birth. Their song is, of course, that silent song of sympathy, whereof Shakespeare speaks when he says, "Each in its motion like an angel sings" ('Merchant of Venice,' act 5. sc. 1). <span class="cmt_word">And all the sons of God shouted for joy</span>. "The sons of God" here must necessarily be the angels (see <a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>), since there were no men as yet in existence. They too joined in the chorus of sympathy and admiration, perhaps lifting up their voices (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11, 12</a>), perhaps their hearts only, praising the Creator, who had done such marvellous things. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8</a></div><div class="verse">Or <i>who</i> shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, <i>as if</i> it had issued out of the womb?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or who shut up the sea with doors?</span> From the earth a transition is made to the sea, as the second great wonder in creation (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24, 25</a>). God's might is especially shown in his power to control and confine the sea, which rages so terribly and seems so utterly uncontrollable. God has blocked it in "with doors" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with "bounds that it cannot pass, neither turn again to cover the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>). Sometimes the barrier is one of lofty and solid rock, which seems well suited to confine and restrain; but sometimes it is no more than a thin streak of sliver sand or a bank of loose, shifting pebbles. Yet, in both cases alike, the restraint suffices. "The sand is placed for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>); the beach of shifting pebbles remains as firm as the rock itself, and never recedes or advances more than a few feet. <span class="cmt_word">When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at its birth, when it was first formed, by the gathering together of the waters into one place (see <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-9.htm">Job 38:9</a></div><div class="verse">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I made the cloud the garment thereof</span>. The account of creation here given is certainly not drawn wholly from Genesis It is to be viewed as a second, independent, account of the occurrences, in fuller detail, but vaguer, by reason of the poetical phraseology. <span class="cmt_word">And thick darkness a swaddllng-band for it</span>. The infant sea, just come from the womb (ver. 8), is represented as clothed with a cloud, and swaddled in thick darkness, to mark its complete subjection to its Creator from the first. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-10.htm">Job 38:10</a></div><div class="verse">And brake up for it my decreed <i>place</i>, and set bars and doors,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And brake up for it my decreed place</span>; rather, as in the margin, and established my decree upon it; or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and prescribed for it my</span> decree. The decree itself is given in ver. 11. <span class="cmt_word">And set bars and doors</span> (see above, ver. 8, where the imagery of "doors" has been already introduced). As Professor Lee observes, "The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> contains a metaphor taken from the large folding-doors of a city, which are usually set up for the purpose of stepping the progress of an invading enemy, and are hence supplied with bolts and bars" ('Book of Job,' p. 490). Representations of such folding-doors are common in the Assyrian sculptures; and in one instance the doors themselves, or, to speak more exactly, their outer bronze easing, has been recovered (see a paper in the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' on the Bronze Gates discovered by Mr. Rassam at Balawat, vol. 7. pp. 85-115). These gates were twenty-two feet high and six feet broad each. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a></div><div class="verse">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said, Hitherto shalt thou corns, but no further</span>. The law is not quite absolute. Wherever the sea washes a coast-line, there is a continual erosive action, whereby the land is, little by little, eaten away, and the line of the coast thrust back. But the action is so slow that millennia pass without any considerable effect being produced, and encroachments in some places are generally counterbalanced by retrenchment in others, so that the general contour of laud and water, with the proportion of the one to the other, remain probably very much the same at the present day as when the earth first became the habitation of man. <span class="cmt_word">And here shall thy proud waves be stayed</span>. The waves of the sea "rage horribly," and every now and then topple down a rock or undermine a cliff, and seem proud of their achievements; but how little do they effect, even in thousands of years! The little islet of Psyttaleia still blocks the eastern end of the straits of Salamis. The Pharos island lies off the westernmost mouth of the Nile. Even the low, fiat Aradus, on the Syrian coast, has not been swept away. Everywhere the waves are practically "stayed," and all the menaces of the sea against the land come to nought. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12</a></div><div class="verse">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; <i>and</i> caused the dayspring to know his place;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days?</span> rather, <span class="accented">by reason of ray length of</span> days - a similar irony to that observable in vers. 5, 21, etc. The third marvel of creation brought before us is the dawn, or daybreak - that standing miracle of combined utility and beauty. Has Job authority to issue his orders to the dawn, and tell it when to make its appearance? Has he caused the dayspring to know his place? Job cannot possibly pretend to any such power. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-13.htm">Job 38:13</a></div><div class="verse">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be</span>  <span class="cmt_word">shaken out of it?</span> The idea seems to he that the dawn, suddenly appearing, seizes hold of all the ends of the earth "at one rush" (Canon Cook), and lights up the whole terrestrial region. The wicked, lovers of darkness, are taken by surprise, and receive a shock from which they recover with difficulty (comp. <a href="../../par/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16, 17</a>). That they are "shaken from the earth" must be regarded as Oriental hyperbole.

As the seal changed the clay from a dull, shapeless lump to a figured surface, so the coming of the dawn changes the earth from an indistinct mass to one diversified with form and colour. As M. Renan explains, "L'aurore fair our la terre l'effet d'un sceau sur la torte sigillee, en dormant de laforme, et du relief, a la surface do l'univers, qui pendant la nuit est somme un chaos indistinct." And they stand as a garment; rather, <span class="accented">and things stand out as a garment</span> or as <span class="accented">on a garment -</span> a richly embroidered dress is intended, on which the pattern stands out in relief.

Then, when the dawn bursts forth, "from the wicked, their light"-which is darkness (<a href="../../par/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13-17</a>) - "is withholden," and the consequence is that the high arm - the arm that is proud and lifted up - shall be broken.

Its destructive effect upon crops, even in temperate latitudes, is indicated by the insurances against damage from hail, which, even in our own country, so many farmers think it worth their while to pay.

In ancient times, when the bow held the place in war which is now occupied by the rifle or the musket, a heavy hailstorm, striking full in the face of the combatants on one side, while it only fell on the backs of their adversaries, must of tea have decided a battle.

It is thus not only creation itself, but the transformations of created things, that transcend the scientific intellect and are inexplicable. <span class="cmt_word">And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</span> This is the same question as that of the previous clause, expressed in different words

By "the deep" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>) is certainly not meant here either the open ocean, which, in the latitudes known to the dwellers in South Western Asia, never freezes, or the Mediterranean. Some of the lakes which abound in the regions inhabited by Job and his friends are probably meant. These may occasionally have been thinly coated with ice in the times when the Book of Job was written (see the comment on Job 6:16). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a></div><div class="verse">Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades?</span> (On the almost certain identification of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Kirnah</span> with the Pleiades, see the comment on Job 9:9.) Whether the "sweet influences" of the constellation are here spoken of is very doubtful. Schultens and Professor Lee support the rendering; but most critics prefer to translate the word employed (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) by "chains" or "fastenings" (Rashi, Kimchi, Rosenmuller, Dillmann, Canon Cook). If we adopt this view, we must suppose the invisible links which unite the stars into a constellation to be intended. Job is asked whether he can draw the links nearer  together, and bind the stars closer to one another. <span class="cmt_word">Or loose the bands of Orion?</span> The identity of <span class="accented">Kesil</span> with Orion is generally allowed. Job is asked if he can loosen the tie which unites the several members of this constellation together. Of course, he can pretend to no such powers.

This makes it impossible to accept the meaning, so generally assigned, of "the twelve signs of the Zodiac." Again, the plural form is fatal to the conjecture that "Mazzaroth" designates a single star or planet, as Jupiter, Venus, or Sirius (Cook). The word is derived probably from the root zahar, "to shine," "to be bright," and should designate some especially brilliant cluster of stars Whether it is to be regarded as a variant of <span class="accented">Mazzaloth</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>) is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</span> (On the identity of '<span class="accented">Ash</span> or '<span class="accented">Aish</span> with the Great Bear, see the comment on Job 9:9.)

The general prevalence of law in the material world is quite as strongly asserted by the sacred writers as by modern science. The difference is that modern science regards the laws as physical necessities, self-subsisting, while Scripture looks upon them as the ordinances of the Divine will. This latter view involves, of course, the further result that the Divine will can at any time suspend or reverse any of its enactments. <span class="cmt_word">Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</span> If Job does not even know the laws whereby the world is governed, much less can he establish such laws himself, and make them work.

None but the "medicine-men" of savage tribes profess to have any such power. Elijah, indeed, "prayed, and the heaven gave rain" (<a href="../../par/james/5-18.htm">James 5:18</a>); but this was a very different thing from "commanding the clouds of heaven."

But there is great difficulty in supposing a sudden transition from clouds and lightning in vers. 34, 35 to the human understanding in ver. 36, <span class="accented">with a return to clouds and rain</span> in ver. 37. Hence many of the best critics understand ver. 36 of the purpose and intelligence that may be regarded as existing in the clouds and rain and lightning themselves, which are God's ministers, and run to and fro at his command, and execute his pleasure. (So Schultens, Rosenmuller, Professor Lee, and Professer Stanley Leathes.) To obtain this result, we must translate the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> By "tempest" or "thunder-belts," and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;</span>, in the next clause, by "storm n or something similar (see the Revised Version, where "dark clouds" is suggested as an alternative for "inward parts'" and "meteor" as an alternative for "heart").
