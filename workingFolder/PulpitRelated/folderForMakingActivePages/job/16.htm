There was nothing new in the second speech of Eliphaz, if we except its increased bitterness. Job had heard all the commonplaces about the universal sinfulness of man, and the invariable connection between sin and suffering, a thousand times before. It was the traditional belief in which he and all those about him had been brought up. But it brought him no relief. The reiteration of it only made him feel that there was neither comfort nor instruction to be got from his so-called "comforters." Hence his outburst. <span class="cmt_word">Miserable comforters are ye all!</span>

Will his friends never bring their futile speaking to  a close? <span class="cmt_word">Or what emboldeneth thee that thou anwerest?</span> rather, <span class="accented">what provoketh</span> thee? (Revised Version) Job had begged that his friends would be silent (<a href="../../par/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5, 13</a>). He supposes that they would have complied with his wish if he had not provoked them, but professes an inability to see what provocation he had given. His last speech, however, had certainly not been conciliatory (see <a href="../../par/job/12-1.htm">Job 12:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4, 7</a>, etc.).

If you were in my place and condition, and I in yours, I could moralize in your tone and spirit for hours. <span class="cmt_word">And shake my head at you</span>. A Hebrew mode of expressing condemnation of a man's conduct (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>, etc.).

The meaning is somewhat doubtful, and different renderings have been proposed. But the rendering of the Authorized Version is quite defensible, and is accepted by our Revisers. This gives the sense, "I, if I were in your place, would not act as you have acted, but, on the contrary, would do my best to strengthen you with words of comfort and encouragement." <span class="cmt_word">The moving of my lips should assuage your grief.</span> (So Rosenmuller and our Revisers.) The words are a covert reproach of the three "friends" for not acting as Job declares that he would have acted if the positions had been reversed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-6.htm">Job 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and <i>though</i> I forbear, what am I eased?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased!</span> As it is, nor speech nor silence are of any avail. Neither of them brings me any relief. My sufferings continue as before, whichever course I take. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span>. These words mark a transition. Job turns from complaints against his "comforters" to an enumeration of his own sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">He hath made me weary</span>. God has afflicted him with an intolerable sense of weariness. He is tired of life; tired of disputing with his friends; tired even of pouring out his lamentations and complaints and expostulations to God. His one desire is rest. So I have seen in the <span class="accented">piombi</span> of Venice, where political prisoners were tortured by cold and heat, and hunger and thirst, for long weeks or months, and brought to despair, such scratchlags as the following: "Luigi A. implora pace, Giuseppe B. implore eterna quiete." Job has entreated for this boon of rest repeatedly (<a href="../../par/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-18.htm">Job 10:18</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast made desolate all my company</span>. The loss of his children has desolated his household; his other afflictions have alienated his friends. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, <i>which</i> is a witness <i>against me</i>: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast filled me with wrinkles</span>. So St. Jerome, Professor Lee, Dr. Stanley Leathes, and others; but the generality of modern commentators prefer the rendering, "Thou hast bound me fast," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> deprived me of all power of resisting or moving (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8</a>, "I am so fast in prison that I cannot get forth"). Which is a witness against me; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a witness of thy displeasure, and so (as men suppose) of my guilt. <span class="cmt_word">And my leanness rising up in me heareth witness to my face</span>; rather, <span class="accented">my</span> <span class="accented">leanness rising up against me.</span> This emaciation is taken as another witness of his extreme sinfulness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">He teareth <i>me</i> in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">his wrath teareth</span> <span class="accented">and he hateth me.</span> God treats Job as severely as if he hated him. That he is actually hated of God Job does not believe; otherwise he would long since have ceased to call upon him, and pour out his heart before him. He gnasheth upon me with his teeth (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/35-16.htm">Psalm 35:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>). Mine enemy (or rather, <span class="accented">adversary</span>) sharpeneth his eyes upon me; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> makes me a whetstone on which he sharpens his angry glances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have gaped upon me with their mouth</span>. The "man of sorrows" of the Old Testament is, in many respects, a type of the "Man of sorrows" of the New; and, in the Messianic psalms, David constantly applies to Christ expressions which Job had used in reference to himself (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>). They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22</a>). They have gathered themselves together against me (see <a href="../../par/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>, and compare, in illustration of the literal and historical sense, <a href="../../par/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1, 10-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God hath delivered me to the ungodly</span>. All that Job had suffered at the hands of wicked men, the gibes of his "comforters," the insults and "derision ' of "base men" (<a href="../../par/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1, 8-10</a>), the desertion of many who might have been expected to have come to his aid, being by God's per-minion, is attributed by Job to God himself, who has "delivered" him up to these "ungodly" ones, and permits them to add to and intensify his sufferings. He was not so ruthlessly treated as his great Anti-type; he was not bound with thongs, or crowned with thorns, or smitten with a reed, or scourged, or crucified - even the smiting on the cheek, spoken of in ver. 10, was probably metaphorical; but he suffered, no doubt, grievously, through the scorn and contumely that assailed him, through his friends' unkindness, and his enimies'  insolent triumph, and the rude jeers of the "<span class="accented">abjeets</span>" who made him their "song" and their "byword" (<a href="../../par/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And turned me over into the hands of the wicked</span>. Job speaks as if God had wholly given him up, made him over to the wicked, to deal with him exactly as they chose. This, of course, was not so. If the malevolence of Satan was limited by the Divine will (<a href="../../par/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-6.htm">Job 2:6</a>); so, much more, would the malevolence of man be limited. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-12.htm">Job 16:12</a></div><div class="verse">I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken <i>me</i> by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was at ease</span> (compare the picture drawn in <a href="../../par/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1-5</a>). Job had been "at ease," tranquil, prosperous, happy. He had been almost without a care, when suddenly "trouble came." <span class="cmt_word">But he hath broken me asunder</span>; rather, he brake me <span class="accented">asunder</span> (see the Revised Version). In the midst of his ease and tranquillity, God suddenly poured out his chastisements, and "brake Job asunder," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> destroyed his life, ruined it and broke it down. <span class="cmt_word">He hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces</span>; or, <span class="accented">dashed me to pieces. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And set me up for his mark</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a target for his arrows (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>; <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-12.htm">Lamentations 3:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a></div><div class="verse">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His archers compass me round about</span>. God is represented, not as himself the shooter of the arrows, but as surrounding Job with a body of archers, who are under his command and carry out his will. So, generally, Scripture represents the judgments of God as carried out by interior agents (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare</span>. The allusion is probably to Job's physical sufferings, which included severe pains in the lumbar region. He poureth out my gall upon the ground. The rupture of the gallbladder causes the contents to be sprit upon the ground. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-14.htm">Job 16:14</a></div><div class="verse">He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He breaketh me with breach upon breach</span>. As an enemy, when he besieges a town, crushes its resistance by means of "breach upon breach." so is Job crushed by one attack after another. He runneth upon me like a giant; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with overwhelming force - a force that is quite irresistible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a></div><div class="verse">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin</span>. Another transition. Job turns to the consideration of how he has acted under his severe afflictions. In the first place, he has put on sackcloth, not for a time merely, as ordinary mourners do, but for a permanency, so that he may be said to have sewn it to his skin. There is, perhaps, also an allusion to the adhesion of the garment to his many sores. <span class="cmt_word">And have defiled my horn in the dust</span>. "My horn" is equivalent to "my pride," "my dignity." Job, when he left his state, and put on sackcloth, and "sat down among the ashes" (<a href="../../par/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>), denuded himself of his honour and dignity, and as it were trailed them in the dust 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a></div><div class="verse">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids <i>is</i> the shadow of death;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My face is foul with weeping</span> He has wept so much that his face is stained with his tears. <span class="cmt_word">And on my eyelids is the shadow of death</span>. There is an awful shadow on his eyes and eyelids, portending death

Job repudiates the charge of rapine and robbery which Eliphaz has brought against him (<a href="../../par/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28, 34</a>). His hands have not done violence to any. <span class="cmt_word">Also my prayer is pure</span>. Neither has he been guilty of the hypocrisy which Eliphaz has also charged him with (<a href="../../par/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a>). His prayers have been sincere and genuine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18</a></div><div class="verse">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O earth, cover not thou my blood!</span> There was a widespread belief in the ancient world that innocent blood, spilt upon the ground, cried to God for vengeance, and remained a dark blot upon the earth till it was avenged, or until it was covered up. Job apostrophizes the earth, and be-seethes it not to cover up his blood when he dies, as he expects to do, shortly. <span class="cmt_word">And let my cry have no place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let it have no hiding-place, but fill earth and heaven. Let it continue to be heard until it is answered.

Job claims God for his Witness, looks to him for an ultimate vindication of his character, is sure that in one way or another he will make his righteousness clear as the noonday in the sight of men and angels (see <a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>, of which this is in some sort an anticipation). <span class="cmt_word">My record</span> - or, he <span class="accented">that vouches for me</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">is on high</span> - one of the so frequent pleonastic repetitions of one and the same idea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-20.htm">Job 16:20</a></div><div class="verse">My friends scorn me: <i>but</i> mine eye poureth out <i>tears</i> unto God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My friends scorn me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my scorners are my companions</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have to live with those who scorn me (comp. ch. 30:1-13). <span class="cmt_word">But mine eye poureth out tears unto God</span>. It is not to his "friends" or "companions," or "comforters," or any human aid, that Job turns in his distress. God alone is his Refuge. Forced by his woes to pass his time in weeping and mourning (see ver. 16), it is to God that his heart turns, to God that he "pours out his tears." Hardly as he thinks God to have used him, bitterly as he sometimes ventures to complain, yet the idea never crosses him of looking for help or sympathy to any other quarter, of having recourse to any other support or stay. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (<a href="../../par/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>), expresses the deepest feeling of his heart, the firmost principle of  his nature. Nothing overrides it. Even "out of the depths" his soul cries to the Lord (see <a href="../../par/psalms/130-1.htm">Psalm 130:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a></div><div class="verse">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man <i>pleadeth</i> for his neighbour!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that one might plead for a man with God!</span> The original here is obscure. It may mean, <span class="accented">Oh that he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God himself) <span class="accented">would plead for a man with God! i.e.</span> would become a Mediator between himself and man, plead for him, undertake his defence, and obtain for him merciful consideration. Or, nearly as in the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Oh that one might plead for man</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> mankind at large) <span class="accented">with God!</span> interest him on their behalf, and obtain a merciful judgment for them. The former rendering is to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">As a man pleadeth for his neighbour</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a son of man</span> (or, as <span class="accented">the Son of man</span>) <span class="accented">pleadeth for his neighbour.</span> If we take the simpler rendering, "as a son of man," then the meaning is simply, "Oh that God would plead for man with himself, as a man is wont to plead for his fellow-man!" But if we prefer the other rendering, "as the Son of man," a Messianic interpretation will be necessary. (So Professor Lee and Dr. Stanley Leathes) But Messianic interpretations of passages that do not require them, and that have no such traditional interpretation, require extreme caution.
