This opening presents to us the Book of Job as a detached work, separate from and independent of all others. The historical books are generally united each to each by the <span class="accented">you</span> connective. In the land of Us. Uz, or Huz (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e5;</span>), seems to have been originally, like Judah, Moab, Ammon, Edom, etc., the name of a man. It was borne by a son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>), and again by a son of Dishan, the son of Seir the Horite (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-28.htm">Genesis 36:28</a>). Some regard it as also a personal name in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. But from this use it passed to the descendants of one or more of these patriarchs, and from them to the country or countries which they inhabited. The "land of Uz" is spoken of, not only in this passage, but also in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a> and <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>. These last-cited places seem to show that Jeremiah's "land of Uz" was in or near Edom, and therefore south of Palestine; but as Uzzites, like so many nations of these ports, were migratory, we need not be surprised if the name Uz was, at different times, attached to various localities. Arabian tradition regards the region of the Hauran, north-east of Palestine, as Job's country. The other geographical names in the Book of Job point to a more eastern location, one not far remote from the southern Euphrates, and the adjacent parts of Arabia Sheba, Dedan, Teman, Buz, Shuah, and Chesed (Casdim) all point to this locality. On the other hand, there is a passage in the inscriptions of Asshur-banipal (circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 650-625</span>) which, associating together the names of Huz and Buz (Khazu and Bazu), appears to place them both in Central Arabia, not far from the Jebel Shnmmar ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 470). My own conclusion would be that, while the name "land of Uz" designated at various periods various localities, Job's "land of Uz" lay a little west of the Lower Euphrates, on the borders of Chaldea and Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name was Job</span>. In the Hebrew the name is "Iyyob," whence the "Eyoub" of the Arabs and the "Hiob" of the Germans. It is quite a distinct name from that of the third son of Issachar (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-18.htm">Genesis 46:18</a>), which is properly expressed by "Job," being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>. <span class="accented">Iyyob is</span> supposed to be derived from <span class="accented">aib</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span>), "to be hostile," and to mean "cruelly or hostilely treated," in which ease we must suppose it to have been first given to the patriarch in his later life, and to have superseded some other, as "Peter" superseded "Simon," and "Paul" superseded  "Saul." According to a Jewish tradition, adopted by some of the Christian Fathers, Job's original name was "Jobab," and under this name he reigned as King of Edom (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>). But this kingship is scarcely compatible with the view given of him in the Book of Job. The supposed connection of the name of Juba with that of Job is very doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">And that man was perfect</span><span class="accented">. Tam</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), the word translated "perfect," seems to mean "complete, entire, not wanting in any respect," It corresponds to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">integer</span> (comp. Horace, 'Od.,' 1:22. 1, "Integer vitro, scelerisque purus'). It does not mean" absolutely sinless," which Job was not (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>; <a href="../../par/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>). And upright. This is the exact meaning of <span class="accented">yashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). "The Book of Jasher" was "the Book of the Upright" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>). One that feared God, and eschewed evil; literally, <span class="accented">fearing God and departing from evil</span>. The same testimony is given of Job by God himself in ver. 8, and again in <a href="../../par/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a> (comp. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>). We must suppose Job to have reached as near perfection as was possible tot man at the time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters</span>. The numbers three and seven, and their product, ten, are certainly sacred numbers, regarded as expressive of ideal perfection. But this does not prevent their being also historical. As Canon Cook observes, "Striking coincidences between outward facts and ideal numbers are not uncommon in the purely historical portions of Scripture" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 20). There are <span class="accented">twelve</span> apostles, <span class="accented">seventy</span> (7 &times; 10) disciples sent out by our Lord, <span class="accented">seven</span> deacons, three synoptic Gospels, <span class="accented">twelve</span> minor prophets, seven princes of Persia and Media, ten sons of Haman, three of Noah, Gomer, Terah, Levi, and Zeruiah, <span class="accented">seven</span> of Japhet, Mizraim, Seir the Horite, Gad, and Jesse (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13-15</a>), <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Ishmael, <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Jacob, etc. Our Lord is <span class="accented">thirty</span> (3 x 10) years old when he begins to teach, and his ministry lasts <span class="accented">three</span> years; he heals <span class="accented">seven</span> lepers, casts out of Mary Magdalene <span class="accented">seven</span> devils, speaks upon the cross <span class="accented">seven</span> "words," bids Peter forgive his brother "<span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven," etc. It is thus not only in vision or in prophecy, or in symbolical language, that these "ideal numbers" come to the front far more frequently than ethers, but also in the most matter-of-fact histories. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His substance also</span>; literally, <span class="accented">his acquisition</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">acquirere</span>), but used of wealth generally. <span class="cmt_word">Seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses</span>. Note, first of all, the absence of horses or mules from this list - an indication of high antiquity. Horses were not known in Egypt till the time of the shepherd-kings (about  <span class="date">B.C. 1900-1650</span>), who introduced them from Asia. None are given to Abraham by the Pharaoh contemporary with him (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>). We hear of none as possessed by the patriarchs in Palestine; and, on the whole, it is not probable that they had been known in Western Asia very long before their introduction into Egypt. They are natives of Central Asia, where they are still found wild, and passed gradually by exportation to the more southern regions, Armenia, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Arabia. Note, secondly, that the items of Job's wealth accord with those of Abraham's (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>). Thirdly, note that Job's wealth in cattle is not beyond credibility. An Egyptian lord of the time of the fourth dynasty relates that he possessed above 1000 oxen and cows, 974 sheep, 2,235 goals, and 760 asses (Rawlinson's 'Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 88). Further, the proportion of the camels is noticeable, and implies a residence on the borders of the desert (see the comment on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">and a very great household</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and a very great service</span>, or <span class="accented">retinue of servants.</span> Oriental emirs and sheikhs consider it necessary for their dignity to maintain a number of attendants and retainers (except, perhaps, in feudal times) quite unknown to the West. Abraham had three hundred and eighteen trained servants, born in his house (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). Egyptian households were "full of domestics," comprising attendants of all kinds - grooms, artisans, clerks, musicians, messengers, and the like. A sheikh, situated as Job was, would also require a certain number of guards, while for his cattle he would need a large body of shepherds, ox-herds, and the like (see Birch's 'Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 44<span class="cmt_word">). So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east</span>. The <span class="accented">Beney Kedem</span>, or "men of the east," literally, <span class="accented">sons of the east</span>, seems to include the entire population between Palestine and the Euphrates (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>, etc.). Many tribes of Arabs are similarly designated at the present day, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Beni Harb, the Beni Suhr, the Bani Naim, the Bani Lain, etc. It would seem that the Phoenicians must have called themselves Beni Kedem when they settled in Greece, since the Greeks knew them as "Cadmeisns," and made them descendants of a mythic "Cadreus' (Herod., 5:57-59). The name "Saracens" is to some extent analogous, since it means "Men of the morning." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And his sons went and feasted <i>in their</i> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his sons went and feasted</span>. "Went and feasted" seems to mean "were  in the habit of feastlng" (Rosenmuller, Lee). In their houses. Each had his own residence, and the residence was not a tent, but a" house." Job and his sons were not mere nomads, but belonged to the settled population. The same is implied by the "ploughing of the oxen" (ver. 14), and indeed by Job's "yoke of oxen" in ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">Every one his day</span>. Most commentators regard these feasts as birthday festivities. Each son in his turn, when his birthday arrived, entertained his six brothers. Others think that each of the seven brothers had his own special day of the week on which, he received his brothers at his table, so that the feasting was continuous. But this scarcely suits the context. And it is admitted that "his day" (in <a href="../../par/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>) means "his birthday." The celebration of birthdays by means of a feast was a very widespread custom in the East (see <a href="../../par/genesis/40-20.htm">Genesis 40:20</a>; Herod., 1:133; 9:110; <a href="../../par/mark/14-21.htm">Mark 14:21</a>). And sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. This by itself is sufficient to show that the feasts were occasional, not continuous. Constant absence of daughters, day after day, from the parental board is inconceivable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it was so, when the days of <i>their</i> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings <i>according</i> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when the days of the feasting had come round</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the birthdays had arrived in due course, and the feasting had taken place. That Job sent and sanctified them. In the old world, outside the Mosaic Law, the father of the family was the priest, to whom alone it belonged to bless, purify, and offer sacrifice. Job, after each birthday-feast, sent, it would seem, for his sons, and purified them by the accustomed ablutions, or possibly by some other ceremonial process, regarding it as probable that, in the course of their feasting, they had contracted some defilement. It would seem by the next clause that the purification took place at the close of the day of festivity. <span class="cmt_word">And rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings</span>. Burnt offerings were instituted soon after the Fall, as we learn from <a href="../../par/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>, and were in common use long before the Mosaic Law was given (see <a href="../../par/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 20, 21; vol. 12. pp. 49, 71, etc.). The practice was common, so far as appears, to all the nations of antiquity, except the Persians (Herod., 1:132). According to the number of them all One, apparently, for each child, since each might have sinned in the way suggested. The offerings were clearly it. tended as expiatory. <span class="cmt_word">For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts</span>. Two wholly different meanings are assigned by good Hebraists to the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. According to some, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has its usual sense, "to bless," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> signifies "false gods," or "idols;" according to the others, who form the great majority, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> has its usual sense of "God," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has the unusual sense of "curse" (so Buxtorf, Rosenmuller, Schultens, (Cook, Stanley Leathes, among moderns, and among ancient authorities, the Septuagint and the Vulgate). How the same word comes to have the two wholly opposite senses of "to bless" and "to curse" has been differently explained. Some think that, as men blessed their friends both on receiving them and on bidding them adieu, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> got the sense of "bidding adieu to," "dismissing," "renouncing." Others regard the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> for "to curse" as a mere euphemism, and compare the use of <span class="accented">sacer</span> and <span class="accented">sacrari</span> in Latin, and such expressions as "<span class="accented">Bless</span> the stupid man!" "What a <span class="accented">blessed</span> nuisance!" in English. The maledictory sense seems to be established by <a href="../../par/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a> and <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>. By "cursing God in their hearts" Job probably means "forgetting him," "putting him out of sight," "not giving him the honour which is his due." <span class="cmt_word">Thus did Job continually</span>; literally, as in the margin, <span class="accented">all the days</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the festival-days occurred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord</span>. By "the sons of God" it is generally admitted that, in this place, the angels are meant (so again in <a href="../../par/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>). The meaning of the phrase is probably different in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. Angels and men are alike "sons of God," as created by him, in his image, to obey and serve him. Christ, the "Only Begotten," is his Son in quite a different sense. We may gather, perhaps, from this place and <a href="../../par/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a> that there are fixed times at which the angelic host, often sent out by the Almighty on distant errands, has to gather together, one and all, before the great white throne, to pay homage to their Lord, and probably to give an account of their doings<span class="cmt_word">. And Satan came also among them</span>. The word "Satan" has the article prefixed to it <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> here and elsewhere in Job, as in <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a> and in <a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. Thus accompanied, it is less a proper name than an appellative - "the adversary" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, without the article, it is undoubtedly a proper name, as in the New Testament, <span class="accented">passim</span>. Accusation of men before God is one of the special offices of the evil spirit (see <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>), who is "the accuser of the brethren, he that accuses  them before God day and night" (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>). The accusations that he makes may be either true or false, but they are so often false that his ordinary New Testament name is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Slanderer." The existence of an evil spirit must have been known to all who read or heard the story of the fall of man (<a href="../../par/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.), and the descriptive epithet, "the Adversary," is likely to have been in use from a very early date. The notion that the Satan of the Old Testament is a reflex of the Persian Ahriman, and that the Jews derived their belief upon the subject from the Persians, is quite untenable. The character and position of Satan in the Hebrew system are quite unlike those of Ahriman (<span class="accented">Angro-mainyus</span>) in the religion of the Zoroastrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 104-113).

He searches the whole earth continually, never passing, never resting, but "going about<span class="accented"></span>," as St. Peter says (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>), "like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour," waiting till the coming of the "thousand years," when an angel will "bind him with a great chain, and cast him into the bottom-less pit" (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 2</a>).

He serves God, not for love of God, or for love of goodness, but for what he gets by it. Satan is too shrewd to endeavour, as Job's friends do later, to pick holes in Job's conduct. No; that is exemplary. But the true character of acts is determined by the motive. What is Job's motive? Does he not serve God to gain his protection and blessing? Similarly, in modern times, ungodly men argue that religious and devout persons are religious and devout with a view to their own interest, because they expect to gain by it, either in this world, or in the next, or in both. This is a form of calumny which it is impossible to escape. And bad men, who are conscious to themselves of never acting except from a selfish motive, may well imagine the same of others. It is rarely that such an insinuation can be disproved. In the present instance God vindicates his servant, and covers the adversary with shame, as the other adversaries and calumniators of righteousness will be covered at the last day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast not thou made an hedge about him?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "hedged him around, protected him, made a sort of invisible fence about him, through which no evil could creep." This was undoubtedly true. God had so protected him. But the question was not as to this fact, but as to Job's motive. Was it mere prudence? - the desire to secure a continuance of this protection? <span class="cmt_word">And about his house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his family" - his sons and daughters - the members of his household. <span class="cmt_word">And about all that he hath on every side</span>. His possessions - land, houses, cattle, live stock of all kinds, furniture, goods and chattels. Thou hast blessed the work of his hands (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where it is said of the righteous man. that "whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper"). So it was with Job. God's blessing was upon him, and success crowned all his enterprises. "The work of his hands" will include everything that he attempted. <span class="cmt_word">And his substance is increased in the land</span>. In the former clause we have the cause, God's blessing; in the latter the effect, a great increase in Job's "substance," or "cattle" (marginal reading). (On the final number of his cattle, see ver. 3.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But put forth thine hand now</span>; literally, <span class="accented">send forth thy hand</span>, as a man does who strikes a blow (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/22-12.htm">Genesis 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/9-15.htm">Exodus 9:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And touch all that he hath</span>; or, <span class="accented">smite all that he hath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ruin him, strip him of his possessions. And he will curse thee to thy face. Professor  Lee translates, "If not, he will bless thee to thy face;" the LXX., "Surely he will bless thee to thy face;" Canon Cook, "See if he will not renounce thee openly." But the majority of Hebraists agree with the Authorized Version. Satan suggests that, if Job be stripped of his possessions, he will openly curse God, and renounce his worship. Here he did not so much calumniate, or lie, as show the evil thoughts that were in his own heart. No doubt he believed that Job would act as he said. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath <i>is</i> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.

God withdraws his protection from Job's possessions; he does not himself take them away, as Satan had suggested (ver. 11); but he allows Satan, who can do nothing without his allowance, to deal with them as he pleases. As God dispenses blessings through the angelic host (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), so he, sometimes at any rate, allows spirits of evil to be the ministers of his chastisements. <span class="cmt_word">Only upon himself put not forth thine hand</span>. The <span class="accented">person</span> of Job was not to be touched as yet. He was to be injured only in his belongings. <span class="cmt_word">So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord</span>. Having obtained a permission which he thought would serve his purpose, Satan did not delay, but promptly departed, to take advantage of the permission given him. To be in the presence of God must be an intense pain to the evil one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house</span>. One of the birthdays, the eldest brother's probably, had come round, and the ordinary gathering (see ver. 4) had taken place - the feasting and drinking had begun, while the father, remaining in his own house, was perhaps interceding with God for his children, or anxiously considering the possibility that, in their light-hearted merriment, they might have put God away altogether from their thoughts, and So have practically renounced him, when the series of calamities began. How often calamity comes to us when we are least expecting it, when all seems quiet about us, when everything is prospering - nay, even when a high festival-time has come, and the joy-bells are sounding in our ears, and our 'hearts are elated within us! Job was, at any rate, spared the sudden plunge from exuberant joy into the depths of woe. It was his habit to preserve an even temper, and neither to be greatly exalted, nor, unless under an extremity of suffering, to be greatly depressed. He was now, however, about to be subjected to a fiery trial.

Note that, notwithstanding the festival, labour was still going on; there was no general holiday; the oxen were at work in the field, not perhaps all of them, but the greater number, for the ploughing-time is short in the Oriental countries, and the "earing" is all done at the same time. The bulk of Job's labourers were probably engaged in the business, and they had brought the asses with them, probably to keep them under their eye, lest thieves should carry them off, when the catastrophe related in the next verse occurred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the Sabeans fell <i>upon them</i>, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Sabeans</span> (literally, Sheba) <span class="cmt_word">fell upon them, and took them away</span>. The Sabeans were the principal people of Arabia in ancient times, and the name seems to be used sometimes in the general sense of "Arabs" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>). We may suppose that hem, either the general sense is intended, or, if the specific one, then that, at the date whereto the story of Job belongs, there were Sabeans in Eastern as well as in Southern Arabia, in the neighbourhood of the Upper Persian Gulf as well as in the neighbourhood of the Indian Ocean. The plundering habits of all the Arab tribes are well known. Strabo says that the Sabeans, even at the height of their prosperity, made excursions for the sake of plunder into Arabia Petraea and even Syria (Strab., 16:4) <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have slain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they slew</span>, or <span class="accented">they smote. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the labourers who were engaged in ploughing, and would be in duty bound to resist the carrying off of the cattle. <span class="cmt_word">With the edge of the sword</span>.

This Satan, under permission, might wield, as being "the prince of the power of the air" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>): but there is, no doubt, something very extraordinary in a storm extending over the pastures occupied by nine thousand sheep, and destroying the whole of them (Cook)  Still, it cannot be said that such a storm is impossible; and perhaps the damage done was not greater than that which followed on the seventh Egyptian plague (see <a href="../../par/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And hath burned up the sheep, and the servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shepherds who were in attendance upon the sheep. <span class="cmt_word">And consumed them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">devoured them.</span> Fire is often said to "devour" what it destroys.

The exact repetition of a clause, without the alteration of a word or a letter, is very archaic (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31</a>; and for another repetition, <a href="../../par/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And said, The Chaldeans</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Casdim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), which is the word uniformly used in the Hebrew where the Authorized Version has "Chaldeans" or "Chaldees." The native name seems to have been <span class="accented">Kaldi</span> or <span class="accented">Kaldai</span>, whence the Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">Chaldaei.</span> It is very difficult to account for the Hebrews having substituted a sibilant for the liquid; but it was certainly done from the earliest period of their literature (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>) to the latest (see Targums, <span class="accented">passim</span>). Some derive the Hebrew <span class="accented">Casdim</span> from "Chesed," one of the sons of Nahor (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-22.htm">Genesis 22:22</a>); but Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees before Chesed was born (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>). And there is no evidence of any connection between Chesed, who was born at Haran, and the Babylonian Chaldeans. The Chaldeans were probably early settlers in Babylonia; by degrees they were pressed to the south, and gave the name of Chaldea to Lower Babylonia, or the tract nearest to the Persian Gulf (Strab., 16:1, &sect; 66; Ptolemy, 'Geographia,' 5:20). From a remote date they were a settled and civilized people; but no doubt originally they had the same predatory instincts as their neighbours<span class="cmt_word">. Made out three bands</span>. Professor Lee translates, "appointed three captains," which is a possible meaning of the words; but the weight of authority supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">And fell upon the camels</span>. Perhaps the most valuable part of Job's possessions. Three thousand camels would be regarded as a splendid capture by any body of Oriental marauders. <span class="cmt_word">And have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants</span> (literally, the <span class="accented">young men</span>, as in ver. 16) <span class="cmt_word">with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee</span> (compare the comment on ver. 15).

It is a common proverb that "misfortunes never come singly." Shakespeare says they "come not single foes, but in battalions." Still, so overwhelming a series of calamities falling upon a single individual all in one day could not but strike those who heard of them as abnormal, and almost certainly supernatural. So Job's friends concluded (<a href="../../par/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from across the wilderness</span> - a wind which began in the region lying on the other side of the wilderness, and sweeping across it, came with full force upon the inhabited tract where Job and his sons were dwelling. The desert winds are often very violent. Generally they are Laden with heavy clouds of fine sand, which cause intolerable discomfort and thirst; but when they sweep over a rocky and gravelly region, they are simply of extreme violence, without other distressing feature. They then resemble the hurricanes or tornadoes of the West Indies. We may reasonably connect this hurricane with the thunderstorm of ver. 16<span class="cmt_word">. And smote the four corners of the house, and it fell.</span> The "houses" of the East are not the solid structures of heavy timber, brick, and stone to which we of the West are accustomed, but light fabrics of planks and palisades, thatched mostly with reeds.

Not till the last calamity was announced did Job stir. The loss of his wealth little moved him.

After giving vent to his natural grief, Job made an act of adoration. Recognizing the fact that adversity, as well as prosperity comes from God, and submitting himself to the Divine will, he "worshipped." How often has his act flashed across the minds of Christians. and enabled them, in their dark hour, to imitate him, and repeat his words, "The Lord gave," etc.! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither</span>. There is some difficulty in the word "thither," since no man returns to his mother's womb (<a href="../../par/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>), at death or otherwise. The expression must not be pressed. It arises out of the analogy, constantly felt and acknowledged, between "mother" earth and a man's actual mother (setup. Psalm 129:15). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away</span>. Job is here represented as knowing God by his name "Jehovah," though elsewhere the "great Name" appears once only in the words of Job (<a href="../../par/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>), and never in the words of his friends. The natural <span class="accented">conclusion is</span> that the name was known in the land of Uz at the time, but was very rarely used - scarcely, except in moments of excitement. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Name of the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">may the Name of Jehovah be blessed!</span> The ermphatic word is kept for the last. According to Satan, Job was to have" cursed God to his face" (ver. 11). The event is that he openly and resolutely blesses God. That the same word is used in its two opposite senses rather accentuates the antithesis.
