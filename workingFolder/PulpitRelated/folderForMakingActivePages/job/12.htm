The special point, in Job's mind, seems to be God's complete mastery over the world, and absolute control over all that takes place in it (see the introductory paragraph).

Having set at rest the personal question between himself and his friends, Job reverts to his main argument, and maintains that, the whole course of mundane events being under God's governance, all the results are to be attributed to him, and among them both the prosperity of the wicked, and, by parity of reasoning, the sufferings of the righteous. <span class="cmt_word">And they that provoke God are secure</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly</span>. So both the Authorized and the Revised Versions; but recent critics mostly render, "who bring their God in their hand," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "who regard their own right hand as their God" (comp. Virgil, 'Aen., 10:773, "Dextra mihi Dens") 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/12-7.htm">Job 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee</span>. Job here begins his review of all creation, to show that God has the absolute direction of it. The order of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> beasts, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> birds, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> fishes, is that of dignity (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7, 8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Job maintains that, if appeal were made to the animal creation, and they were asked their position with respect to God, they would with one voice proclaim him their absolute Ruler and Director. <span class="cmt_word">And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee</span>. The instincts of birds, their periodical migrations, their inherited habits, are as wonderful as anything in the Divine economy of the universe, and as much imply God's continually directing hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/12-8.htm">Job 12:8</a></div><div class="verse">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee</span>. If the material earth be intended, the appeal must be to its orderly course, its summers and winters, its seedtime and harvest, its former and latter rains, its constant productivity, which, no less than animal instincts, speak of a single ruling power directing and ordering all things. If the creeping things of the earth, the reptile creation, be meant, then the argument is merely an expansion of that in the preceding verse. The instincts of reptiles are to be ascribed, no less than those of beasts and birds, to the constant superintending action and providence of the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee</span>. The testimony will be unanimous - beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes will unite in it.

The writer probably regards the name as unfamiliar, if not unknown, to Job's neighbours, and therefore as avoided by him in his discussions with them. But here, for once, he forgets to be consistent with himself. Outside Scripture, the name is first found on the Moabite Stone (about  <span class="date">B.C. 890</span>), where it designates the God worshipped by the Israelites (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 11. p. 166, 1. 18). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">In whose hand <i>is</i> the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing</span>. A brief summary of what had been said in vers. 7, 8, to which is now appended the further statement, that in God's hand - wholly dependent on him - is the entire race of mankind also. <span class="cmt_word">And the breath of all mankind</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and the spirit of all flesh of man.</span>

In other words, "Is it not as much the business of the ear to discriminate between wise and unwise words, as of the palate to determine between pleasant and unpleasant tastes?" The bearing of the verse on the general argument is not clear.

Men get their wisdom gradually and painfully by much experience during a long stretch of time, so that it is not until they are" ancient" that we can call them wise or credit them with "understanding." But with God the case is wholly different.

With God wisdom and strength dwell essentially. He is not wiser or stronger at one time than at another. Time and experience add nothing to the perfection of his attributes, which are unchangeable. Such wisdom infinitely transcends any to which man can attain, and therefore is doubtless the wisdom whereby the world is governed. <span class="cmt_word">He hath counsel and understanding</span>. God <span class="accented">has</span> these qualities as his own. They are not acquired or imparted, but belong to him, necessarily and always.

Professor Lee thinks that the allusion is to the cities of the plain (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-29</a>). But the sentiment is so general, that we may well doubt if particular instances were in Job's mind. At any rate, the destructive agencies of nature must be as much included as any supernatural acts. He shutteth up a man (comp. <a href="../../par/job/11-10.htm">Job 11:10</a>). God "shuts up" men when be hedges them in with calamities or other circumstances, which take away from them all freedom of action (<a href="../../par/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>; <a href="../../par/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>) When he does this, the result follows -   <span class="cmt_word">There can be no opening</span>.

Once upon a time he overwhelmed the whole earth, and destroyed almost the entire race of mankind, by a deluge of an extraordinary character, which so fixed itself in the human consciousness, that traces of it are to be found in the traditions of almost all the various races of men. But, beside this great occasion, he also in ten thousand other cases, causes, by means of floods, tremendous ruin and devastation, sweeping away crops and cattle, and even villages and cities, sometimes even "overturning the earth," causing lakes to burst, rivers to change their course, vast tracts of land to be permanently submerged, and the contour of coasts to be altered.

Not only does God rule the course of external nature, but also the doings of men. "Shall there be evil in a city, and shall not he have done it?" (<a href="../../par/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>) He allows some to deceive, and others to be deceived. Moral evil is thus under his control, and, <span class="accented">in a certain</span> sense, may be celled his doing. But it behoves men, when they approach such great mysteries, to be very cautious and wary in their speech. Job touches with somewhat too bold a hand the deepest problems of the universe.

The wise of the earth cannot resist or escape him; he frustrates their designs and overthrows them, and, as it were, leads them away captive.

This may either mean that God at his pleasure both looses kings from captivity, and also binds them with a cord and causes them to be carried away captive; or that he looses the authority which kings have over their subjects, and then lets them be carried away captive by their enemies. The latter is perhaps the more probable sense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/12-19.htm">Job 12:19</a></div><div class="verse">He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He leadeth princes away spoiled</span>; rather, priests (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d4;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), as in the Revised Version. This is the only mention of "priests" in the Book of Job, and a priest-caste, such as that of Egypt or of Israel, can scarcely be meant. The priests are placed among the mighty, on a par with kings (ver. 18), princes (ver. 21), and "the strong" (ver. 21). This context makes us naturally think of those priest-kings whom we hear of in the olden times, such as were Melchizedek (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-18.htm">Genesis 19:18-20</a>) and Jethro (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-1.htm">Exodus 18:1-27</a>), and the Egyptian kings of the twenty-first dynasty ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 408-415), and Ethbaal of Tyro ('History of Phoenicia,' p. 435), and Sethos (Herod., 2, 141), and others. Job's allusion is probably to persons of this exalted class, who no doubt were sometimes defeated and dragged into captivity, like other rulers and governors. And overthroweth the mighty. Schultens understands by <span class="accented">ethanim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) "great teachers;" but the ordinary meaning of the word is "strong" or "mighty" (see <a href="../../par/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>).

By "deep things" are probably meant the "deeply laid schemes" which wicked men concoct in darkness (or secrecy). These God often "discovers," or causes to be laid bare. English history can point to such a case in the discovery of the famous "Gunpowder Plot" in the second year of King James I. <span class="cmt_word">And bringeth out to light the shadow of death</span>. There is nothing secret which God cannot, if he choose, reveal; nor is there anything hid which he cannot make known. Dark, murderous schemes, on which lies a shadow as of death, which men plan in secret, and keep hidden in their inmost thoughts, he can, and often does, cause to be brought to light and made manifest in the sight of all. Every such scheme, however carefully guarded and  concealed, shall be one day made known (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>).

With Israel, his "peculiar people" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), he especially concerned himself, but not with Israel only. Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, Elam, Edom, Ammon, Moab, were likewise objects of his attention, of his guidance, of his chastening hand, of his avenging rod. Particular nations were consigned by God to the charge of particular angels (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20</a>). At his pleasure he can "increase" nations by blessing them with extraordinary fecundity (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7-12</a>), or "destroy" them by internal decay, by civil wars, or by the swords of their neighbours. <span class="cmt_word">He enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "enlarges their bounds, or diminishes them."
