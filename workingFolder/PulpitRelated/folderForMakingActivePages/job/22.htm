After this weak prelude, however, there is more vigour in his assault. In vers. 4-9 he directly charges Job with a number of specified sins, and in vers. 10, 11 declares his sufferings to be the consequence of them. He then proceeds to accuse him of denying God's omniscience (vers. 12-14), and, alter some not very successful attempts to retort on him his own words (vers. 15-20), finally recurs to his favourite devices (see <a href="../../par/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17-26</a>) of exhorting Job to submission and repentance, and promising him restoration to God's favour and a return of prosperity (vers. 21-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, Can a man be profitable unto God?</span> Job had <span class="accented">said</span> nothing upon this point; but perhaps Eliphaz thinks his complaints and expostulations to <span class="accented">imply</span> a higher value in man, and a greater claim to consideration at God's hands, than can rightly be challenged. Certainly God does not depend on man for profit or advantage of any kind. Neither our wisdom nor our goodness "extendeth to him." As he that is wise may be profitable unto himself; rather, <span class="accented">truly he that is wise is profitable unto himself</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to himself only, and not to God.

He must have been guilty of almost every form of ill-doing. <span class="cmt_word">And thine iniquities infinite?</span> literally, <span class="accented">and is there not no end to thine iniquities?</span> These general conclusions seem to Eliphaz to justify him in proceeding to the enumeration of details.

We may, perhaps, gather from this that the Mosaic Law on the subject was founded on an anterior custom widely prevalent in SouthWestern Asia. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-7.htm">Job 22:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink</span>. To give water to the thirsty was regarded in the East as one of the most elementary duties of man to man. The self-justification of the dead in the Egyptian Hades contained the following passage: "I gave my bread to the hungry, <span class="accented">and drink to him that was athirst</span>; I clothed the naked with garments; I sheltered the wanderer" ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. CXXV. &sect; 38). The same claim appears continually on Egyptian tombs. "All men respected me," we read on one; "I <span class="accented">gave water to the thirsty</span>; I set the wanderer in his path; I took away the oppressor, and put a stop to violence" ('Non-Biblical Systems of Religion,' p. 46). In the proverbs assigned to Solomon, "which the men of Hezekiah copied out" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>), the duty was declared to be one owed even to enemies (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>, "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, <span class="accented">give him water to drink"</span>). Isaiah notices it as praiseworthy in the Temanites (Eliphaz's people), that they "<span class="accented">brought water to him that was thirsty</span> and prevented with their bread him that fled" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>). Jael is praised for going further than this: He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish" (<a href="../../par/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry</span>. Later on Job absolutely denies this, as well as many of the other charges. "If I have withheld," he says, "the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or <span class="accented">have eaten my morsel myself alone</span>, <span class="accented">and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof</span>," then let mine arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone" (<a href="../../par/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16-22</a>).

Job's retainers are probably meant, whom Eliphaz supposes to have been allowed by Job to oppress the poor, and have their own way in the world. This charge was doubtless as baseless as the others (comp. <a href="../../par/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16, 17</a>).

Job, on the contrary, declares that he "caused the widow s heart to sing for joy" (<a href="../../par/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>). The sin of oppressing widows was one of which Job deeply felt the heinousness.

Job had complained of the "darkness" that was "set in his paths" (<a href="../../par/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>), meaning probably his inability to discover the cause of his afflictions. <span class="cmt_word">And abundance of waters cover thee.</span> The comparison of severe affliction to an overwhelming flood is very common in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1-3, 14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>, etc.). So Shakespeare speaks of "a sea of troubles." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not God in the height of heaven?</span> From taxing Job with definite open sins, Eliphaz proceeds to accuse him of impious thoughts and principles. He  does not acknowledge, Eliphaz says, either the majesty or the omniscience of God. Here he has, at any rate, some tangible ground for his reproaches. Job's words have been over-bold, over-venturesome. He has seemed to forget the distance between God and man (<a href="../../par/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30-33</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, etc.), and to call in question either God's omniscience or his regard for moral distinctions (<a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-13, 23-26</a>). Hence Eliphaz is enabled to take a high tone and ask, "Hast thou forgotten that God is in the height of heaven, far up above all us poor wretched mortals? Dost thou need to be reminded of this? He is above the stars, and yet behold the height of the stars, how high they are! Even they are infinitely above men, yet how far below <span class="accented">him</span>!" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/35-5.htm">Job 35:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13</a></div><div class="verse">And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou sayest, How doth God know?</span> Job had not said this in so many words, but, by equalizing the godly and the wicked (<a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23-26</a>), he might be supposed to mean that God took no note of men's conduct, and therefore had not a perfect knowledge of all things. The psalmist implies that many men so thought (<a href="../../par/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Can he judge through the dark cloud?</span> rather, <span class="accented">through the thick darkness.</span> God was supposed to dwell remote from man, in the highest heaven, and, according to many, "clouds and darkness were round about him" (<a href="../../par/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>) - he "dwelt in the thick darkness" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>) - he "made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him was waters, and thick clouds of the skies" (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). The imagery was, no doubt, at first used in reference to man's inability to see and know God; but when men became familiar with it, they turned the metaphor round, and questioned God's ability to see and know anything about man. Job had not really ever shared in these doubts; but it suits Eliphaz's purpose to malign and misrepresent him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thick clouds <i>are</i> a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse); and he walketh in the circuit of heaven; or, on <span class="accented">the circumference of the heavens.</span> The heavens are regarded as a solid vault, <span class="accented">outside</span> which is the place where God dwells.

(see the Revised Version). Eliphaz assumes that it is Job's intention to cast in his lot with these persons whose prosperous wickedness he has described in the preceding chapter (vers. 7-15). And this notwithstanding Job's final protest, "Be the counsel of the wicked far from me" (ver. 16). He calls the mode of life pursued by these wicked persons "the old way," either with allusion to the seed of Cain before the Flood, who "corrupted their way" (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>), or perhaps with reference to the descendants of Nimrod after it (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' p. 361).

The idea is the same as that of <a href="../../par/job/21-15.htm">Job 21:15</a>, though not expressed so pointedly. What Eliphaz thinks to gain by echoing Job's words is not very apparent.

And the innocent laugh them to scorn (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>).

It is best to take these as the words of the righteous in their triumph over the wicked; but they can scarcely bear the interpretation given them in the Authorized Version. The clause is not really negative but affirmative, and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. does not  mean "substance," but "adversary."

Eliphaz turns away from reproaches, open or covert, designed to exhibit Job as an example of extreme wickedness, and falls back on those topics which were the main subjects of his first exhortation (<a href="../../par/job/5-8.htm">Job 5:8-27</a>), viz. an earnest appeal to Job to return to God, to repent and amend (vers. 21-23) and a lavish outpouring of promises, or prophecies, that in that case he should be delivered from all his troubles, should recover his wealth and prosperity, obtain of God all that he should pray for, succeed in all his enterprises, and be able to help and ease others, even those who might be guilty in God's sight (vers. 24-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Acquaint now thyself with him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God), <span class="accented">and be at peace</span>; or, make, <span class="accented">I beseech thee</span> <span class="accented">a trial of him</span>, <span class="accented">and be at peace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> risk everything, throw thyself upon his mercy, and so make thy peace with him. To do so is well worth thy while, for thereby good shall come unto thee. It is a question what sort of "good" is meant. If we are to explain the "good" of this passage by vers. 24, 25 exclusively, Eliphaz will become a mere utilitarian, and he will be rightly characterized as "selfish and sordid" (Cook) - an anticipation of the Mammon of Milton. But there seem to be no sufficient grounds for singling out vers. 24, 25 from the rest of the passage, and regarding them as forming its key-note. The "good" which Eliphaz promises to Job includes, besides "the gold of Ophir" and "plenty of silver," such things as "delight in the Almighty," and confident trust in him (ver. 26), God's hearing of his prayers (ver. 27), the shining of light upon his path (ver. 28), his own payment of his vows (ver. 27), his giving assistance to the poor and needy (ver. 29), and even his deliverance of the guilty by the pureness of his hands (ver. 30); so that other besides material considerations are clearly taken into account, and the worldly prosperity which Eliphaz promises forms a part only of the good result which he anticipates from the patriarch making his peace with the Almighty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-22.htm">Job 22:22</a></div><div class="verse">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth</span>; or, <span class="accented">receive now instruction from his mouth.</span> The supposition of some commentators, that the "Law of Moses" is intended, is negatived by the entire absence from the Book of any allusion to the details of the Mosaic legislation, as well as by the primitive character of the life depicted in the book, and the certainty that no one of the interlocutors is an Israelite. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>, without the article prefixed, is properly "instruction," and is only to be assumed as meaning "the Law" when the context shows this meaning to be probable. The "instruction" to which Eliphaz here points, and which he regards as instruction from God's mouth, is probably the teaching of religious men, such as himself, which he considered to have come from God originally, though, perhaps, he could not have explained how. <span class="cmt_word">And lay up his words in thine heart</span>. This is a mere variant of the preceding clause, and adds no fresh idea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-23.htm">Job 22:23</a></div><div class="verse">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou shalt return to the Almighty</span>. Eliphaz, like Bildad in <a href="../../par/job/8-5.htm">Job 8:5</a>, and Zophar in <a href="../../par/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13</a>, taxes Job with having fallen away from God, almost with having apostatized. All his prophecies of future prosperity rest upon the assumption that Job, having fallen away, is now about to turn to God, repent of his misdoings, and be again received with favour<span class="cmt_word">. Thou shall be built up</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "restored, re-established! <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14</a>, where Zophar implies that Job's tents have ill-gotten gains concealed in them).

"Ophir" stands, no doubt, for untold wealth, being the great gold- producing country (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; 1 Chronicles 29:41; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>). (On its location, see the article on "Ophir," in Smith's  'Dict. of the Bible,' vol 2. pp. 637-652, and compare the comment on Job 28:16.)

The general meaning of the passage seems to  be, "However rich thou mayest be in the precious metals, thy true treasure - that which thou wilt value most - will be the Almighty himself." <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt have plenty of silver</span>; or, <span class="accented">and he shall be previous silver unto thee</span> (see the Revised Version).

God shall no longer be a terror and alarm to thee, as he is at present (<a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17-20</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/19-6.htm">Job 19:6-13</a>, etc.), but a source of rejoicing and joy. Thou shalt have blessings at his hands instead of sufferings, rewards instead of punishments. Therefore shalt thou delight in him, and shalt lift up thy rites unto God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "shalt turn towards him, like the sunflower towards the sun, end bask in the light of his countenance." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-27.htm">Job 22:27</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee</span>. Now Job prays, but is not heard; he asks for death, but it does not come; he begs for a respite from suffering, but it is refused him; he beseeches God to enter into argument with him (<a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-34</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>), but God vouchsafes no answer. Let him follow Eliphaz's advice, "return to the Almighty" (ver. 23), humble himself in the dust, repent and "put away his iniquity" (ver. 23), and then, Eliphaz promises him, all shall be changed - God will become gracious to him, will listen to him, and grant his requests, will remove his heavy hand, and crown him with mercy and loving-kindness. Then, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt pay thy vows.</span> Thou shalt have wealth enough, and strength enough, to pay any vows that thou hast made, which now in thy afflicted state thou canst not do. Vows are part of natural religion, and were widely prevalent over all the East in ancient times. The performance of vows, which was strictly enjoined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>), must at all times have been felt as obligatory by the natural conscience. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-28.htm">Job 22:28</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee</span>. Whatever thou resolvest on, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, God shall ratify with his authority, and bring to pass in due time for thy benefit - a promise which has certainly "a touch of audacity" about it (Cook). David is less bold, but intends to give the same sort of encouragement when he says, "Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart; commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the light shall shine upon thy ways</span>. Job had complained of the "darkness" by which his path was shadowed (<a href="../../par/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>). Eliphaz promises that this cause of complaint shall be removed. Job's way shall be "made plain before his face." A bright light shall illumine it - a light that shall ever "shine more and more unto the perfect day" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>).

It is now generally admitted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> in this place is for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4</a>. The meaning seems to be that God will deliver, at Job's prayer, even guilty persons, who will be <span class="cmt_word">delivered by the pureness of Job's hands</span>. Eliphaz thus prophesies his own deliverance and that of his two friends from God's wrath at the intercession of Job, as actually came to pass afterwards (see <a href="../../par/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 21"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/23.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 23"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 23" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
