He begins by accusing Job of having spoken at undue length, and at the same time, boastfully and mockingly (vers. 2-4). He then expresses a wish that God would take Job at his word, and really answer him, since he is sure that the result would be to show that Job had been punished much less than he. deserved to be (vers. 5, 6). Job's complaints against the justice of God's dealings he meets by an assertion of God's unsearchableness and perfect wisdom, which he contrasts with the folly of man (ver. 7-12). Finally, he suggests that a stricken man, being guilty, should humble himself, put away his iniquity, and turn to God, in which ease he may expect a restoration to favour. Otherwise, he has only to look for wretchedness, failure, and despair (vers. 18-20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said</span> (see the comment on Job 2:11).

Job had certainly been somewhat unduly verbose, and laid himself open to the taunt here launched against him; but neither had brevity been studied by his other friends in their previous answers (ch. 4, 5, and 8.), nor is it greatly studied by Zophar here. <span class="cmt_word">And should a man full of talk be justified?</span> literally, <span class="accented">a man of lips</span> which may mean either "a great talker" or "a man who makes many professions." There is a widespread prejudice against a great orator, and a widespread notion that a good cause does net need many words.

And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed I It is not quite easy to see what in Job's speeches up to this point could be regarded as "mocking." But perhaps Zophar would have thus characterized the following passages: <a href="../../par/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13, 14, 25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22-24</a>.

Job had certainly not said this in so many words. In fact, he had not spoken of his "doctrine" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d7;</span>), nor had he called either his doctrine or his conduct absolutely pure (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span>). But, no doubt, he had maintained, in a certain sense, his innocency; not, indeed, his entire freedom from sin or guilt, but his honest endeavour to serve God and lead a good life. This was the real point disputed between him and his "comforters;" they argued, from his sufferings, that he must be a "chief sinner;" he maintained, from the testimony of his conscience, that he was free from all heinous sins<span class="cmt_word">. And I am clean in thine eyes</span> (see above, <a href="../../par/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a>).

Zophar wishes that he would reveal to Job this wisdom, or a portion of it, as, in that case, all his pride and self-confidence would be confounded and fall away. That they are double to that which is! This phrase is very obscure. Some translate, "For he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) is twice as wise as thou;" others, "That it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom) is manifold in effectual working;" others, again, "That they (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the treasures of wisdom) are double (or manifold) in substance." Perhaps this last rendering is to be preferred. The treasures of wisdom that are hid away in God have many depths, secret and unexplored; they "lie, as it were, fold over fold, in unexpected complexities, defying the shallow and unscrutinizing gaze" (Professor Stanley Leathes). If they were revealed to Job, they would astonish, confound, silence, him. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. "Be sure," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "that God, so far from inflicting on thee a more severe punishment than thou deservest, in reality excuses much of thy guilt, and punishes thee less than is thy due." This is Zophar's conclusion from his general knowledge of God's dealings with man (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>).

No. In one sense, all men do well to profess them. selves "Agnostics" - not that they can know nothing of God, but that they can never know him fully, never exhaust the knowledge of him. As the apostle says, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God l how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33, 34</a><span class="cmt_word">).

"The earth" and "the sea" represent to him the illimitable.

And shut up; or, <span class="accented">imprison</span>. Or gather together; rather, <span class="accented">and call to judgment</span> (see the Revised Version). If God, that is, advance against a man in hostile fashion, seize and imprison him, and then call him to judgment, what is to be said or done? who can interfere with him? Matters must take their course. There is no ground for complaint It is simply God's mode of administering justice on the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Who can hinder him?</span> literally, <span class="accented">who can turn him sway? i.e.</span> interfere with his action, interrupt it, divert it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider <i>it</i>?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he knoweth vain men</span>. God is justified in these his judgments, even though he does not implead the man or bring him to account, or hear what he has got to say (Job 9:39), since he intuitively and at once "knoweth vain men;" sooth, that is, into the ground of the heart, and recognizes vanity, pretence, false seeming, so that he can judge infallibly without the forensic apparatus wherewith human tribunals are rightly surrounded, on account of the weakness and fallibility of human judges. He sooth wickedness also. If God can detect in a moment vanity,  pretence, false seeming, much more can he detect actual wickedness; which Zophar assumes to have been detected in Job's case<span class="cmt_word">. Will he not then consider it?</span> rather, <span class="accented">even though he consider it not</span> (see the Revised Version). God does not need to pause and ponder and "consider" each case. He knows, without any such lengthened consideration, whether a man is true to him or not.

Zophar seems to mean that, through Divine discipline, such as that described in ver. 10, a vain, foolish, puffed-up man may be reclaimed and become a man of understanding - a stubborn and untamed one, wild as the colt of a wild ass, grow into a real man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> acquire sense and discretion. If this is the meaning, undoubtedly Job is glanced at (so Schultens, Dillmann, and Canon Cook). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13</a></div><div class="verse">If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou prepare thine heart</span>. Having indicated God's righteousness by these general remarks (vers. 7-12), and implied that Job's complaints are vain and futile, Zophar, in conclusion, addresses Job once more directly: "If thou (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) prepare thine heart," cleanse it, that is, of all defilement, direct it, and set it straight (see <a href="../../par/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>) before God, then such and such results (set forth in vers. 15-19) will follow. And stretch out thine hands toward him. The outward act of worship must follow the inward movement of the heart, for the turning to God to be complete. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14</a></div><div class="verse">If iniquity <i>be</i> in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If iniquity be in thine hand</span>. Zophar assumes this to be probable, nay, almost certain. He has already told Job that God has exacted from him less than his iniquity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, the same word) deserves (ver. 6). Conformably with this view, he now suggests that it would not do for Job to stretch out to God in prayer a hand full of iniquity, and that therefore, previously to making his supplication, he would do well to lay his iniquity aside. In a general way, the advice is excellent; but it was insulting to Job, who denied that he had any definite act of sin on his conscience. <span class="cmt_word">Put it far away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> repent of it, confess it to God; if the case admits of it, make reparation or restitution. <span class="cmt_word">And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles</span>; or, in thy tents. The insinuation seems to be that Job is a robber chief, and that his tent and the tents of his followers are full of ill-gotten spoils, the fruit of his raids upon the defenceless.

The Hebrew cannot possibly bear this meaning. The uncommon word used is allied with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "obscurity," and, if a verb, should mean "thou shalt be obscure," rather than "thou shalt shine forth." But it is perhaps a substantive, meaning "darkness;" and the translation of the Revised Version is perhaps correct: "Though there be darkness." Thou shalt be as the morning. "Thy light," as Professor Lee explains, "shall gradually rise and expand itself far and wide." It shall dispel the darkness, and take its place," shining more and more unto the perfect day" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>).

Job, entering on this second period of prosperity, would be and feel secure; safe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from any return of calamity, because hope would once more animate him and be his predominant feeling. No doubt "hope springs eternal in the human breast;" and when Job's prosperity was actually restored (<a href="../../par/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12-16</a>), these anticipations had their fulfilment; but, as uttered by Zophar, there is a ring of insincerity about them, and we cannot but feel that his object in expatiating at length on the details of Job's coming happiness is not to console and encourage his friend, but rather to annoy and exasperate him, since the entire basis on which he builds is the assumption of Job's heinous guilt (vers. 3, 6, 11, 14), and the prosperity which he promises is to follow upon an acknowledgment of guilt and a putting sway of iniquity (vers. 13, 14), which he  knew that Job wholly repudiated<span class="cmt_word">. Yea, thou shalt dig about thee</span>. So Schultens, who understands it to mean that Job shall dig a moat around his habitation, to make himself perfectly secure. The verb has, however, two other meanings - "to investigate" or "search out," and "to blush;" and it is taken here in each of these meanings by some critics. Our Revisers translate, "Yea, thou shalt search about thee;" and so Canon Cook and Professor Stanley Loathes. Rosenmuller, on the other hand, and Professor Lee render the words by "Though thou shouldst blush," or "be ashamed." It is difficult to decide between such high authorities; but the fast that Job uses the verb in the sense of "search," "look after," in <a href="../../par/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>, and does not elsewhere use it in either of the other senses, should incline us to accept the rendering of the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt take thy rest in safety</span>; or, <span class="accented">securely</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a sense of being in perfect security.

Such, says Zophar, is always the final condition of the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
