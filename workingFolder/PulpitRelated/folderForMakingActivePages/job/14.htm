It would seem that the patriarch, having vented his feelings, experiences a certain relief, an interval of calm, in which, his own woes pressing less heavily upon him, he is content to moralize on the general condition of humanity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Man that is born of a woman</span>. In this fact Job sees the origin of man's inherent  weakness. He is "born of a woman," who is "the weaker vessel" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). He is conceived by her in uncleanness (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>; comp. below, ver. 4), brought forth in sorrow and pain (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>) suckled at her breasts, placed for years under her guidance. No wonder that he shares the weakness of which she is a sort of type. <span class="cmt_word">Is of few days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">short of days.</span> Length and shortness of days are, no doubt, relative; and it is difficult to say what term of life would not have seemed short to men as they looked back upon it. To Jacob, at the age of a hundred and thirty, it appeared that "<span class="accented">few</span> and evil had the days of the years of his life been" (<a href="../../par/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>). Methuselah, perhaps, thought the same. We all, as we come towards old age, and death draws manifestly near, feel as if we had only just begun to live, as if, at any rate, we had not done half our work, and were about to be cut off before our time. But would the case be seriously different if our tale of years were doubled? And fall of trouble (comp. <a href="../../par/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a></div><div class="verse">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down</span>. Few similes are more frequently used in Scripture (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-24.htm">1 Peter 1:24</a>), and certainly none could have more poetic beauty. Eastern flowers do not often last much more than a day. <span class="cmt_word">He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/7-2.htm">Job 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/8-9.htm">Job 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/109-23.htm">Psalm 109:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, etc.). Shadows are always changing; but the shadows which flee away the fastest, and which Job has probably in his mind, are those of clouds, or other moving objects, which seem to chase each other over the earth, and never to continue for a single minute in one stay. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a></div><div class="verse">And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one?</span> Is it compatible with God's greatness, unchangeableness, and majesty to take any notice of so poor, weak, and unstable a creature as mortal man? The question has been often asked, and answered by many in the negative, as by the Epicureans of old. Job does not really entertain any doubt upon the point; but only intends to express his wonder that it should be so (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, and above, <a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bringest me into judgment with thee?</span> Especially astonishing is it, Job says, that God should condescend to try, pass judgment on, and punish so weak, worthless, and transitory a creature as himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a></div><div class="verse">Who can bring a clean <i>thing</i> out of an unclean? not one.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</span> not one. It is scarcely true to say that "the fact of original sin is thus distinctly recognized" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 61). Original uncleanness and infirmity are recognized; but the uncleanness is material, and removable by material expiation (<a href="../../par/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2-8</a>). It is rather man's weakness than his sinfulness that is here under discussion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing his days <i>are</i> determined, the number of his months <i>are</i> with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing his days are determined</span>. Job here returns to the consideration of the shortness of man's life. "His days are determined;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are a limited period, known to and fixed beforehand by God. They are not like God's days, which "endure throughout all generations" (<a href="../../par/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The number of his months are with thee</span>. "With thee" means here "known to thee," "laid up in thy counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass</span>. "His bounds" are "the limit of his lifetime." The <span class="accented">three</span> clauses are pleonastic. One idea pervades them all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-6.htm">Job 14:6</a></div><div class="verse">Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn from him, that he may rest</span>; literally, <span class="accented">look away from him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Cease to watch him and search him out so continually" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17, 18</a>). "Then he will be able to have a breathing-time, an interval of peace and rest, before his departure from the earth." What Job had previously desired for himself (<a href="../../par/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>) he now asks for all humanity. <span class="cmt_word">Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day</span>. Hired labourers are glad when their day's work is over. So man rejoices when life comes to an end. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down</span>. God's vegetable creation is better off, in respect of length of days, than man. Let a tree be cut down, it is not therefore of necessity destroyed. There is yet hope for it. The bare dry stump will sometimes put forth tender branches, which will grow and flourish, and renew the old life. Or, if the stump be quite dead, suckers may spring up from the root and grow into new trees as vigorous as the one that they replace (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). Herodotus considered that all trees had this recuperative power, except the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, a species of fir (Herod., 6:37), and the traveller Shaw says that when a palm tree dies there is always a sucker ready to take its place. Pliny also observes of the laurel, "Viva-cissima est radix, ita ut, si truncus ina-ruerit, recisa arbor mox laetius frutificet" ('Hist. Nat.,' 1:15. &sect; 30). <span class="cmt_word">That it will sprout again</span>. That is, from the spool or stump. Some trees, as the Spanish chest. nut, if cut down flush with the ground, throw up shoots from the entire circle of the stomp, often as many as fifteen or twenty. <span class="cmt_word">And that the tender branch thereof will not cease</span>. The vigour of such shoots is very great. In a few years they grow to the height of the parent tree. If they are then removed they are quickly replaced by a fresh growth.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</div><div class="comm">

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where <i>is</i> he?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But man dieth</span>. "Man" is here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, "the brave, strong man," not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and the meaning is that man, however brave and' strong, perishes. <span class="cmt_word">And wasteth away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "comes to nought, remains no strength or vitality." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</span> "Where is he?" Job could not answer this question. He might say, "In Sheol." But where was Sheol, and what was Sheol? There was no written revelation on this subject, and no traditional knowledge on which dependence could be placed. The Hebrew notions on the subject were very vague and indeterminate; Job's notions are likely to have been still vaguer. There is no reason to believe that he had any exact acquaintance with the tenets of the Egyptians. He may have known the Chaldean teaching, but it would not have carried him very far(see above, pp. 178, 179). Doubt and perplexity beset him whenever he turned his attention to the problem of man's condition after death, and, excepting when carried away by a burst of enthusiasm, he seems to have regarded it as the highest wisdom, in matters of this kind, "to knew that he knew nothing." The question, "Where is he?" is an acknowledgment of this profound ignorance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the waters fail from the sea</span>. The allusion seems to be to the actual desiccation of seas and rivers. Job, apparently, had known instances of both. A formation of new land in the place, of sea is always going on at the head of the Persian Gulf, through the deposits of the Tigris and Euphrates; and this formation was very rapid in ancient times, when the head of the gulf was narrower. The desiccation of river-courses is common in Mesopotamia, where arms thrown out by the Tigris and Euphrates get blocked, and then silted up. <span class="cmt_word">And the flood decayeth and drieth up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the</span> <span class="accented">river decayeth</span> etc. (see the comment on the preceding clause). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens <i>be</i> no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So man lieth down, and riseth not</span>. This is not an absolute denial of a <span class="accented">final</span> resurrection, since Job is speaking of the world as it lies before him, not of eventualities. Just as he sees the land encroach upon the sea, and remain land, and the river-courses, once dried up, remain dry, so he sees men descend into the grave and remain there, without rising up again. This is the established order of nature as it exists before his eyes. <span class="cmt_word">Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake</span>. This order of things, Job believes, rightly enough, will continue as long as the heavens and the earth endure. What will happen afterwards he does not so much as inquire. It is remarked, ingeniously, that Job's words, though not intended in this sense, exactly "coincide with the declarations of the New Testament, which make the resurrection simultaneous with the breaking up of the visible universe" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Nor be raised out of their sleep</span>. If "the glimmer of a hope" of the resurrection appears anywhere in vers. 10-12, it is in the comparison of death to a sleep, which is inseparably connected in our minds with an awakening. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-13.htm">Job 14:13</a></div><div class="verse">O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave!</span> literally, in <span class="accented">Sheol</span> which here does not so much mean "the grave," as the place of departed spirits, described in <a href="../../par/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>. Job desires to have God's protection in that" land of darkness," and to be "hidden" there by him until his wrath be past. It has been generally supposed that he means after his death; but Schultens thinks his desire was to descend to Sheol <span class="accented">alive</span> and there remain, while his punishment continued, hidden from the eyes of men. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past.</span> Job assumes that, if he is being punished for his youthful sins (<a href="../../par/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>), his punishment will not be for long - at any rate, not for ever; God's anger will at last be satisfied and cease. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span> How long he may have to suffer be does not greatly care. Only let it be "a set time" - a fixed, definite period  - and at the end of it, let God" remember" him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a></div><div class="verse">If a man die, shall he live <i>again</i>? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man die, shall he live again?</span> The question is clearly intended to be answered in the negative. It is not a dispassionate inquiry, but an expression of hopelessness. Let a man once die, and of course he cannot live again. Were it otherwise, then, Job says, <span class="cmt_word">all the days of my appointed time will I wait;</span> or, rather (as in the Revised Version), <span class="accented">all the days of my warfare would</span> I <span class="accented">wait</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I would patiently endure any sufferings in the larger hope that would then be open to me. <span class="cmt_word">I would wait till my change</span> (rather, <span class="accented">my renewal</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>come</span>. The exact nature of the 'renewal" which Job seems here to expect is obscure. Perhaps he is pursuing the idea, broached in ver. 13, of his being conveyed <span class="accented">alive</span> to Hades, and looks forward to a furthur renewed life after he is released from that "land of darkness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-15.htm">Job 14:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou shouldest call</span>, <span class="accented">and</span>  I <span class="accented">would answer thee</span> (see the Revised Version). In that case, when I quitted Hades, and renewed my life, thou wouldst assuredly summon me to thee, and I would respond to the summons. There would be sweet colloquy between us; for thou wilt (or, rather, <span class="accented">wouldest</span>) have a desire to the work of thine hands (comp. ch. 10:8-11). Job assumes that God must love whatever he has created, and be drawn towards it by a secret, strong desire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-16.htm">Job 14:16</a></div><div class="verse">For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For now thou numberest my steps</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but now</span>. Job, at this point, proceeds to contrast his actual condition with the ideal one which (in vers. 13-15) his imagination has conjured up. God's actual attitude towards him he regards as one, not of protecting love, but of jealous hostility. His "steps" are observed, counted - every divergence from the right path is noted - a false step, if he makes one, is at once punished. <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou not watch over my sin?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a>). Job's sins, he thinks, are watched for, spied out, taken note of, and remembered against him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a></div><div class="verse">My transgression <i>is</i> sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My transgression is sealed up in a bag</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-34.htm">Deuteronomy 32:34</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God keeps account of all my transgressions. It is as if he put them all into a bag (compare "Put my tears into thy bottle," <a href="../../par/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>), whence they can be taken out and brought against me at any moment. They are "sealed up" in the bag for greater security. <span class="cmt_word">And thou sewest up mine iniquity.</span> (So Ewald, Dillmaun, Canon Cook, and the Revised Version.) Others think the meaning to be, "Thou addest to my iniquity [continually];" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by placing fresh sins to my account. (So Schultens and Rosenmuller.)

Job here resumes the lament 'over human infirmity, with which the chapter opens (vers. 1-12); but he has, perhaps, in this passage, his own case mote distinctly presented to his consciousness. With the wealth of metaphor which characterizes his utterances, he compares the ruin of a prosperous man <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the sudden collapse of a mountain; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the removal of a rock out of its place; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to the wearing away of stones by the constant flow of streams; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> to the destruction of alluvial tracts by floods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mountains collapse, either by volcanic agency, which is quite as much shown in the subsidence as in the elevation of the soil, or by landslips, which are most usually the results of heavy rains. <span class="cmt_word">And the rock is removed out of his place</span>. Rocks are sometimes split by frost, and topple over when a thaw comes; at other times, heavy floods remove them from their accustomed place; occasionally earthquakes overturn them, and cause them to fall with a crash. There is also a removal of rocks to much greeter distances, by means of glaciers and icebergs; but of these Job is not likely to have known. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a></div><div class="verse">The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow <i>out</i> of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The waters wear the stones</span>. The power of the soft element of water, by continual washing or dripping, to wear away the hardest stone, has often been noticed, and is a frequent topic in poetry. Deep ravines have been worn in course of time, through broad and lofty mountain ranges by rivers, the stone yielding little by little to the action of the water, until at last a broad chasm is made. So the continual wearing action of calamity often lays low the prosperous. <span class="cmt_word">Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "overflows of water, inundations, floods, not only make a way through rocks, but often carry off great tracts of rich soil, hurrying the alluvium down to the sea, and leaving in its place a marsh or a waste." <span class="cmt_word">And thou destroyest the hope of man</span>.

Nic.,' 1:11). <span class="cmt_word">And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them</span>. Equally, in the opposite case, <span class="accented">if</span> his sons are brought low, he is ignorant of it, and unaffected by their fate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-22.htm">Job 14:22</a></div><div class="verse">But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But his flesh upon him shall have pain</span>. The best rendering is probably that which is placed in the margin of the  Revised Version, <span class="accented">only for himself his flesh hath pain</span>, <span class="accented">and for himself his soul mourneth.</span> Nothing more is intended than to negative the idea that the future condition of his children will seriously affect a man who is suffering under God's afflicting hand, either in this life or afterwards. He cannot but be occupied solely with himself. His own sufferings, whether of body or mind, win absorb all his attention. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
