He has evidently been exceedingly nettled by Job's contemptuous words concerning his "comforters" (<a href="../../par/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>); and aims at nothing but venting his anger, and terrifying Job by a series of denunciations and threats. Job has become to him "the wicked man" (vers. 5, 21), an embodiment of all that is evil, and one "that knoweth not God." No punishment is too severe for him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, How long will it be ere ye make an end of words?</span> (So Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Welte, Merx, Lee, and Canon Cook.) Others render, "How long will ye <span class="accented">lay snares for</span> words?" which is a possible translation, but does not give a very good sense. Bildad, a tolerably concise speaker himself (see <a href="../../par/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2-22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2-6</a>), is impatient at the length of Job's replies. He had already, in his former speech (<a href="../../par/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>), reproached Job with his prolixity; now he repeats the charge. The employment of the second person <span class="accented">plural</span> in this and the following verses is not very easily accounted for. Bildad can scarcely mean to blame his friend Eliphaz. Perhaps he regards Job as having supporters among the lookers-on, of whom there may have been several besides Elihu (<a href="../../par/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>). Mark; rather, <span class="accented">consider</span>;  <span class="accented">i.e.</span> think a little, instead of talking. <span class="cmt_word">And afterwards we will speak</span>. Then, calmly and without hurry, we will proceed to reply to what you have said.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-3.htm">Job 18:3</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore are we counted as beasts, <i>and</i> reputed vile in your sight?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore are we counted as beasts?</span> The allusion is probably to <a href="../../par/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>, where Job spoke of his "comforters" as "gaping upon him with their mouths." <span class="cmt_word">And reputed vile in your sight!</span> or, <span class="accented">reckoned unclean</span>. Job had spoken of his "miserable comforters" as "ungodly and wicked" (<a href="../../par/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a>), without wisdom (<a href="../../par/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>) and without understanding (<a href="../../par/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>). But he had not said that they were "unclean." Bildad, therefore, misrepresents him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He teareth himself in his anger</span>. The Hebrew idiom, which allows of rapid transitions from the second to the third person, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, cannot be transferred without harshness to our modern speech. Our Revisers have given the true force of the original by discarding the third person, and translating, "Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger." There is probably an allusion to <a href="../../par/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>, where Job had represented God as "tearing him in his wrath." Bildad says it is not God who tests him - he tears himself. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Shall the course of the world be altered to meet thy wishes, to suit thy case?" Job had wished for all manner of impossible things (<a href="../../par/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>). Bildad's reproach is thus not wholly unjust. But he makes no allowance for the wild utter-shoes of one who is half distraught. <span class="cmt_word">And shall the rock be removed out of his place?</span> Shall that which is most solid and firm give way, and alter its nature? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-21.</span> - Bildad, from this point, turns wholly to denunciation. He strings together a long series of menaces - probably ancient saws, drawn from "the wisdom of the Beni Kedem" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>), and descriptive of the wretched fate of the wicked man, with whom he identifies Job. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out</span>. Whatever the wicked man may at any time have acquired of splendour, glory, honour, wealth, or prosperity, shall be taken from him, and as it were extinguished. <span class="cmt_word">And the spark of his fire shall not shine</span>. Not a single trace of his splendour, not a spark, not a glimmer, shall remain. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-6.htm">Job 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light shall be dark in his tabernacle</span>. This is not, as Rosenmuller asserts, a mere repetition of the thought contained in the preceding verse with a change of terms, and a variation of metaphor. It is a denunciation of woe to the whole <span class="accented">house</span> of the ungodly man, not to himself only. As Schultens says, "Lumen ob-tenebratum <span class="accented">in tentorio</span> est fortuna <span class="accented">domus</span> extincta." <span class="cmt_word">And his candle shall be put out with him</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">his!amp above him shall be put out</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the lamp which swings above him in his tent, or in his chamber, shall be extinguished. Darkness shall fall upon the whole house of the wicked man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The steps of his strength shall he straitened</span>. In the time of his prosperity the wicked man had a wide sphere within which to exercise his activity, and strode hither and thither at his pleasure. When punishment falls on him, his "steps will be straitened," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his sphere narrowed, his activity cramped, his powers "cabined, cribbed, confined." <span class="cmt_word">And his own counsel shall cast him down</span> (see <a href="../../par/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a>,-16; 9:16; 10:2; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>).

A mere repetition of the idea expressed in the preceding hemistich. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-9.htm">Job 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">The gin shall take <i>him</i> by the heel, <i>and</i> the robber shall prevail against him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber</span> (rather, <span class="accented">the man-trap</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall prevail against him</span>. Fifty years ago man-traps were commonly set at night in gardens and orchards in this country, which held intending thieves until the proprietor came and took them before a magistrate in the morning. (On the employment of such traps in antiquity, see Herod., 2:121. &sect; 2.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-10.htm">Job 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">The snare <i>is</i> laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way;</span> or, <span class="accented">the noose is hid for him in the ground</span> (see the Revised Version). Six different kinds of traps or snares are mentioned, "the speaker heaping together every word that he can find descriptive of the art of snaring." The art had been well studied by the Egyptians long before the age of Job, and a great variety of contrivances for capturing both beasts and birds are represented on the very early monuments (Wilkinson, in the authors' Herodotus,' vol. it. pp. 77, 78). We may conclude from this passage that it had also been brought to an advanced stage of excellence in Syria and Arabia. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a></div><div class="verse">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side</span>. Vague fears, panic terrors, no longer subjective, but to his bewildered brain objective, shall seem to menace the wicked man on every side, and shall affright him continually. There is an allusion, doubtless, to what Job has said of the  gloomy and terrifying thoughts which come over him from time to time (<a href="../../par/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-28.htm">Job 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>) and fill him with consternation. <span class="cmt_word">And shall drive him to his feet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall chase him at his</span> heels (see the Revised Version). Like a pack of hounds, or wolves, or jackals. Jackals are common in Palestine and the adjacent countries. They hunt in lacks, and generally run down their prey; but do not, unless hard pressed by hunger, attack men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a></div><div class="verse">His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction <i>shall be</i> ready at his side.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His strength shall be hunger-bitten</span>. (So Dillmann, Cook, and the Revised Version.) To the other sufferings of the wicked man shall be added the pangs of hunger. His bodily strength shall disappear, as destitution and famine come upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And destruction shall be ready at his side</span>. Ready to seize on him at any moment. Some translate, "ready for his halting" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ready to seize on him in ease of his tripping or halting (so the Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a></div><div class="verse">It shall devour the strength of his skin: <i>even</i> the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall devour the strength of his skin</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the bars of his skin</span> by which some understand "the muscles," some "the members," of his body. The general meaning is plain, that destruction shall always be close to him, and shall ultimately make him its own. <span class="cmt_word">Even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength</span>. By "the firstborn of death" is probably intended, either some wasting disease generally, or perhaps the special disease from which Job is suffering. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-14.htm">Job 18:14</a></div><div class="verse">His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he shall be rooted out of his tabernacle</span> (or, tent), <span class="accented">which</span> is <span class="accented">his confidence</span>, or <span class="accented">wherein he trusteth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be torn from the home, where he thought himself secure as in a stronghold. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall bring him</span>; rather, one <span class="accented">shall bring him</span> or, he <span class="accented">shall be brought. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To the king of terrors</span>. Probably death, rather than Satan, is intended. None of Job's "comforters" seems to have had any conception of Satan as a personal being, nor even Job himself. It is only the author. or arranger, of the book who recognizes the personality and power of the prince of darkness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a></div><div class="verse">It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because <i>it is</i> none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his</span>; either, <span class="accented">it</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> terror) <span class="accented">shall dwell in his tabernacle</span> <span class="accented">which is no longer his</span>; or, <span class="accented">they shall dwell in his tabernacle that are none of his</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> strangers st, all inhabit the place where he dwelt heretofore (compare the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation</span>. As God rained fire and brimstone out of heaven upon the cities of the plain (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>), so shall brimstone be scattered upon his habitation to ruin and destroy it (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>).

This is always spoken of in Scripture as a great calamity, one of the greatest that can befall a man. It was felt as such, not only by the Jews, but by the Semitic people generally, whose earnest desire to perpetuate their memory is shown by the elaborate monuments and lengthy inscriptions which they set up in so many places. Arabian poetry, no less than Jewish, is penetrated by the idea. In one point of view it may seem a vulgar ambition; but, in another, it is a pathetic craving alter that continuance which the spirit of man naturally desires, but of which it has, apart from revelation, no assurance. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall have no name in the street</span>; or, <span class="accented">in the world without</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>).

What Job represents as a welcome retreat, whither he would gladly withdraw himself, Bildad depicts as a banishment, into which he will be driven on account of his sins.

It is implied that the wicked man shall be a vagabond, without a home, sojourning now here, now there, for a short time. Neither among his own people, nor in these places of his temporary abode, shall he leave any descendant. Bildad probably intends to glance at the destruction of Job's children (<a href="../../par/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>).
