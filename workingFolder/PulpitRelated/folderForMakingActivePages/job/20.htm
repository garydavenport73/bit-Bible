He adds coarseness and rudeness to his former vehement hostility (vers. 7, 15). His whole discourse is a covert denunciation of Job as a wicked man and a hypocrite (vers. 5, 12, 19, 29), deservedly punished by God for a life of crime. He ends by prophesying Job's violent death, the destruction of his house, and the rising up of heaven and earth in witness against him (vers. 24-28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, <span class="cmt_word">Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer</span>. Zophar "has heard the check of his reproach" (ver. 3), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the reproach contained in the last words of Job in the preceding chapter. <span class="accented">Therefore</span> his thoughts rise up within him, and com-psi him to make a reply. He cannot allow Job to shift the onus of guilt and the menace of punishment on his friends, when it is he, Job, that is the guilty person, over whom the judgments of God impend. <span class="cmt_word">And for this I make haste</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and because of my haste that is within me</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "because I am of a hasty and impetuous temperament."

Some suppose an allusion to <a href="../../par/job/19-2.htm">Job 19:2, 3</a>; but it is better to regard Zophar as enraged by vers. 28, 29 of <a href="../../par/job/19.htm">Job 19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer</span>. This claim is not quite consistent with the acknowledgment of hastiness in ver. 2.

The passage is among those which make for the high antiquity of the book. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">That the triumphing of the wicked <i>is</i> short, and the joy of the hypocrite <i>but</i> for a moment?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the triumphing of the wicked is short</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17-19</a>, etc.). This is one of the main points of dispute between Job and his opponents. It has been previously maintained by Eliphaz (<a href="../../par/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8-11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-3.htm">Job 5:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21, 29</a>) and by Bildad (<a href="../../par/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11-19</a>), as it is now by Zophar, and may be regarded as the traditional belief of the time, which scarcely any ventured to question. His own observation, however, has convinced Job that the fact is otherwise. He has seen the wicked "live, become old, and remain mighty in power" (<a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>); he has seen them "spend their days in wealth," and die quietly, as "in a moment" (<a href="../../par/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>). In <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a> he seems to argue that this is the general, if not universal, lot of such persons. Later on, however, in <a href="../../par/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13-23</a>, he retracts this view, or, at any rate, greatly modifies it, admitting that usually retribution does even in this life overtake the wicked. And this seems to be the general sentiment of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Raro antecedentem scelestum,<br />Deseruit pede poena claudlo."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Horace, 'Od.,' 3:2, ll. 31, 32.</span>) There remains, however, the question whether the triumphing of the wicked can fairly be considered "short," and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. When we consider the lives of Dionysius the elder, Sylla, Marius, Tiberius, Louis XIV., Napoleon, it is difficult to answer this question in the affirmative.

In the former passage it is used of a falcon, in the latter of the sun.

But the translation of the Authorized Version seems preferable. His children will curry favour with the poor, either by making restitution to them on account of their father's injuries, or simply because they are friendless, and desire to ingratiate themselves with some one. <span class="cmt_word">And his hands shall restore their goods</span> (comp. vers. 15 and 18). He himself will be so crushed and broken in spirit that he will give back with his own hands the goods whereof he has deprived the poor.

A little while, and these vigorous bones, this entire body, so full of life and youth, shall be lying with the man himself, with all that constitutes his personality, in the dust of death (comp. vers. 24, 25).

It is, perhaps, the most surprising among the phenomena of wickedness that men can gloat over it, voluntarily recur to it, make a boast of it, recount signal instances of it to their friends, and seem to find a satisfaction in the recollection. One would have expected that shame and self-disapproval and fear of retribution would have led them to dismiss their wicked acts from their thoughts as soon as possible. But certainly the fact is otherwise.

Still, a time comes when the self-complacency of the wicked man is shaken. He experiences a failure of health or spirits. Then, suddenly, it is as if the meat that he has swallowed had been turned to poison in his bowels, as if the gall of asps were within him. Compare what Bishop Butler says of the sudden waking up of a man's conscience ('Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 2. p. 52). The ancients seem to have known that the poison of serpents was a strong acid, and therefore supposed that it was secreted by the gallbladder (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 11:37).

The wicked man shall be made to disgorge his ill-gotten gains. Either fear, or remorse, or a judicial sentence will force him to make restitution (see ver. 10). God shall cast them out of his belly. Whatever is the immediate motive of the restitution: it will really be God's doing. He will cause the fear, or the remorse, or bring about the judicial sentence.

Probably Zophar does not affix any very distinct meaning to his threats. He is content to utter a series of fierce-sounding but vague menaces, which he knows that Job will regard as launched against himself, and does not care whether they are taken metaphorically or literally. Job will be equally distressed in either ease. <span class="cmt_word">The viper's tongue shall slay him</span>. It is really the viper's <span class="accented">tooth</span>, and not his <span class="accented">tongue</span>, that slays; but Zophar is not, any more than Job (<a href="../../par/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>), an accomplished naturalist.

So Schultens, Professor Lee, and Dr. Stanley Leathes, who understand Zophar as asserting that, in order to compensate those whom he has robbed, the wicked man will have to make over to them all the wealth that is honestly his Others translate, "According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice" (see the Revised Version, and the commentaries of Ewald, Delitzsch, and Dillmann).

This is no indication of the late authorship of Job. Iron was in use in Egypt at a very early date. A thin plate of it was found by Colonel Howard Vyse embedded in the masonry of the great pyramid; and iron implements and ornaments, iron spear-heads, iron sickles, iron gimlets, iron keys, iron bracelets, iron wire, have been found in the early tombs not infrequently (see the author's 'History of Ancient  Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 505). That they are not more common is accounted for by the rapid oxidization of iron by exposure to the air, and its rapid decay in the nitrous soil of Egypt. The inhabitants of South-Western Asia were at no time much behind the Egyptians in their knowledge of the useful arts: and iron appears as a well-known metal in the Jewish Scriptures from the time of the Exodus (see <a href="../../par/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/8-31.htm">Joshua 8:31</a>). It is true that the principal weapons of war continued to be made ordinarily of bronze, both in South-Western Asia and in Egypt, till a comparatively late period; but Zophar may mean to assign to the slayer of the wicked man weapons of a superior character. <span class="cmt_word">And the bow of steel shall strike him through</span>. It is uncertain whether steel was known in the ancient world. But, whether or no, "steel" is not meant here. The word used in the original is <span class="accented">nehushtah</span>, which undoubtedly means either "copper" or "bronze." As copper would be too soft a material for a bow, we may assume bronze to be intended. The bronze used in Egypt was extremely elastic, and there would have been little difficulty in fashioning bows of it (on the existence of such bows, see 2 Samuel 26:5; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>).

The stricken man draws the arrow from his flesh, the natural action of every one so wounded. If the arrow was simply tipped with a smooth iron point, it would be easy to withdraw it; but a barbed arrow could only be cut out. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the glittering point.</span> The arrow is supposed to have pierced the gall-bladder, and to be drawn forth from it. There would be little chance of recovery in such a case. Hence terrors are upon him.

This is Zophar's reply to the appeal which Job made (in <a href="../../par/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18, 19</a>) to heaven and earth to bear their witness in his favour. Heaven, he says, instead of testifying to his innocence, will one day, when the books are opened (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>), "reveal his iniquity;" and earth, instead of echoing his cry, will "rise up" in indignation "against him." He will have none either in heaven or earth to take his part, or give any testimony in his favour.

"The increase of his house" may be either his children and descendants; or his substance - that which he has accumulated. In the former case, the departure spoken of may be either death (see ver. 26), or carrying into captivity; in the latter, general rapine and destruction. <span class="cmt_word">And his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath</span>. It seems to be necessary to supply some such nominative as "his goods," or "his treasure," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (see ver. 26).
