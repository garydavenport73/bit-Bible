"Treacherous Israelites are to be dreaded more than malicious Canaanites" (Matthew Henry). <span class="cmt_word">Take all the people of wax with thee.</span> Not, as has been before stated, because 3,000 men were too few to take the city, for the capture of Jericho was a far greater marvel than that of Ai with this number of men. The true reason is indicated by Calvin, and is indeed suggested by the words "Fear not, neither be thou dismayed." It was to reassure the people, whose hearts had "melted and become as water." Sometimes God calls upon His people for a display of faith, as when He led them through the Jordan, or commanded them to compass Jericho seven days. But in days of despondency He compassionates their weakness and permits them to rely upon visible means of support (see also below, ver. 3). Matthew Henry thinks that a tacit rebuke is here administered to Joshua for sending so few men to Ai on the frowner occasion. He ought to have permitted all to have shared the toil and glory. <span class="cmt_word">I have given into thy hand.</span> The work, let man do his best, is God's after all. <span class="cmt_word">The king.</span> For the political condition of Palestine before the Israelitish invasion see Introduction. <span class="cmt_word">And his land.</span> As in the case of the early Germanic peoples, there was a certain portion of their land in the neigbourhood attached to each city which was used for agricultural purposes (see Introduction; also <a href="../../par/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only the spoil thereof.</span> Ai was not solemnly devoted, like Jericho, though (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16, 17</a>) the Canaanitish people were. <span class="cmt_word">Behind it.</span> Joshua was advancing from the southeast. The ambush (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> literally, "a lier in wait," here a band of liers in wait, the word itself originally signifying <span class="accented">to plait, weave</span>, hence to <span class="accented">design</span>) was therefore (ver. 12) on the opposite, or west side of the city. The question which has been raised whether God could rightly command a stratagem seems scarcely to require discussion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty thousand.</span> In ver. 12 we read 5,000, and this must be the true reading. Thirty thousand men could hardly have been posted, without detection, in the ravines around Ai, whereas we are informed by travellers that there would have been no difficulty in concealing 5,000 men there. See, however, the passage cited from Lieut. Conder's Report in the note on Joshua 7:2. The confused condition of the numbers in the present text of the Old Testament is a well known fact, and it is proved by the great discrepancies in this respect between the Books of Chronicles and those of Samuel and Kings. Some have thought (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Haverniek, 'Introduction to the Old Testament,' II. 1:15) that <span class="accented">two</span> bands were laid in ambush, one on the northwest and the other on the southwest. This is a possible, though not probable, solution of the difficulty (see below). Then we must suppose that the city was nearly surrounded, Joshua and the main body on the southeast, the larger detachment on the north (ver. 13), and the smaller ambush on the west (see note on ver. 13). Keil, in his earlier editions, supposed that Joshua assaulted Ai with 30,000 men, out of whom he chose 5,000 as an ambush. So also Hengstenberg's 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 219. But this only introduces a third contradiction, for we are told both in vers. 1 and 3 that Joshua took with him "all the men of war." Keil has, however, abandoned that supposition, which is contrary to all the ancient versions, including the present text of the LXX. The Bishop of Lincoln suggests that 5,000 men may have been detached to reinforce the former detachment of 30,000. But to say nothing of the improbability of an ambush of 35,000 men remaining undetected (and they were specially instructed - see next verse - not to station themselves far from the city), we have the plain statement in ver. 12 <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> "he stationed (or <span class="accented">had stationed</span>) them as an ambush."

Many instances will occur to the student of history, and among others the celebrated feigned flight of William the Conqueror at Hastings. St. Augustine doubts whether this stratagem were lawful. Cajetan and the Jesuit commentators reply that it was so "quia mendacium non tam facile committitur factis, quam verbis" (Cornelius a Lapide).

Therefore the narrow waterless ravine in which the troops in ambush were to lie hid is not meant here, but a wider valley.

The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> though deep, as the name implies, was a valley large enough for cultivation or luxuriant vegetation (<a href="../../par/job/39-10.htm">Job 39:10</a>; Psalm 65:14; <a href="../../par/songs/2-1.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1</a>). Even a battle might be fought there (<a href="../../par/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21</a>).

See note on Joshua 7:2. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the difficulty involved in their retention may have caused their omission from the LXX., and it may perhaps be thought possible that, on the capture of Ai, the Bethelites returned with all speed to their city, and that Joshua postponed its capture in consequence of the formidable confederacy (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1, 2</a>), which his success had called into existence, or, perhaps, by a desire to signalise at once the victory at Ai by the ceremony (vers. 30-35) at Gerizim.

But the Ai mentioned in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a> may have been a city built, not on precisely the same spot, but near enough to it to take its name. And if Ai signifies ruins, and Dean Stanley be right in regarding it as referring to ruins in the days of the Philistines, the name would be particularly suitable to this particular city. Travellers have identified the place with Tel-el. Hajar, immediately to the south of the Wady Mutyah.

The LXX. does not introduce it here, but after <a href="../../par/joshua/9-2.htm">Joshua 9:2</a>. For other authorities see below. It is very easy to see why its genuineness has been disputed. The Book of Joshua has many marks of having been written not so very long after the events described in it. But it has been a favourite opinion with the school which disputes the authenticity of the books of the Bible, that Deuteronomy was a late revision by Ezra of the law of Moses, though this (see Introduction) has lately been discarded for another hypothesis. But we have, if the present passage be genuine, a distinct proof that the Book of Joshua was written after the Book of Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy is here quoted as the "book of the law of Moses" (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9, 24, 26</a>). The grounds on which the genuine. ness of the passage has been denied are these: First, the passage begins with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;</span> followed by an imperfect, or future, as does the interpolated passage in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-41.htm">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a>. This is Maurer's theory. But in this case we must reject every passage which begins thus, and certainly we should do so on grounds which, to say the least, are very slender. Next, we are told that Joshua could not have ventured to trust himself so far in the heart of a hostile country. But why not? Gerizim was not more than twenty miles from Ai. The Canaanites, we are told, were panic stricken at Joshua's success. The Gibeonites were not disposed to offer any hindrance to his progress; on the contrary, they hastened to form an alliance with him. And these solemn religious rites, performed by a people so clearly under the protection of the Most High, were more likely to increase than lessen the awe felt by the surrounding tribes. The only difficulty is that the women and children (v. 35) are expressly said to have gone thither also, and it seems improbable that they, whom we have supposed to have been left under a guard at Gilgal, should have been brought so far while the country was as yet unsubdued. And the difficulty is increased by finding Joshua again at Gilgal in <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>. But there is the hypothesis that this was another Gilgal to fall back upon, and this (see note on the passage just mentioned) is an extremely probable one. The suggestion of many commentators, that the passage has been transposed, is of course possible. We can only leave the difficulty unsolved, as one which a fuller knowledge of the facts, could we obtain it, would clear up at once. But we may be sure that if the passage were an interpolation, some explanation would have been given of the circumstances which seem to us so perplexing. And on the other hand we must remember that, as has been already contended, the notion that the whole camp of Israel performed this journey at a time when stupefaction had seized upon the Canaanitish tribes, though involving some amount of impossibility, is by no means impossible. (See also note on ver. 33). A number of extraordinary interpretations of this passage have been given. A favourite Rabbinical interpretation (see note on next verse) was that this altar was erected on the very day on which the Israelites crossed the Jordan. This was of course a physical impossibility. Josephus, on the contrary, supposes that five years elapsed before its erection, while Rabbi Israel, in the Jerusalem Talmud, thinks that it was deferred until after the expiration of fourteen years, and after the land had been divided. So Masius <span class="accented">in loc.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In Mount Ebal.</span> Between it and Gerizim stood the city of Shechem, or Sychar, as it is called in St. <a href="../../par/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. Gerizim was close to this city, as <a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 7</a> and St. <a href="../../par/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a> testify, as well as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. Dr. Maclear, in the 'Cambridge Bible for Schools,' suggests that the Israelites took this opportunity of interring the bones of Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25, 26</a>) in the piece of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>). (See <a href="../../par/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/8-31.htm">Joshua 8:31</a></div><div class="verse">As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up <i>any</i> iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded</span> (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4, 5</a>). Here, and in ver. 33, we find the writer making an extract from the Book of Deuteronomy. As has been before said, the natural explanation is that the Book of Joshua was written after the Book of Deuteronomy, and that the Book of Deuteronomy was written by Moses, or how could Joshua have carried out instructions which had never been given? The Elohist, Jehovist, and Denteronomist theory supposes the compiler of the Book of Joshua to have done his work in so perfunctory a fashion, that it is quite possible for critics living at a distance of three thousand years and more to detect the various fragments of which his mosaic is constructed. He is so void of common sense as to have inserted this narrative in a place so obviously unsuitable that it involves a palpable contradiction to probability and common sense, and this when he could have placed it in a dozen other parts of the book where no such improbability would be involved. Yet, in spite of the incredible carelessness with which he put his materials together, we are required to believe that "the Deuteronomist" had the foresight to insert the fulfilment of the command of Moses which he had invented in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-1.htm">Deuteronomy 27:1-26</a>; and that in so doing he abbreviated the narrative so as to leave out many details of his own invention. Now, under the supposition of a later fabrication of supplementary observances to be imposed upon the children of Israel, it is hardly probable that the account of the plaster with which the stones were to be plastered, and the enumeration of the tribes and the curses, would be omitted, since by the hypothesis the object of the Deuteronomist was to secure implicit obedience to the sacerdotal enactments he was inventing. But on the hypothesis of the genuineness of both writings everything fits in naturally enough. <span class="cmt_word">An altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron.</span> As though to intimate (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>) that all should be natural and spontaneous in the worship of God, and that as little of human devising should be introduced as possible. The altar must be raised by man, but the principles of the worship must not be devised by him. This interpretation, however, is rejected by Calvin, who thinks that all that was meant was to preclude the perpetual existence of the altar (though how the substitution of whole for hewn stones could effect this is not apparent); and Keil and Bahr ('Symbolik,' 1. pp. 487, 488),who think that the altar ought (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>) properly to be of earth, since sacrifice is rendered necessary by man's earthly or carnal nature, and that unhewn stone is the only substitute for earth which is allowed. But surely man's handiwork is the offspring of his unregenerate nature, and therefore may, from this point of view, be rightly employed in sacrifice. Hengstenberg ('Gesehichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 223) thinks that the reason of the command was that, since only one place of worship was permitted for all Israel, an altar had sometimes to be hastily thrown up. But when we consider the symbolic character of the Mosaic worship, we are compelled to reject this interpretation as unsatisfactory. Benjamin of Tudela (see Drusius <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) appears to have supposed that these stones were those which had been taken out of Jordan. Masius devotes considerable space to the refutation of this opinion (see also note on last verse). <span class="cmt_word">And they offered thereon.</span> Delitzsch remarks on the inversion of the order here, as compared with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>. But this is obviously the true order. The worship would naturally precede the ceremony rather than follow it.

"The wall destined to receive the picture," and it was just the same with inscriptions - was covered with a coating of lime and gypsum plaster. The outline was then sketched with red chalk, and afterwards corrected and filled in with black (Keurick's 'Egypt,' 1, p. 271). Thomson ('Land and the Book,' Io. 471) says that he has seen writings in plaster which could not have been less than two thousand years old. This passage shows that our author had <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2, 3</a> in his mind. The stones of the altar, which alone have been mentioned, are clearly not meant here, but the erection of plastered stone on which the law was to be written. <span class="cmt_word">A copy of the law of Moses,</span> "Deuteronomium legis," Vulgate. So also LXX. Not the whole law, nor yet the Book of Deuteronomy, for time would not permit,but the decalogue, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> duplicate, from whence the word Mishna comes, signifies. It is to be observed that the word is definite, the copy, not a copy, of the law. This (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>) was what was written on the two tables of stone, which (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>, 31:18) God gave to Moses. Yet it is possible that, as some commentaters suggest, and as ver. 34 may be held to imply, what is meant is the curses and blessings mentioned in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>, and 28. The formal setting up of this memorial was intended to remind the Israelites, by a perpetual standing witness, of the conditions on which they held the land of Canaan. And it is to be observed that the moral, rather than the positive, precepts of the law were thus solemnly enjoined on them, since neglect of the moral law of God is the invariable source of national degradation and decay. <span class="cmt_word">Which he wrote.</span> Namely, Joshua.

The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span> is used very loosely in Hebrew (see <a href="../../par/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>). We need not, therefore, assume as a matter of course that the whole people, men, women, and children, were taken up to Shechem to behold this ceremony. It is quite possible that during all Joshua's marches and campaigns a large number of the people remained under guard at Gilgal (see <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>), which remained the headquarters of the Israelites until the country was subdued. All that is here meant is that a very great number of the people were gathered together, and that every tribe, every age, and each sex were largely represented at this important ceremony. <span class="cmt_word">And officers.</span> Shoterim (see <a href="../../par/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Half of them.</span> Origen's explanation of the spiritual meaning of this passage is noteworthy, even though somewhat farfetched. He regards those of the tribes who stood on Mount Gerizim to bless, as the type of those who are led, not by fear of God's threatenings, but by a longing for God's promises and blessings; those who stood on Mount Ebal to curse, as the type of those who are driven by the fear of punishment to obey the will of God, and these finally attain salvation. The former, he adds, are the more noble of the two; but Jesus, who reads the hearts, gives each their proper station, and places some on Mount Ebal to curse, not that they themselves may receive the curse, but, by regarding the curse pronounced on sinners, may learn thereby how to escape it. <span class="cmt_word">Over against.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> rather, "in the direction off" The command in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> is that they shall stand upon the two mountains. No doubt certain representatives of the tribes stood on the mountain, and the rest of the people at the foot of the mountain, on either side of the valley, "crowding the slopes," as Canon Tristram says. The valley is narrow here, and the voice in mountainous regions, where the air is rarer, carries far. Under special circumstances, such as frosty weather, the voices of men crying their wares have been distinctly heard across the Humber in our own country. And in mountain passes, as any one who has travelled in them may easily ascertain, conversations may be carried on from opposite sides of a valley or ravine without the slightest difficulty. In this particular place Canon Tristram tell us ('Land of Israel,' pp. 149, 150) that when on Mount Gerizim he heard every word uttered by a man who was then driving his ass down Mount Ebal, and that afterwards two of his party recited the commandments antiphonally from the two sides of the valley without the least difficulty.
