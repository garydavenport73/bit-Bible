But this refers to a more advanced age still, when the patriarch felt his powers failing him, and desired, as far as his influence went, to preserve the Israelites in the path in which they had walked since their entrance into Canaan. Calvin has some good remarks on the "pious solicitude" shown by the aged warrior for those whom he had led in time of war and guided in time of peace. He seems to have sent for the chief men in Israel to his home at Timnath-Serah, where apparently he had led a retired and peaceful life, only coming forward to direct the affairs of the nation when necessity required. His address is simple and practical. He reminds them that they will soon lose the benefit of his experience and authority, and of the work that he had done, under God's direction, in settling them in the land. Then he proceeds to urge strict obedience to the law of God, reminding them that victory is assured to them, if they will but be true to themselves and their calling as the servants of God, but that as certainly as they neglect to do so, wrath and misery will be their portion. He emphasizes his words by reminding them how amply God had fulfilled his promise, and concludes with a picture of the evil which will befall them if they rebel against God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua called for all Israel, <i>and</i> for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old <i>and</i> stricken in age:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All Israel.</span> By their representatives, as subsequently mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">For their officers</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>). In the original the pronoun is in the singular throughout (see note on Joshua 6:25). <span class="cmt_word">And said unto them.</span> This speech is not, as Calvin, Maurer, and others have suggested, the same as that in ch. 24. (see notes there). Maurer believed that he was the first to entertain this idea, but he has been anticipated by Calvin. It consists largely of quotations from Deuteronomy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-3.htm">Joshua 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God <i>is</i> he that hath fought for you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because of you.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">before</span> you. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-4.htm">Joshua 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Divided unto you by lot.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">caused to fall</span>, the lot being of necessity understood. <span class="cmt_word">These nations that remain.</span> Israel had therefore not driven them out. This, however, need not of necessity be imputed to them as a sin. For, as we have seen, the conquest was to be gradual. No doubt there was enough to be done in consolidating the conquests already made, in settling the tribes in their possessions, to occupy all the days of Joshua, and even possibly a longer period. At least we may he sure that, as long as Joshua lived, the heathen settlements were kept distinct from the Israelitish community, that intermarriages were not allowed, nor rights of citizenship granted to any but the Gibeonites. <span class="cmt_word">Cut off.</span> Joshua's speech here exactly agrees with the statements in <a href="../../par/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28-41</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11, 14, 21</a>. Here at least, if Joshua's speech and the history were taken from two different sources, neither of them precisely accurate, the first postulate of the destructive criticism, we might have expected some slight discrepancy. But Joshua uses a word which implies total extermination, a feature, be it observed, of the campaigns of Moses and Joshua only, and not of the later Israelitish history. <span class="cmt_word">Westward</span>. Literally, the <span class="accented">going down of the sun.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-5.htm">Joshua 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord your God, he shall expel them.</span> Or, <span class="accented">Jehovah your God, He shall thrust them out.</span> Joshua here uses the unusual word found in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-19.htm">Deuteronomy 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4</a>, another instance of quotation from Deuteronomy. The word occurs in the sense of <span class="accented">thrust</span> in <a href="../../par/numbers/35-20.htm">Numbers 35:20, 22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">From out of your sight.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">from before you.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-6.htm">Joshua 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom <i>to</i> the right hand or <i>to</i> the left;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye therefore very courageous.</span> The original is stronger, <span class="accented">Be ye exceedingly courageous</span> (see note on Joshua 1:6). <span class="cmt_word">That is written in the book of the law of Moses.</span> A yet more distinct intimation that the words of Moses had been collected into a book at this early period, and that it was known as the Book of the Law of Moses. It seems incredible that such a book should have been invented at a time when the precepts it contained were lightly regarded, and should have been represented as the proper standard of conduct when every one knew that it could never have been anything of the kind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-7.htm">Joshua 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear <i>by them</i>, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye come not among these nations</span> (see note on ver. 4). We can here perceive that the Israelites, though living among these nations, held no intercourse with them. <span class="cmt_word">Neither make mention of the name of their gods.</span> Cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>, which however is not a verbal quotation of this passage. The LXX. here has, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; the Vulgate simply, "ne juretis in nomine deorum earum." The Hebrew has the signification <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to bring to remembrance, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to praise or celebrate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The former is the better idea here, "let them not be named among you, as becometh saints," let them be quite forgotten, as though they had never been heard of; and this not with a purely theological, but with an ethical purpose, since "fornication and all uncleanness and greediness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; see <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>) were the first principles of their rites (see Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">Nor cause to swear by them.</span> These words are found in connection with what follows in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>. So with "serve" and "bow down" (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, etc.). Here again we have Joshua quoting Deuteronomy as the book of the Law of Moses. According to the "Deuteronomist" theory, the quotation is an audacious fiction, manufactured by the person who was at that moment forging the book from which he pretended to quote. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But cleave unto the Lord your God.</span> Or, <span class="accented">ye shall cleave unto Jehovah</span> your God. The phrase denotes the intimate union between God and the soul (see above, and <a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-9.htm">Joshua 23:9</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but <i>as for</i> you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord your God hath driven out.</span> So the Masora and the LXX. The Vulgate and the margin of our version translate by the future. So Luther also. The next verse is undeniably future. An appeal to their experience, which did not fail (see <a href="../../par/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a>) to be effective as long as the memory of these things was fresh in their minds. So in the Prayer Book of the Church of England we find the appeal, "O God, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have declared unto us, the noble works that thou didst in their days, and in the old time before them." And the passage (<a href="../../par/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1-3</a>), from which the idea of this petition is taken, is an allusion to this speech of Joshua. And we often, in times of faintheartedness or sloth, need to be thus reminded of the moral and spiritual victories of the true Israel, under the true Joshua the Saviour, over the enemies with whom we are forbidden to make a compromise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a></div><div class="verse">One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he <i>it is</i> that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One man of you shall chase a thousand.</span> A quotation from the song of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-11.htm">Joshua 23:11</a></div><div class="verse">Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take good heed to yourselves.</span> This is quoted from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>, word for word. The Hebrew is, <span class="accented">take heed exceedingly to your souls</span>; but the meaning is either "as you value your lives" (Gesenius), or "with all your soul" (Keil). The former appears preferable. A third interpretation, however, "guard your souls diligently," is suggested by a comparison of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9, 15</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a></div><div class="verse">Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, <i>even</i> these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go back.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">return.</span> Cleave. A word (see ver. 8) signifying close and intimate relationship. And the intimacy of the relationship is indicated, as in ver. 8, by the use of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Make marriages with them.</span> No closer or more intimate relationship is possible than this. Nothing, therefore, would be more certain to draw the Israelites away from their allegiance to God, and to seduce them and their children into the false and corrupt worship of the nations around them. "Unde deprecor vos qui fidelis estis, ut ita vitam vestram et conversationem servetis, ne in aliquo vel ipsi scandalum patiamini vel aliis scandalum faciatis; sit in vobis summi studii, summaeque cautelae, ne quis in hanc sanctam congregationem vestram pollutus introeat" (Orig., Hom. 21 on Joshua). Go in unto them. Rather, <span class="accented">go among them.</span> Spoken of the familiar intercourse of friendship. It is equivalent to our words "associate with them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-13.htm">Joshua 23:13</a></div><div class="verse">Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out <i>any of</i> these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Snares and traps.</span> Perhaps, rather, <span class="accented">nets and snares.</span> The LXX., where our translation has snare, has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, and for traps has incorrectly <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>. The snare or <span class="accented">pach</span> was evidently (<a href="../../par/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>) laid upon the earth; but there is no evidence for Gesenius' idea that the <span class="accented">mokesh</span> which follows, there as here, means the stick of the trap, which when displaced involved the bird in the net. As the primary signification of this latter word, which is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> a bow, seems to mean something curved, it is probably a noose or springe. And the word and its cognates are used of involving, or catching, people by its use. Furst's Lexicon confirms this view, which has been independently arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Scourges</span>. The Hebrew word is in the singular. It is translated <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, nails, in the LXX., and <span class="accented">offendiculum in the</span> Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">In your sides.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">on</span> your sides. The words here are very similar to those in <a href="../../par/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. Moses, however, does but use two of the similes of which here we have four. He has, moreover, a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) for thorns, and the word here translated thorns is there substituted for scourges; "thorns in your sides." Joshua crowds together his similes "to describe the shame, and trouble, and oppression which they would bring upon themselves by joining in the idolatry of the Canaanites" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord your God.</span> Here, as elsewhere in this and many other passages, we have in the original, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> your God. It is important to remember that the sacred writer is calling the God of Israel by His own proper name, that by which He was distinguished from the gods of the nations round about. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, this day I <i>am</i> going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, <i>and</i> not one thing hath failed thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not one thing hath failed thereof.</span> This is a good instance of the habit of repetition so common to Hebrew writers. It is to be remembered that they had no italics, no stops, and, owing to the want of copiousness in their language, a great want generally of the means possessed in more modern languages of emphasizing their words. They, therefore, had recourse to what is still a favourite rhetorical artifice, the practice of repetition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-15.htm">Joshua 23:15</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All good things.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">all the good word.</span> That is to say, the prophecies of good had been fulfilled. Joshua uses this as an argument that the evil also will not fail to follow, if Israel provoke God to inflict it. But the memory of these words, and of the great deeds of Jehovah, faded quickly from their minds. And then, like the people of the earth before the flood, like the men of Sodom before it was destroyed, and like many other people since, they turned a deaf ear to the prophecies of evil which faithful souls foresaw and foretold. The warnings of the prophets are but a variation upon the predictions of Moses in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-33</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-14.htm">Deuteronomy 29:14-28</a>, and of Joshua, here addressed to a generation who had brought some of the predicted evil upon themselves, and would not see that by refusing to listen, they would bring upon themselves yet more. How terribly have these predictions been fulfilled! First, the Babylonish captivity; then the disorders and anarchy in a territory which the Jewish people inhabited, but which they were not strong enough to rule; then the siege of and destruction of Jerusalem under Titus with its accompanying horrors. Then the dispersion of the Jews among all the nations, the barbarous and inhuman persecutions they met with in the Middle Ages from priest and monarch alike: the Inquisition in Spain, the contempt and hatred which continued to be felt for them among more enlightened nations, as evidenced in Marlowe's 'Jew of Malta,' and Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice,' in the days of our own Queen Elizabeth. Only in our own age has a brighter day begun to dawn on them, and three thousand years of oppression, relieved only by the brief glories of David and his dynasty, are beginning to be compensated by a share in the world's rewards and honours. <span class="cmt_word">All evil things.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">all the evil word</span>; or <span class="accented">thing</span>; every evil thing, that is, which had been foretold. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-16.htm">Joshua 23:16</a></div><div class="verse">When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Transgressed</span>.
