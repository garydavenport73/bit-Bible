The former word has reference to the physical conditions of the country, its heat and dryness. The LXX. does not attempt to translate the former word and has evidently <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness of Zin.</span> Not to be confounded with the wilderness of Sin (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, 36). This wilderness was on the border of Edom (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>). Thence the border of Judah (which here includes the small portion afterwards allotted to Simeon) extended to the utmost limits of the south (see <a href="../../par/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>). A wall of mountains extends southwestward from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and formed the natural boundary of Judaea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-2.htm">Joshua 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The shore of the salt sea.</span> Literally, the <span class="accented">extremity, i.e.</span>, the <span class="accented">south</span> extremity. <span class="cmt_word">From the bay.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">tongue</span> (so margin). The LXX. translates by <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">ridge.</span> The whole southern portion of the sea is cut off from the rest by a peninsula near Kerak, the ancient Kit of Moab. It is called the Lisan. Whoever was the writer of the Book of Joshua, these details prove him to have had an accurate acquaintance with the geography of Palestine. He was no priestly inventor of fables attached to the temple at Jerusalem. Canon Tristram gives a vivid description of the neighbourhood in his 'Land of Israel,' ch. 15. The ridge of Jebel Usdum - one large mass of rock salt - on the west of this "tongue" of water, the salt marsh of the Sebkha on the southwest, with its treeless waste - "not a plant or a leaf could be seen save just under the hills" - and its mirage like that of Sahara, the barren outline of the Lisan itself, to the eastward rising to an elevation of from five to six hundred feet, and the fertile oasis of the Ghor-es-Safieh at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, give an unique character to this remarkable region. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a></div><div class="verse">And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim</span>. Or, perhaps, <span class="accented">and it went to the southward of Maaleh-acrabbim</span>, translated in <a href="../../par/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>, "the ascent of Acrabbim." The literal meaning of Maaleh-acrabbim is Scorpion Rise (see <a href="../../par/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>). Keil thinks that it was a pass in the Mount Halak, or the Smooth Mountain, mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a>. "De Saulcy suggests the Wady Zouara, and testifies to the scorpions found under every pebble" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 113). And Ainsworth, 'Travels in Asia Minor,' 2:354, says that some spots are almost uninhabitable in consequence. Knobel supposes it to be the pass es-Sufah on the road between Petra and Hebron. But the border of Judah seems to have gone in a southwesterly direction. <span class="cmt_word">To Zin.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">in the direction of</span> Zin. <span class="cmt_word">On the south side unto Kadesh-barnea</span>. Or, as above, <span class="accented">southward of Kadesh-barnea.</span> The exact position of Kadesh-Burnea has not been ascertained. It was between the wilderness of Zin and that of Paran (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>). Dean Stanley identifies it with Petra, which was about 30 miles in a northeasterly direction from the Gulf of Akaba on the Red Sea, and close to Mount Her. A more recent traveller (see Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' pp. 366-376) identifies it with Ain Gadis, about 60 miles to the westward of Petra, and he claims Winer, Kurz, Kalisch, and Knobel as supporters of his view. The latter founds his view on the discovery of Ain Gadis by Rowlands, and supports it by the authority of Ritter. Ritter, however, as his translator informs us, embodied the results of the investigations of Mr. Rowlands' while his work was preparing for the press, and did not give the matter that full consideration which he was accustomed to do. The chief objection to it is that (see vex. 1) Ain Gadis can hardly be described as on "the border of Edom." The general view is that it lay somewhat to the northeast of Hezron and to the northwest of Petra, at the foot of the range of mountains which form the southern boundary of Judesa. Here the spies brought their report to Moses (ch. 14:6, 7; <a href="../../par/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>). Here Miriam was buried, and where Moses incurred the wrath of God from his mode of working the miracle which supplied the Israelites with water (<a href="../../par/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>.). It was "a city in the uttermost border" of Edom (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>), and it was some distance from Mount Hor, for we find it described as a journey (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22</a>); and by passing from Kadesh to Mount Hor and thence by the way of the Red Sea, the Israelites "compassed the land of Edom" (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>), a fact which seems to prove that Petra and Kadesh-barnea were not the same place. Kadesh is supposed by M. Chabas to be the "Qodesh of the country of the Amaor," or Amorites, in the monuments of Seti I. and Rameses II. It is depicted as "on a hillside with a stream on one side," and is thus distinguished from Qodesh of the Kheta or Hittites, which is in a flat country beside a lake (Tomkins, 'Studies of the Time of Abraham,' p. 84). <span class="cmt_word">Fetched a compass to Karkaa.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">was deflected in the direction of Karkaa.</span> Nothing is known of the places here mentioned. Cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>, where Karkaa is not mentioned, but the deflection in the neighbourhood of Asmon is. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>From thence</i> it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The river of Egypt</span> (see above, <a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>). "Westward, as far as Egypt, there is a sandy, salt, barren, unfruitful, and uninhabitable waste" (Knobel). The land, he adds, is better near Gaza, but near the sea it is still pure waste. <span class="cmt_word">And the goings out of that coast were at the sea.</span> The word coast, derived through the French from the Latin <span class="accented">costa</span>, signifies, like it, a <span class="accented">side.</span> It is now used only of the border formed by the sea, but at an earlier period it had a wider signification. The Hebrew word is translated "border" in ver. 1. The meaning is that the boundary line of Judah ran as far as the sea. <span class="cmt_word">This shall be your south coast.</span> Or, <span class="accented">this shall be to you the southern bound</span>ary. The historian here quotes the directions given to Moses in <a href="../../par/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a>, with the evident intention of pointing out that the south border of the children of Israel coincided with that of the tribe of Judah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the east border <i>was</i> the salt sea, <i>even</i> unto the end of Jordan. And <i>their</i> border in the north quarter <i>was</i> from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the end of Jordan.</span> The spot where it emptied itself into the Dead Sea. <span class="cmt_word">The bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan.</span> As in ver. 3, the word here translated bay is tongue in the original. What is meant is that the northern boundary started from the point where the Jordan entered the Dead Sea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-6.htm">Joshua 15:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beth-hogla</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/18-19.htm">Joshua 18:19</a>). It is still known as <span class="accented">Ain Hadjla</span> or <span class="accented">Hajla</span>, where, says Keil, a beautiful spring of fresh and clear water is to be found. The place lies about two miles from Jordan. Beth-hogla means "the house of the partridge." "Leaving the probable site of the ancient Gilgal and advancing southward along the pilgrims' route to the Jordan, an hour and a quarter brings us to the spring Kin Hajla, in a small and well-watered grove" (Ritter). He adds, "Robinson and Wilson both recognised in the name Hails the ancient Canaanitish city Beth-hogla." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-arabah.</span> Or "the house of the Arabah" or desert. Its site is not known (see ver. 61 and <a href="../../par/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18, 22</a>). The Beth-arabah in ver. 61, however, must have been another place, since it was in the wilderness of Judaea, not far from the Dead Sea. <span class="cmt_word">The stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.</span> All we know of this stone is that it was westward of Beth-arabah. The boundary of Benjamin in ch. 18, is mentioned in precisely reverse order, and since here the stone was on the ascent from Beth-araba, and there (ver. 17) it is described as on the descent from Geliloth, it must have been on the side of the declivity. Of Bohan nothing further is known. We must understand here, as in many other places of Scripture, <span class="accented">descendant</span> by "son" (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that <i>is</i> before the going up to Adummim, which <i>is</i> on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Toward Debir.</span> Not the Debir of ch. 10. <span class="cmt_word">The valley of Achor</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>). This is now the Wady Kelt. <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal</span>. Keil says that this is not the Gilgal where the Israelites first encamped. It is called Geliloth, or "circles," in <a href="../../par/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>, where the same place is obviously meant as here. The question is one of some difficulty. If it be not the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>, which is described as being eastward of Jericho, still less can it be Jiljiliah (see note on Joshua 9:6) which was near Bethel, and therefore on the northern border of Benjamin. In that case the only supposition that will meet the facts in this case is that Gilgal, which signifies a wheel or circle, was the common name given to all the Israelitish encampments. But there seems no reason to doubt that the Gilgal of <a href="../../par/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a> is meant. This is Ewald's view in his 'History of Israel,' 2:245. <span class="cmt_word">Adummim,</span> or "the red (places)," has been identified with Maledomim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Maaleh Adummim, or Talat el Dumm (Conder), on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Jerome explains it as "ascensus ruforum sen rubentium propter sanguinem qui iltic erebro a latronibus funditur." Every one will at once call to mind the narrative in St. <a href="../../par/luke/10.htm">Luke 10</a>, which has no doubt suggested this explanation. But at one particular point in the route from Jerusalem to Jericho a "large mass of purplish rock" is found (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 424, note). It was called "terra ruffa," "the red earth," from the colour of the ground, and recent travellers state that it is called the "red field" still, from this cause. Conder tells us the name is derived from "the brick-red marks here found amid a district of red chalk (see also Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake in Pal. Expl. Fund Quart. Paper, April, 1874). So Knobel speaks, on the authority of numberless travellers of "der rothen Farbe des dortigen gesteins." And the Quarterly Paper just quoted mentions the "bright limestone and marl." <span class="cmt_word">Which is on the south aide of the river.</span> The <span class="accented">Nahal</span>, or summer torrent, in the original; "the Wady Kelt, south of Riha" (Knobel). <span class="cmt_word">The waters of Eu-shemesh,</span> or the fountain of the sun, supposed to be Kin Hand, or the "Apostles' well," near Bethany. There is an <span class="accented">Arak</span> (cave) <span class="accented">esh Shems</span>, about two miles off. All these places have been identified on or near the pilgrims' route to the Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">Enrogel</span> (see ch. 18:17). It was close by Jerusalem, and was where Jonathan and Ahimaaz lingered to gain tidings for David, and where Adonijah repaired to hold the great feast when he endeavoured to obtain the kingdom. "Now Kin Um ed Deraj in the Kedron Valley" (Conder). Vandevelde supposes it to be Bir Eyub, Joab's well, at the point where the Kedron Valley meets the Gai Hinnom. This seems most probable. <span class="cmt_word">The valley of the son of Hinnom.</span> The word here for valley (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) signifies properly a deep cleft in the rock, through which no water flows. The valley of Hinnom has been generally taken to be the deep valley running from west to east, and lying to the west and south of Jerusalem, described by Tobler as forked at its northwestern end, bending to the southward about its middle, and joining the valley of Jehoshaphat at its eastern extremity. In the Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund for October, 1878, however, it is contended that the now partially filled up Tyropceon Valley, running through the city, is the valley or ravine of Hinnom. The manner in which this is demonstrated reminds the reader somewhat of a proposition in Euclid, and the question arises whether Euclid's method be exactly applicable to a point of this kind. The arguments used are not without force, but no notice is taken of the peculiar position of the valley of Rephaim (see next note but one), which, we learn from the sacred historian, was so placed that its extremity coincided with the mountain which closed the ravine of Hinnom at its western side. If the Tyropoeon Valley answers to this description, it may be accepted as the true valley of Hinnom, but not otherwise. Mr. Birch incorrectly cites Gesenius in favour of his theory; and the most recent discoveries appear to have thrown discredit upon it. The most weighty argument in favour of his theory is that a comparison of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a> with <a href="../../par/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3-8</a>, leads to the supposition that Jerusalem was partly in Benjamin and partly in Judah (see, however, <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). This valley, called sometimes Tophet, and sometimes, by a corruption of the Hebrew, Gehenna, whatever its situation may have been, is conspicuous in the after history of Israel. This deep and retired spot was the seat of all the worst abominations of the idol worship to which the Jews afterwards became addicted. Here Solomon reared high places for Moloch (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>). Here children were sacrificed at the hideous rites of that demon god (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2, 4</a>). It was defiled by Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10, 13, 14</a>), and was looked upon in later times as an abomination (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>). There the carcases of animals were east to be burned, and hence it is used by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>) as the type of the utmost wrath of God. It is hardly possible to suppose that there is no allusion to Tophet and its fiery sacrifices in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>, in spite of the different form of the word, to which some scholars, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Gesenius, assign an Aryan rather than a Semitic origin, and in spite of the fact that the LXX. suspects no such allusion there. St. James alone, beside the writers of the Gospels, mentions it (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>), "<span class="accented">set</span> <span class="accented">on fire</span> of hell," or <span class="accented">Gehenna.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same <i>is</i> Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that <i>lieth</i> before the valley of Hinnom westward, which <i>is</i> at the end of the valley of the giants northward:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The south side of the Jebusite.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">the shoulder of the Jebusite from</span> (or <span class="accented">on</span>) <span class="accented">the south</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-39.htm">1 Kings 7:39</a>, margin). Thus Jerusalem lay to the north of the border, in the tribe of Benjamin. <span class="cmt_word">The same is Jerusalem.</span> Formerly called Jebus, from the Jebusites who dwelt there (<a href="../../par/judges/19-11.htm">Judges 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4</a>). The city lay on the borders of Judah and Benjamin (see note on Joshua 10:1). <span class="cmt_word">The valley of the giants.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>). The word here translated valley is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>. In the former part it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (see note on last verse). The word here used signifies originally <span class="accented">depth</span>, and is applied to wide valleys embosomed among lofty hills. Such were the valley of Elah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2, 19</a>); the King's Dale (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>); the valley of Siddim (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>), of Jezreel (<a href="../../par/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>). "The word Emek shows that this was neither a winter torrent nor a narrow, dry ravine, and it is best identified with its traditional site, the shallow basin west of the watershed south of Jerusalem, now called el Bukei'a" (Conder). We read of this valley in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18, 22</a>. From these passages we may gather a confirmation of the view above expressed, that the valley here meant is an open valley, since only in such a valley could the Philistine army take up a position. It gradually narrows towards the southwest. On the south it extends as far as Bethlehem. The range of mountains which lie to the west of the valley of Hinnom from the northern boundary of the plain or valley of Rephaim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which <i>is</i> Kirjathjearim:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was drawn.</span> Or, <span class="accented">extended. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The fountain of the waters of Nephtoah.</span> If these be identified with En Etam, as is done by the Rabbis (whom Conder follows), and if we suppose it to have supplied Jerusalem with water by the aqueduct which ran from a point southwest of Betlehem to Jerusalem, we must place it south of Bethlehem, and imagine that the border ran directly south here. Far more probable is the notion of Vandevelde, which places it northwest of Jerusalem, at Ain Lifta. Conder's view is dominated by the situation he has assigned to Kirjath-jearim (see note on Joshua 9:17). If the view there given in these notes is sound, the border now ran in a northwesterly direction from Jerusalem to within five miles of Gibeon (see also note on Joshua 18:14). <span class="cmt_word">Kirjath-jearim.</span> See <a href="../../par/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>. To the authorities mentioned there in favour of Kuriet el Enab we may add Knobel, Ritter, and Tristram, in his last book, 'Bible Lands.' The view taken above corresponds to the minuteness of detail with which the boundary is given. To place Nephtoah south of Bethlehem and Kirjath-jearim at 'Arma would make the boundary far less distinct. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which <i>is</i> Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Compassed</span>. Or, deflected (see ver. 4). This is in accordance with the view taken above. The border line which had run northwest from Jerusalem now bent backwards in a southwesterly direction, and followed the ridge towards Chesalon (see note on Chesalon). Mount Seir. Not the dwelling place of Esau, afterwards the country of the Edomites (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>), but a range running southwestward from Kirjath-jearim, part of which is still known as Sairah, or Saris, "auf welchem <span class="accented">Saris</span> und <span class="accented">Mihsir</span> liegen" (Kuobel). Since Kirjath-jearim means the "city of the forests," and Seir means "hairy," we may conjecture that the name was given to the ridge on account of its wooded character. This also is implied by "Mount Jearim." <span class="cmt_word">The side of Mount Jearim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">the shoulder</span> (see above, ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Which is Chesalon.</span> This is identified with <span class="accented">Kesia</span>, a point on the summit of the ridge stretching southwest from Kirjath-jearim. The fact that the border passed northward of Chesalon is a confirmation of the view taken above. We learn from <a href="../../par/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a> (cf. ver. 33 of this chapter), that the border passed by Zorah and Eshtaol in the Shephelah, through a neighbourhood described in Conder's Handbook as "an open corn country." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shemesh.</span> The "house of the sun," identified with the modern Ain (or fountain of) Shems. It is called Irshemesh in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>. It was close to the border of the Philistines, and was the scene of the transactions recorded in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a>. The propinquity to the Philistines appears to have affected the principles of its inhabitants, and their conduct contrasts most unfavourably with that of the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim. This was the more disgraceful, in that Beth-shemesh (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>) was a priestly city, and being inhabited by those whose "lips should keep knowledge," might have been expected to set a better example. It was required to furnish Solomon's household with provisions (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-9.htm">1 Kings 4:9</a>), it witnessed the defeat and capture of Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11-13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>) by Joash, king of Israel. It fell into the hands of the Philistines at the time of the decay of the Jewish power under Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). The name, like Baal-Gad and Ashtaroth-Karnaim, is worthy of remark, as pointing to the character of the early Phoenician worship. <span class="cmt_word">Timnah.</span> Sometimes called Timnath in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1-6</a>), and Timnatha in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-43.htm">Joshua 19:43</a>.

This important Philistine city (see <a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>) lay close to the northern border of Judah. As a matter of fact, however, the tribe of Judah never succeeded in permanently occupying this territory, which only fell under their yoke during the reigns of David and Solomon. The cities of the Philistines were, it is true, most of them captured (<a href="../../par/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>), but we soon find the Philistines once more in possession of them (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Northward</span>.

It has been argued from the variations that the one passage was not copied from the other, but that both were derived from a common document. No such conclusion, however, can be safely drawn from the text. For first, the present narrative deals exclusively with this portion of the history of Caleb. That in Judges, down to ver. 12, deals more generally with the subject, including the exploits of Caleb, under the general history of the progress of Judah. But from the time that the history becomes that of Caleb in particular, the agreement between the two narratives is verbal, including the very unusual word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;</span>, with one or two most insignificant exceptions. Thus we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> interpolated in <a href="../../par/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>, and Othniel (or Kenez) is spoken of as the <span class="accented">younger</span> brother of Caleb. But unless we hold that it was a sacred duty of the writer in Judges to reproduce every single word of the narrative in Joshua, there is nothing whatever that can support the conclusion that the writer in Judges was not copying the earlier narrative. The variations are such as would naturally happen where a writer was transferring, a narrative to his pages with a desire to give the exact sense of the original without tying himself to every particular word. Since the use of inverted commas has been introduced we can find multitudes of instances where a writer, when professing to quote another accurately, has introduced far more variations into his quotation than are to be found here, where the writer, though quoting the Book of Joshua, and quoting it correctly, does not say that he is doing so. No one doubts that Jeremiah in ch. 48. is quoting <a href="../../par/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>, although the passages are not verbally coincident. We may safely regard this quotation of the Book of Joshua in that of Judges, as under all ordinary laws of criticism an evidence that the former book was in existence when the latter was written, just as the quotations of Deuteronomy in Joshua may naturally be taken as evidence that the Book of Deuteronomy was in existence when that of Joshua was composed. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Jephunneh.</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A part.</span> Literally, a <span class="accented">lot. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Among</span>.

The word Negeb signifies dry (see note on Negeb, <a href="../../par/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). It must be remembered that it became the word for south, because the south of Palestine was an arid tract. Therefore Achsah must be understood as saying, "Thou hast given me a dry country, give me also a reservoir of water." The Vulgate translates Negeb twice over, "australem et arentem" (arentem only <a href="../../par/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>). The LXX. translates both Negeb and Gulloth as proper names. But in the parallel passage in Judges Negeb is translated "south," and Gulloth appears as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as if from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> to remove.

It is, however, occasionally used in a less strict sense, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24</a>. Though the south country was in the main an arid region, yet its intersection by numerous wadys, with their attendant streams, provided fertile spots at intervals, where the traveller might rest, cattle might be watered, and corn and other produce raised. The only places of any importance in Scripture history mentioned here are Beersheba (see <a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>), and Hormah (see <a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>; and cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>; and <a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>).

Ziklag is famous as the residence of David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). It is noteworthy that t was given to him by Achish, king of Gath, in whose possession it therefore was at that time.

These cities of the Philistines had, like Gibeon, daughter cities dependent on them, and must therefore have been, like Gibeon, "great cities as the royal cities" (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). They do not appear to have come under regal government till later times (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8, 11</a>, with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). "Around it (Gezer) and along the sides were distributed a series of small isolated centres of agglomeration .... This disposition to scatter itself, of which Gezer surely does not offer us the only specimen, explains in a striking manner the Biblical phrase, 'the city and her daughters'" (Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper, Jan., 1874). This explanation, however, is doubtful (see <a href="../../par/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>). According to Knobel, this passage cannot have been written by the Elohist, because he confines himself to the description of the cities the Israelites actually possessed. Why a lair writer, writing presumably when Israel's fortunes were at a lower ebb, should have added a description of the territory Israel <span class="accented">did not</span> possess, he does not explain.

Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 100) descants on the home-like character of the scenery and vegetation to an Englishman, and remarks on the contrast between the life, activity, and industry displayed there, as contrasted with the desolation of the greater part of Palestine. A later traveller, who would not, of course, be so struck with the resemblance to English scenery, speaks of the fertility of the ground as a matter of possibility, rather than of fact. The rocky soil, when broken up by the combined influences of heat, rain, and frost, is, like the soil of other rocky districts, extremely susceptible of cultivation when laid out in terraces. He remarks how the signs of ancient cultivation in this manner are to be seen on all sides, and laments the misrule which has converted the "land flowing with milk and honey" into a wilderness (see Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' ch. 19, and note on Joshua 10:40). The time has not yet come for the Jews, now asserting their ancient greatness in statesmanship, literature, and art in every country in the civilised world, to return to their own land. Not till then, it is to be feared, will the prophecy in <a href="../../par/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35</a>. be fulfilled, and "the desert rejoice, and the wilderness blossom as the rose, while waters break out in the wilderness and streams in the desert, the parched ground becoming a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water."

"That long line of hills was the beginning of the 'hill country of Judaea,' and when we began to ascend it the first answer to our inquiries after the route told us that it was 'Carmel,' on which Nabal fed his flocks, and close below its long ranges was the hill and ruins of Ziph," close above the hill of Maon, Wilson also ('Lands of the Bible,' 1:380) makes the same remark. Maon is to be remembered as David's hiding place from the enmity of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-24.htm">1 Samuel 23:24-26</a>), and as the home of Nabal (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>).

The prophet Amos was one of its herdsmen (<a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>). We learn from 1 Maccab. 9:33, etc., that it was near Jordan, and had a waste district in its vicinity. It has been identified with Teku'a, two hours south of Bethlehem. Of Bethlehem itself, the home of Ruth and David, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, it is unnecessary to speak. But the incidents related concerning Bethlehem in <a href="../../par/judges/17.htm">Judges 17, 19</a>. (which seem to indicate that the author of the book had special information about Bethlehem), as well as the narrative of the Book of Ruth, lead us to suppose that the verse inserted here by the LXX. is genuine, since Bethlehem was, in early times, a town of sufficient importance to be noticed in a list like this, and that its omission in the Hebrew text is due to the mistake of some transcriber.

It is described by Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 197) as "a wilderness, but no desert." Herbage is to be found there, but no trees, no signs of the cultivation formerly bestowed upon the hill country (see above, ver. 48). And the fewness of the cities in early times is a proof that its character has not been altered by time. The hills, says Canon Tristram, are of a "peculiar desolate tameness," and are intersected by the traces of winter watercourses, seaming the sides of the monotonous round-topped hills. Other writers describe this country in less favourable terms, denying it even the scanty herbage found there by Canon Tristram.

Here the ruins of the ancient city of Hazezon Tamar, or "the felling of the palm trees" (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>), are to be found, a city perhaps "the oldest in the world," may still be seen. "The cluster of camphire" (or rather of henna, the plant with which Oriental women stained their nails - <a href="../../par/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>) may still be found there, and its perennial torrent dashes still into the Dead Sea.
