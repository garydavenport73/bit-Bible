Take heed lest the unusual dainties on the table tempt thee to excess, which may lead not only to unseemly behaviour, but also to unruly speech, revealing of secrets, etc. But the latter words may also be tendered, "him that is," or, "<span class="accented">who</span> is before thee." And this gives a very appropriate sense. The guest is enjoined to fix his attention, not on the delicate food, but on the host, who is his superior, and able to exalt and to destroy him (compare the cautious maxims in Ecclus. 13:2, 6, 7, 11, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/23-2.htm">Proverbs 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <i>be</i> a man given to appetite.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</span> "Stab thy gluttony," Wordsworth. Restrain thyself by the strongest measures, convince thyself that thou art in the utmost peril, if thou art a glutton or wine bibber (Ecclus. 34 [31]:12). The LXX. gives a different turn to the injunction, "And apply (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>) thy hand, knowing that it behoves thee to prepare such things." This is like the warning of Siracides, in the chapter quoted above, where the disciple is admonished not to attend the banquets of rich men, lest he should be tempted to vie with them, and thus ruin himself by attempting to return their civilities in the same lavish manner. The earlier commentators have used the above verses as a lesson concerning the due and reverent partaking of the Holy Communion, thus: "When you approach the table of Christ, consider diligently what is represented by the elements before you, and have discernment and faith, lest you eat and drink unworthily; and after communicating walk warily, mortify all evil desires, live as in the presence of the Lord Jesus, the Giver of the feast."

Far from being a sign of favour and good will, the seeming honour is deceptive and dangerous. We all know Horace's lines, 'Ars Poet.,' 434, etc. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Reges dicuntur multi, urgere culullis<br />Et torquere mero, quem perspexisse laborant,<br />Au sit amicitia dignus."</span> Hitzig quotes the Eastern proverb, "He who eats of the sultan's soup burns his lips, even though it he after a length of time." We have too the Indian saying, "An epicure digs his grave with his teeth," which is true in more senses than one. "Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill," says Siracides (Ecclus. 9:13); "so shalt thou not be troubled with fear of death: and if thou come unto him, commit no fault, lest he presently take away thy life; remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city." Then for the reasons which induce a ruler to ply a guest with wine, we have, "In vino veritas, quod est in corde sobrii, est in ore ebrii."

Talmud, "He who augments his riches augments his cares." Erasmus, 'Adag,,' quotes or writes -   <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Jupiter ementitur opes mortalibus ipse,<br />Sic visum ut fuerit, cuicunque, bonove, malove?</span> Septuagint, "If thou art poor, measure not thyself (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) with a rich man, but in thy wisdom refrain thyself."

In the Authorized Version the word "heart" occurs twice in this verse, but the Hebrew words are different. The first is <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "breath," equivalent to "mind;" the second is <span class="accented">leb</span>, "heart." The Vulgate paraphrases the clause, <span class="accented">Quoniam in similitudinem arioli et conjectoris, aestimat quod ignorat</span>, "For like a soothsayer or diviner he conjectures that of which he is ignorant." <span class="cmt_word">Eat and drink, saith he to thee.</span> He professes to make you welcome, and with seeming cordiality invites you to partake of the food upon his table. <span class="cmt_word">But his heart is not with thee.</span> He is not glad to see you enjoy yourself, and his pressing invitation is empty verbiage with no heart in it. The Septuagint, pointing differently, translates, "For as if one should swallow a hair, so he eats and drinks." The Greek translators take the gnome to apply to one who invites an envious man to his table, and finds him eating his food as if it disgusted him. They go on, "Bring him not in to thee, nor eat thy morsel with him; for (ver. 8) he will vomit it up, and outrage thy fair words." In agreement with the gnome above, we find in the Talmud, "My son, eat not the bread of the covetous, nor sit thou at his table. The bread of the covetous is only pain and anguish; the bread of the generous man is a source of health and joy."

The combination of glutton and wine bibber was used as a reproach against our blessed Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>). The versions of Jerome and the LXX. point to the contributed entertainments, where each guest brought some article to the meal, like our picnics.

Tunc siquidem cor hominum Deo datur, quando omnia cogitatio terminatur in eum, gyrat et circumflectitur super eum, et nihil vult possidere praeter eum. Sicque colligato sibi animo, eum diligit, ut sine ipso amarus sit omnis amor.

A narrow pit is one with a narrow month, from which, if one falls into it, it is difficult to extricate one's self. The verse indicates the seductive nature of the vice of unchastity: how easy it is to be led into it! how difficult to rise from it! Thus St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 11, in 1 Corinthians'), "When by unclean desire the soul is made captive, even as a cloud and mist darken the eyes of the body, so that desire intercepts the foresight of the mind, and suffers no one to see any distance before him, either precipice, or hell, or fear; but thenceforth, having that deceit as a tyrant over him, he comes to be easily vanquished by sin; and there is raised up before his eyes as it were a partition wall, and no windows in it, which suffers not the ray of righteousness to shine in upon the mind, the absurd conceits of lust enclosing it as with a rampart on all sides. And then, and from that time forward, the unchaste woman is everywhere meeting him - before his eyes, before his mind, before his thoughts, in station and presence. And as the blind, although they stand at high noon beneath the very central point of the heaven, receive not the light, their eyes being fast closed up; just so these also, though ten thousand doctrines of salvation sound in their ears from all quarters, having their soul preoccupied with this passion, stop their ears against all discourses of that kind. And they know it well who have made the trial. But God forbid that you should know it from actual experience!" The LXX. has changed the allusion: "For a strange house is a pierced wine jar (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and a strange well is narrow," where the idea seems to be that the private well, which is dug for the convenience of one family only, is not to be relied upon, and will yield not enough to supply others' wants. Hence would arise a warning against coveting a neighbour's wife. There is a Greek proverb about drawing wine into pierced jars (Xen., 'OEcon.,' 7:40).

For if thou set thine eyes on goblets and cups, afterwards thou shalt walk more bare than a pestle (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." This last expression, <span class="accented">pistillo nudior</span>, is a proverb. Regarding the danger of looking on seductive objects, the Arab, in his sententious language, says, "The contemplation of vice is vice." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/23-32.htm">Proverbs 23:32</a></div><div class="verse">At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the last it biteth like a serpent.</span> Wine is like the subtle poison of a serpent, which affects the whole body, and produces the most fatal consequences (comp. Ecclus. 21:2). <span class="accented">Nachash</span> is the generic name for any of the larger tribe of snakes (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, etc.); the poisonous nature of its bite was, of course, well known (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stingeth like an adder.</span> The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">tsiphoni</span>, which is usually rendered "cockatrice" in the Authorized Version, but the particular species intended has not been accurately identified. There was some confusion in men's minds as to the organ which inflicted the poisonous wound. Thus a psalmist says, "They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent" (<a href="../../par/psalms/140-3.htm">Psalm 140:3</a>). But the verb "sting" is to be taken in the sense of puncturing, making a wound. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicut regulus venena diffundet</span>, "It will diffuse its poison like a basilisk:" Septuagint, "But at the last he stretches himself like one stricken by a serpent, and the venom is diffused through him as by a horned snake (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a></div><div class="verse">Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - The excitement occasioned by wine is now described. <span class="cmt_word">Thine eyes shall behold strange women.</span> Ewald, Delitzsch, and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> to mean "strange things," as affording a better parallel to the "perverse things" of the next clause. In this case the writer intends to denote the fantastic, often dreadful, images produced on the brain by the feverish condition of the inebriated. But the often denounced connection between drunkenness and incontinence, the constant reference to "strange women" in this book, and the general consensus of the versions, lead one to uphold the rendering of the Authorized Version. It seems, too, somewhat meagre to note these illusions as one of the terrible effects of intemperance, omitting all mention of the unbridling of lust, when the eyes look out for and rove after unchaste women. <span class="cmt_word">Thine heart shall utter perverse things</span> (comp <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). The drunkard's notions are distorted, and his words partake of the same character; he confuses right and wrong; he says things which he would never speak if he were in full possession of his senses. Septuagint, "When thine eyes  shall see a strange woman, then thy mouth shall speak perverse things." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/23-34.htm">Proverbs 23:34</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he that lieth down in the midst of the sea.</span> The dazed and unconscious condition of a drunkard is described by one familiar with sea life, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>, etc.; Psalms 107:23, etc. The Hebrew has "in the heart of the sea" (<a href="../../par/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the depth. Many understand the idea to be that the drunkard is compared to a man asleep in a frail boat, or to one slumbering on board a ship sunk in the trough of the sea. But the "lying" here does not imply sleep, but rather immersion. The inebriated person is assimilated to one who is drowned or drowning, who is cut off from all his former pursuits and interests in life, and has become unconscious of surrounding circumstances. This much more exactly represents the case than any notion of sloping amid danger. Septuagint, "Thou shalt lie as in the heart of the sea." <span class="cmt_word">Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast;</span> the extreme point of the sailyard, where no one could lie without the greatest peril of falling off. The drunkard is exposed to dangers of all kinds from being unable to take care of himself, and yet is all the time unconscious of his critical situation. Corn. a Lapide, followed by Plumptre, considers that the cradle, or look out, on the top of the mast is meant, where, if the watchman slept, he would be certain to endanger his life. Vulgate, "like a pilot fallen asleep, who has dropped the tiller," and is therefore on the way to shipwreck. Septuagint, "as a pilot in a great storm." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a></div><div class="verse">They have stricken me, <i>shalt thou say, and</i> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <i>and</i> I felt <i>it</i> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - The drunkard is represented as speaking to himself. The LXX. inserts, "and thou shelf say" as the Authorized Version does: They have stricken me, shall thou say, and <span class="cmt_word">I was not sick;</span> or, <span class="accented">I was not </span>hurt. The drunken man has been beaten (perhaps there is a reference to the "contentions," ver. 29), but the blows did not pain him; his condition has rendered him insensible to pain. He has some vague idea the he has suffered certain rough treatment at the hands of his companions, but it has made no impression on him. They have beaten me, and I felt it not; did not even know it. Far from recognizing his degradation and profiting by the merzed chastisement which he has incurred, he is represented as looking forward with pleasure to a renewal of his debauch, when his drunken sleep shall be over. <span class="cmt_word">When shall I awake? I will seek it</span> (wine) <span class="cmt_word">yet again.</span> Some take <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">mathai</span>) as the relative conjunctive: "When I awake I will seek it again;" but it is always used interrogatively, and the expression thus becomes more animated, as Delitzsch observes. It is as though the drunkard has to yield to the effects of his excess and sleep off his intoxication, but he is. as it were, all the time longing to be able to rouse himself and recommence his orgies. We have had words put into the mouth of the sluggard (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>). The whole verse is rendered by the LXX thus: "Thou shalt say, They smote me, and I was not pained, and they mocked me, and I knew it not. When will it be morning, that I may go and seek those with whom I may consort?" The author of the 'Tractutus de Conscientia' appended to St. Bernard's works, applies this paragraph to the cuss of an evil conscience indurated by wicked habits and insensible to correction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
