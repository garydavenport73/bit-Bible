To all intents and purposes this is a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter, for inasmuch as that described the benefits, spiritual and moral, which follow from the pursuit of Wisdom, in promoting godliness and providing safety from evil companions, so this in like manner depicts the gain flowing from Wisdom, the happiness of the man who finds Wisdom, and the favour which he meets with both with God and man. The discourse embraces exhortations to obedience (vers. 1-4), to reliance on God (vers. 5, 6) against self-sufficiency and self-dependence (vers. 7, 8), to self-sacrificing devotion to God (vers. 9, 10), to patient submission to God's afflictive dispensations (vers. 11, 12), and concludes with pointing out the happy gain of Wisdom, her incomparable value, and wherein that value consists (vers. 13-18). It is noticeable that in each case the exhortation is accompanied with a corresponding promise  of reward (vers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and these promises are brought forward with the view to encourage the observance of the duties recommended or enjoined. Jehovah is the central point to which all the exhortations converge. Obedience, trust, self-sacrificing devotion, submission, are successively brought forward by the teacher as due to God, and the persons in whom they are exhibited are truly happy in finding Wisdom. The transition in thought from the former to the latter part of the discourse is easy and natural. Obedience and trust are represented as bringing favour, guidance, and health - in a word, prosperity. But God is not only to be honoured in times of prosperity, but also in adversity his loving hand is to be recognized; and in this submission to his will is true wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) serves to externally connect this discourse with the preceding. <span class="cmt_word">Forget not my law.</span> This admonition bears a strong resemblance to that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, though the terms employed are somewhat different, <span class="accented">torah</span> and <span class="accented">mits'oth</span> here occupying the place respectively of <span class="accented">musar</span> and <span class="accented">torah</span> in that passage. <span class="accented">My law</span> (<span class="accented">torathi</span>), is literally, <span class="accented">my teaching</span>, or <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, from the root <span class="accented">yarah</span>, "to teach." The <span class="accented">torah</span> is the whole body of salutary doctrine, and designates "Law" from the standpoint of teaching. Forgetting here is not So much oblivion arising from defective memory, as a wilful disregard and neglect of the admonitions of the teacher. <span class="cmt_word">Thine heart</span> (<span class="accented">libekha</span>); Vulgate<span class="accented">, cor</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and so the sum total of the affections. <span class="cmt_word">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">yitstsor</span>, from <span class="accented">notsar</span>, "to keep, or observe that which is commanded." The word is of frequent occurrence in the Proverbs, and appears about twenty-five times. <span class="cmt_word">My commandments</span> (<span class="accented">mits'othay</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">praecepta mea</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my precepts. The Hebrew verb from which it is derived means "to command, or prescribe." The law and commandments here alluded to are those which immediately follow, from ver. 3 onwards. The three main ideas combined in this verse are remembrance, affection, and obedience. Remembering the law or teaching will depend, to a large extent, on the interest felt in that law; and the admonition to "forget not" is an admonition to give "earnest heed," so that the law or teaching may be firmly fixed in the mind. In using the words, "let thy heart keep," the teacher goes to the root of the matter. There may be an historical remembrance of, or an intellectual assent to, the commandments, but these are insufficient, for the keeping of the commandments must be based on the recognition of the fact that the affections of the heart are to be employed in the service of God, the keeping of the commandments is to be a labour of love. Again, the expression, "keep my commandments," implies, of course, external conformity to their requirements: we are "to observe to do them" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-1.htm">Deuteronomy 8:1</a>); but it implies, further, spiritual obedience, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an obedience with which love is combined (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-20.htm">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>), and which arises from the inward principles of the heart being in harmony with the spirit of the commandments (see Wardlaw). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Length of days</span> (<span class="accented">orek yamim</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">longitudo dierum.</span> The expression is literally "extension of days," and signifies the prolongation of life, its duration to the appointed limit - a meaning which is brought out in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "length of days," the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being used, not of existence, but of the time and course of life. It occurs again in ver. 16, and also in <a href="../../par/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. "Length of days" is represented as a blessing in the Old Testament, depending, however, as in the present instance, on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Thus in the fifth commandment it is appended to the honouring of parents (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and it was promised to Solomon, at Gibeon, on the condition that he walked in the way, statutes, and commandments of God (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>). The promise of prolongation of life is not to be pressed historically as applying to every individual case, but is to be taken as indicating the tendency of keeping the Divine precepts, which, as a rule, ensure preservation of health, and hence "length of days." <span class="cmt_word">Long life</span> (<span class="accented">vush'noth khayyim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">years of life</span>; Targum Jonathan, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, <span class="accented">anni vitae</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The Authorized Version scarcely serves to bring out the sense of the original, as there is practically no difference in meaning between "length of days" and "long life? The idea conveyed in the expression, "years of life," is that of material prosperity. The thought of an extended life is carried on from the preceding expression, but it is amplified and described. The years of life will be many, but they will be years of life in its truest sense, as one of true happiness and enjoyment, free from distracting cares, sickness, and other drawbacks. The Hebrew plural, <span class="accented">khayyim</span>, "lives," is equivalent to the Greek expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "a life worth while living" (cf. Plat., 'Apol.,' 38, A). To the Israelitish mind, the happiness of life consisted in "dwelling in the land" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-30.htm">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>, etc.), and "abiding in the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a>) (Zockler). The conjecture that the plural, <span class="accented">khayyim</span>, signifies the present and the future  life, is unfounded. The scope of the promise before us is confined to the present stage of existence, and it is negatived also by the similar use of the plural in <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-5.htm">Proverbs 16:5</a>, "In the light of the king's countenance is life (<span class="accented">khayyim</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," where <span class="accented">khayyim</span> cannot possibly refer to the future life. <span class="accented">Khayyim</span> stands for life in its fulness. "Godliness" has indeed, as St. Paul wrote to Timothy, "promise of the life that now is, aud of that which is to come" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Peace</span> (<span class="accented">shalom</span>). The verb <span class="accented">shalam</span>, from which the substantive <span class="accented">shalom</span> is derived, signifies "to be whole, sound, safe," and hence "peace" means internal and external contentment, and tran-quillity of mind arising from the sense of safety. In ver. 17 the ways of Wisdom are designated <span class="accented">peace.</span> While, on the one hand, peace is represented by the psalmist as the possession of those who love God's Law (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>), on the other, it is denied the wicked (<a href="../../par/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall they add to thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall the precepts and commands bring (Zockler) or heap upon (Muffet) thee. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mercy and truth</span> (<span class="accented">khesed vermeth</span>); properly, <span class="accented">love and truth</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">misericordia et veritas</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. With this verse begin the commandments which are alluded to in ver. 1. The Hebrew <span class="accented">khesed</span> has to be understood in its widest sense, though the Vulgate and the LXX. confine it to one aspect of its meaning, viz. that which refers to the relation of man to man, to the pity evoked by the sight of another's misfortunes, and to ahnsgiving. The radical meaning of the word is "ardent desire," from the root <span class="accented">khasad</span>, "to eagerly or ardently desire." Delitzsch describes it as "well affectedness." Predicated of God, it indicates God's love and grace towards man; predicated of man, it signifies man's love toward s God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> piety, or man's love towards his neighbour, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> humanity. Where this mercy or love is exhibited in man it finds expression in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> mutual outward help; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> forgiveness of offences; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> sympathy of feeling, which leads to interchange of thought, and so to the development of the spiritual life (see Elster, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word carries with it the ideas of kindlim as, benignity (Targum, <span class="accented">benignitas</span>), and grace (Syriac, <span class="accented">gratia</span>)<span class="accented">. Truth</span> (<span class="accented">emeth</span>); properly, <span class="accented">firmness</span>, or <span class="accented">stability</span>, and so fidelity in which one performs one's promise. Truth is that absolute integrity of character, beth in word and deed, which secures the unhesitating confidence of all (Wardlaw). Umbreit and Elster designate it as inward truthfulness, the <span class="accented">pectus rectum</span>, the very essence of a true man. As <span class="accented">khesed</span> excludes all selfishness and hate, so <span class="accented">emeth</span> excludes all hypocrisy and dissimulation. These two virtues are frequently combined in the Proverbs (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>) and Psalms (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4-11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/108-5.htm">Psalm 108:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/138-2.htm">Psalm 138:2</a>), and, when predicated of man, indicate the highest normal standard of moral perfection (Zockler). The two ideas are again brought together in the New Testament phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>, "to speak the truth in love" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>). There seems little ground for the remark of Salasius, that "mercy" refers to our neighbours, and "truth" to God. Each virtue, in fact, has a twofold reference - one to God, the other to man. The promise in ver. 4, that the exercise of these virtues procures favour with God and man, implies this twofold aspect. Bind them about thy neck; either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as ornaments worn about the neck (Gejerus, Zockler); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as amulets or talismans, which were worn from a superstitious notion to ward off danger (Umbreit and Vaihinger); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as treasures which one wears attached to the neck by a chain to guard against their loss (Hitzig); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> as a signet, which was carried on a string round the neck (Delitzsch). The true reference of the passage seems to lie between (1) and (3). The latter adapts itself to the parallel expression, "Write them on the tablet of thine heart," and also agrees with <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-21.htm">Proverbs 6:21</a>, "Tie them about thy neck," the idea being that of their careful preservation against loss. The former meaning, however, seems preferable. Mercy and truth are to be ornaments of the character, to be bound round the neck, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worn at all times (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, "For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thine head, and chains about thy neck." See also <a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a>). The imagery of the binding is evidently taken from <a href="../../par/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, and is suggestive of the tephillim, or phylacteries. <span class="cmt_word">Write them upon the table of thine heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> inscribe them. mercy and truth, deeply there, impress them thoroughly and indelibly upon thine heart, so that they may never be forgotten, and may form the mainspring of your actions. The expression implies that the heart is to be in entire union with their dictates. <span class="accented">The table</span> (<span class="accented">luakh</span>) was the tablet expressly prepared for writing by being polished, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the writing table of <a href="../../par/luke/1-63.htm">Luke 1:63</a>, which, however, was probably covered with wax. The inscription was made with the <span class="accented">stylus.</span> The same word is used of the <span class="accented">tables</span> of stone, on which the ten commandments were written with the finger of God, end allusion is in all probability here made to that fact (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>). The expression, "the tables of the heart," occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>); and is used by AEschylus, 'Pro.,' 789, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the tablets of the heart." This clause is omitted in the LXX.

Delitzsch calls this "an admonitory imperative;" Bottcher, "the desponsive imperative." Compare the Greek construction in Menander, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "Know that this you will do." <span class="accented">Find</span> (<span class="accented">matza</span>); here simply "to attain," "obtain," not necessarily implying previous search, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Favour</span> (<span class="accented">khen</span>).

For the expression, "to find favour" (<span class="accented">matsa khen</span>), see <a href="../../par/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>."

So Delitzsch, Bertheau, Kamph. A true sagacity, prudence, or penetrating judgment will be adjudicated by God and man to him who possesses the internal excellence of love and truth. The Hebrew <span class="accented">sekel is</span> derived from <span class="accented">sakal</span>, "to act wisely or prudently," and has this intellectual meaning in <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> (see also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>). The Targum Jonathan reads, <span class="accented">intellectus et benignitas</span>, thus throwing the adjective into a substantival form; the Syriac, <span class="accented">intellectus</span> simply. Ewald, Hitzig, Zockler, and others, on the other hand, understand <span class="accented">sekel</span> as referring to the judgment formed of any one, the favourable opinion or view which is entertained of hint by others, and hence take it as <span class="accented">reputation</span>, or estimation. The man who has love and truth will be held in high esteem by God and man. Our objection to this rendering is that it does not seem to advance the meaning of the passage beyond that of "favour." Another, mentioned by Delitzsch, is that <span class="accented">sekel</span> is never used in any other sense than that of <span class="accented">intellectus</span> in the Mishle. The marginal reading, "good success," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prosperity, seems inadmissible here, as the hiph. <span class="accented">has'kil</span>, "to cause to prosper," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>, does not apply in this instance any more than in <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>, margin. <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of God and man</span> (<span class="accented">b'eyney elohim v'adam</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the eyes of Elohim and man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the judgment of God and man (Zockler); Vulgate<span class="accented">, coram Deo et hominibus.</span> A simpler form of this phrase is found in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>, where Samuel is said to have found favour with the Lord, and also with men. So in <a href="../../par/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a> Jesus found favour "with God and man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>, <a href="../../par/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>). The two conditions of favor and sagacity, or prudence, are not to be assigned respectively to God and man (as Ewald and Hitzig), or that finding favour has reference more to God, and being deemed prudent refers more to man. The statement is universal. Both these conditions will be adjudged to the man who has mercy and truth by God in heaven and man on earth at the same time (see Delitszch). The LXX., "after favour," instead of the text, reads, "and provide good things in the sight of the Lord and men," quoted by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Trust in the Lord</span> (<span class="accented">b'takh el y'hovah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">trust in Jehovah.</span> Entire reliance upon Jehovah, implied in the words, "with all thine heart," is here appropriately placed at the head of a series of admonitions which especially have God and man's relations with him in view, inasmuch as such confidence or trust, with its corresponding idea of the renunciation of reliance on self, is, as Zockler truly remarks, a "fundamental principle of all religion." It is the first lesson to be learnt by all, and no less necessary for the Jew than for the Christian. Without this reliance on or confidence in God, it is impossible to carry out any of the precepts of religion. <span class="accented">Batakh</span> is, properly, "to cling to," and so passes to the meaning of "to confide in," "to set one's hope and confidence upon." The preposition <span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> indicates the direction which the confidence is to take (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lean</span> (<span class="accented">tishshaen</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">innitaris</span>; followed by <span class="accented">el</span>, like <span class="accented">b'takh</span>, with which it is very similar in meaning. <span class="accented">Shaan</span>, not used in kal, in hiph. signifies "to lean upon, rest upon," just as man rests upon a spear for support. Its metaphorical use, <span class="accented">to repose confidence in</span>, is derived from the practice of kings who were accustomed to appear in public leaning on their friends and ministers; cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2, 17</a> (Gesenius). The admonition does not mean that we are not to <span class="accented">use</span> our own understanding (<span class="accented">binab</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> form plans with discretion, and employ legitimate means in the pursuit of our ends; but that, when we use it, we are to depend upon God and his directing and overruling providence (Wardlaw); cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</a>. "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom," etc. The teacher points out not only where  we are to rely, but also where we are not to rely.

The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">yada</span> signifies "to know, recognize." To acknowledge God is, therefore, to recognize, in all our dealings and undertakings, God's overruling providence, which "shapes our ends, rough hew them as we will." It is not a mere theoretical acknowledgment, but one that engages the whole energies of the soul (Delitzsch), and sees in God power, wisdom, providence, goodness, and justice. This meaning is conveyed by the Vulgate <span class="accented">cogitare</span>, which is "to consider" in all parts, "to reflect upon." David's advice to his son Solomon is, "Know thou (<span class="accented">ola</span>) the God of thy father." We may well acknowledge Jehovah; for he "knoweth the way of the righteous" (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). Acknowledging God also implies that we first ascertain whether what we are about to take in hand is in accordance with his precepts, and then look for his direction and illumination (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall direct thy paths</span> (<span class="accented">v'hu y'yashsher or'khotheyka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he himself shall make them straight, or level, removing all obstacles out of the way; or they shall, under God's direction, prosper and come to a successful issue; they shall be virtuous, inasmuch as deviation into vice will be guarded against, and happy, because they are prosperous. The pronoun <span class="accented">v'hu</span> is emphatic, "he himself;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">et ipse. Yashar</span>, piel. is "to make a way straight," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-21.htm">Proverbs 15:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>. Cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut straight" (see on Proverbs 11:5). God here binds himself by a covenant (Lapide). This power is properly attributed to God, for "it is not in man to direct his steps" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not wise in thine own eyes.</span> This admonition carries on the thought from the preceding verses (5, 6), approaching it from a different direction. It is a protest against self-sufficiency, self-conceit, and self-reliance. It says, in effect, "Trust in the Lord, do not trust in yourself." Wisdom, as Michaelis remarks, is to trust in God; to trust in yourself and in your own wisdom is unwisdom. God denounces this spirit: "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>), because such a spirit leads to the prohibited self-dependence, and is inconsistent with "the tear of the Lord." The precept of the text is reiterated by St. Paul, especially in <a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>, "Be not wise in your own conceits" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a>). It commends humility. The diligent search for Wisdom is commanded. The great hindrance to all true wisdom is the thought that we have already attained it (Plumptre). <span class="accented">In thine own eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in thine own estimation; <span class="accented">arbitrio tuo</span> (Trem. et Jun.). <span class="cmt_word">Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</span> The connection of this with the first part of the verse becomes clear upon reflection. "The fear of the Lord" is true wisdom (<a href="../../par/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Fear the Lord, therefore, because it is the best corrective of one's own wisdom, which engenders arrogance, pride, presumption of mind, which, moreover, is deceptive and apt to lead to sin. The fear of the Lord has this other advantage - that it leads to the departure from evil (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>) It is the mark of the wise man that he fears the Lord, and departs from evil (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>). These precepts form the two elements of practical piety (Delitzsch), an eminent example of which as Job (<a href="../../par/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</span> A metaphorical expression, denoting the complete spiritual health which shall follow from fearing the Lord and departing from evil. <span class="accented">Health</span>, (<span class="accented">riph'uth</span>); properly, <span class="accented">healing</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x1f05;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">sanitas</span>; so Syriac and Arabic. The Targum Jonathan has <span class="accented">medicina</span>, "medicine," as the margin. The root <span class="accented">rapha</span> is properly "to sew together," and the secondary meaning, "to heal," is taken from the healing of a wound by sewing it up. Delitzsch, however, thinks <span class="accented">riph'uth</span> is not to be taken as a restoration from sickness, but as a raising up from enfeebled health, or a confirming of the strength which already exists. There shall be a continuance of health. Gesenius translates "refreshment." <span class="accented">To thy navel</span> (<span class="accented">l'shor'rekha</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">umbilico tuo</span>; so Targum Jonathan. <span class="accented">Shor</span> is "the navel," here used synecdochically for the whole body, just as "head" is put for the whole man (<a href="../../par/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>), "mouth" for the whole person speaking (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>), and "slow bellies" for depraved gluttons (<a href="../../par/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>) (Gejerus, Umbreit). The idea is expressed in the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic by "to thy body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">corpori tuo</span>). The navel is here regarded as the centre of vital strength. For the word, see <a href="../../par/songs/7-2.htm">Song of Solomon 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>. This is the only place in the Proverbs where this word is found. Gesenius, however, takes <span class="accented">shor, or l'shor'rekha</span>, as standing col. lectively for the nerves, in which, he says, is the seat of strength, and translates accordingly, "Health (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> refreshment) shall it be to thy nerves." <span class="accented">Marrow</span> (<span class="accented">shik'kuy</span>); literally, <span class="accented">watering</span> or <span class="accented">moistening</span>, as in the margin; Vulgate, <span class="accented">irrigatio.</span> Moistening is imparted to the bones by the marrow, and  thus they are strengthened: "His bones are moistened with marrow" (<a href="../../par/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a>). Where there is an absence of marrow the drying up of the bones ensues, and hence their strength is impaired, and a general debility of the system sets in - they "wax old" (<a href="../../par/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>). The effect of a broken spirit is thus described: "A broken spirit drieth up the bones" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). The physiological fact here brought forward is borne witness to by Cicero, 'In Tusc.:' "In visceribus atque medullis omne bonum condidisse naturam" (cf. Plato). The meaning of the passage is that, as health to the navel and marrow to the bones stand as representatives of physical strength, so the fear of the Lord, etc., is the spiritual strength of God's children.

The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> by the LXX. limits the wealth to that which is justly acquired, and so guards against the erroneous idea that God is honoured by the appropriation to his use of unlawful wealth or gain (Plumptre). The Israelites "honoured Jehovah with their substance" when they contributed towards the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and later when they assisted in the preparations for the building of the temple, and in the payment of tithes. The injunction may undoubtedly refer to tithes, and is in accordance with the requirement of the Mosaic Law on that and other points as to oblations, free will offerings, etc.; but it has a wider bearing and contemplates the use of wealth for all pious and charitable purposes (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>). The word <span class="accented">maaser</span>, "tithe," does not occur in the Proverbs. <span class="cmt_word">With the firstfruits</span> (<span class="accented">mere-shith</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">de primitiis.</span> So Targum Jonathan, Syriac, and Arabic.

The firstfruits were presented by every Israelite to the priests, in token of gratitude and humble thankfulness to Jehovah, and consisted of the produce of the land in its natural state, or prepared for human food (Maclear, 'Old Test. Hist.,' bk. 4, c. 3, <span class="accented">a</span>). The "firstfruits" also carried with it the idea of the best. The custom of offering the firstfruits of the field and other revenues as a religious obligation was observed by ancient pagan nations (see Diod. Sic., 1:14; Plut., 'De Iside,' p. 377; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 18:2 (Zockler). Some of the ancient commentators find in this verse an argument for the support of the ministry. It is well known that the priests "lived of the sacrifice," and were "partakers of the altar," and as their support by these means tended to the maintenance of Divine worship, so those who supported them were in the highest degree "honoring God." The injunctions also show that the honouring of God does not consist simply of lip service, of humility and confidence in him, but also of external worship, and in corporeal things. They are not peculiar to Israel, but are binding on all. They oppose all <span class="accented">selfish</span> use of God's temporal gifts, and lead to the thought that, in obeying them, we are only giving back to God what are his own.

The thought of prosperity suggests the opposite one of adversity. Abundant prosperity shall flow from honouring Jehovah, but he sometimes and not unfrequently sends affliction, and, indeed, without this life would be incomplete. The object of the exhortation is, as Delitzsch states, to show that, as in prosperity God should not be forgotten, so one should not suffer himself to be estranged by days of adversity. Submission is counselled on the ground that, when Jehovah afflicts, he does so in the spirit of love, and for good. The "chastening" and "correction," though presenting God in an attitude of anger, are in reality not the punishment of an irate God. The verse before us is evidently copied from <a href="../../par/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, "Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth, therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty;" and the whole passage is cited again in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5, 6</a>). It has been said that ver. 11 expresses the problem of the Book of Job, and ver. 12 its solution (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Despise not</span> (<span class="accented">al-timas</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne abjicias</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The verb mass is first "to reject," and then "to despise and contemn." The Targum Jonathan puts the thought in a stronger form, <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">execreris</span>, "do not curse." They despise the chastening of Jehovah who, when they see his hand in it, do not humbly and submissively bow, but resist and become refractory, or, as it is expressed in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>, when their "heart fretteth against the Lord." Job, notwithstanding his bitter complaints, was on the whole, and in his better moments, an example of the proper state of mind under correction (see <a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>). Jonah, in treating contemptuously the procedure of God, is an exemplification of the contrary spirit, which is condemned implicitly in the text (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">Chastening</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>); i.e. correction not by reproof only, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a> and Proverbs 8:30; but by punishment also. as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>. The meaning here is expressed by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is "instruction by punishment," discipline, or schooling (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">disciplina</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Neither be weary</span> (<span class="accented">al-takots</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not loathe, abhor, feel disgust nor vexation towards. The expression, "do not loathe," is a climax to the other, "despise not." It represents a more deeply seated aversion to Jehovah's plans. Gesenius takes the primary meaning of <span class="accented">kuts</span> to be that of vomiting. The word before us certainly denotes loathing or nausea, and is used in this sense by the Israelites in their complaints against God and against Moses in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a>). The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in quoting the passage, adopts the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "nor faint;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne deficias, i.e.</span> "do not give way to despondency." <span class="cmt_word">Correction</span>. This word, like <span class="accented">musar</span> above, has a twofold meaning of either punishment or chastening, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/73-14.htm">Psalm 73:14</a>; or reproof, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>; 25:30; 5:12; 27:5; 29:15, where it also occurs. It is here used in the former sense. To loathe the correction of Jehovah is to allow it to completely estrange us from him. We faint under it when, by dwelling on or brooding over, or bemoaning the trial, the spirit sinks to faintness. To faint at correction ignores the belief in the truth that "all things work together for good to them that love God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - In this verse the motive for submissiveness to Jehovah's corrections is brought forward. They are corrections, but they are the corrections of love. One of the most touching relationships of life, and that with which we are most familiar, viz. that of father and son, is employed to reconcile us to Jehovah's afflictive dispensations. A comparison is drawn. God corrects those whom he loves after the same manner as a father corrects ("correcteth" has to be understood from the first hemistich) the  son whom he loves. The idea of the passage is evidently taken from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>, "Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee." The idea of the paternal relationship of God to mankind is found elsewhere (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>), and especially finds expression in the Lord's prayer. When the truth of this passage is learned, we shall be drawn to, rather than repelled from, God by his corrections. The gracious end of earthly trials is expressed in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6, 2</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a> (Wardlaw). "These gracious words (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>.) are written in Holy Scripture for our comfort and instruction; that we should patiently and with thanksgiving bear our heavenly Father's correction, whensoever by any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit us" (see Visitation Office). <span class="cmt_word">Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av eth-ben yir'tseh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">even as a father the son be delighteth in.</span> Various renderings have been given to this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Delitzsch, De Wette, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, agree with the Authorized Version, and take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">vav, as</span> explicative, and <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," as a relative sentence. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> is used in this explanatory sense in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a> (see Gesenius, &sect; 155, 1 <span class="accented">a</span>). The relative <span class="accented">usher</span>, "whom," is omitted in the original, according to the rule that the relative is omitted, especially in poetry, where it would stand as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative case (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>, "And he falls into the pit (which) he made;" and <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-13.htm">Proverbs 5:13</a>). We have the same elision of the relative in the English colloquial expression, "the friend I met" (see Gesenius, &sect; 123:3, <span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig and Zockler translate, "and holds him dear as a father his son." This, though grammatically correct, does not preserve the parallelism. It serves only to expand the idea of love, whereas the predominant idea of the verse is that of correction, to which love is an accessory idea (see Delitzsch). For similar parallels, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a> as before, and <a href="../../par/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>. In the comparison which is instituted, <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," corresponds with <span class="accented">eth asher ye'hav y'hovah</span>, "whom the Lord loveth," and not with <span class="accented">yokiah</span>, "correcteth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kamph translates, "and (dealeth) as a father (who) wisheth well to his son." This is substantially the same as the Authorized Version, except that in the relative sentence "son" is made accusative after <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, here translated, "wisheth well to," and the emitted relative (<span class="accented">asher</span>) is placed in the nominative instead of the accusative case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The variation in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "and scourgeth every son whom he rcceiveth," cited literally in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>, evidently arises from the translators having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, (<span class="accented">yakev</span>), "he scourgeth" for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av</span>), "even as a father." It will be seen that this alteration could be easily effected by a change in the Masoretic pointing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">et quasi pater in filio complacet sibi.

In doing so, he reverts to his main subject, which is Wisdom, or the fear of the Lord (see ver. 7 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>), and pronounces a panegyric upon her, comparing her, as in <a href="../../par/job/28.htm">Job 28</a>, with treasures whose value she exceeds, and showing wherein that value consists, viz. in the gifts which she confers on man. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Happy is the man</span> (<span class="accented">ash'rey adam</span>); literally, <span class="accented">blessings of the man.</span> The plural of "excellence" used here, as in <a href="../../par/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, to raise the sense. The man who has found Wisdom is supremely blessed. Beds connects this blessedness immediately with God's chastisements in the preceding verse. So Delitzsch. <span class="cmt_word">That findeth</span> (<span class="accented">matsa</span>); properly, <span class="accented">hath found.</span> "The perfect expresses permanent possession, just as the imperfect, <span class="accented">yaphik</span>, denotes a continually renewed and repeated attaining" (Zockler). The Vulgate also uses the perfect, <span class="accented">invenit</span>, "hath found;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>, "who found" - the aorist. <span class="cmt_word">The man that getteth understanding</span> (<span class="accented">adam yaphik t'vunah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the man that draweth out understanding</span>, as in the margin. <span class="accented">Yaphik</span> is the hiph. future or imperfect of <span class="accented">puk</span>, the primary meaning of which is <span class="accented">educere</span>, "to draw out," "to bring forth." This verb is used in two widely different senses. In the first place, it is equivalent to "bring forth" or "draw out" in the sense of <span class="accented">imparting</span>, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>, "If thou <span class="accented">draw out</span> thy soul to the hungry," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> impart benefits to them; and <a href="../../par/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>, "That our garners may be full, <span class="accented">affording</span> all manner of store," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> yielding, giving out, presenting for our benefit. Its second sense is that of attaining, drawing out from another for one's own use. In this sense it occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>, where it is rendered "obtain." The latter sense is the one that suits the present passage, and best agrees with the corresponding <span class="accented">matsa.</span> The man is blessed who draws forth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> obtains, understanding from God for himself. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">qui affluit prudentia</span>, "who overflows with understanding," or, has understanding in abundance; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, equivalent to "who saw." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The merchandise</span> (<span class="accented">sakh'rah</span>);  Vulgate, <span class="accented">acquisitio</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The gain arising from trading in wisdom is better than that which arises from trading in silver. <span class="accented">Sakh'rah</span> is the gain or profit arising from merchandise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from trading. It denotes the act itself of gaining. The root <span class="accented">sakrah</span>, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, signifies "to go about for the sake of traffic," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to trade.

The word is used of the produce of the earth, the idea apparently embodied in the Vulgate <span class="accented">fructus.</span> In this case there may be a reference to ver. 18, where Wisdom is said to be a "tree of life." The LXX. omits the latter clause of this verse. The sense is, "The possession of Wisdom herself is better than fine gold." <span class="cmt_word">Fine gold</span> (<span class="accented">karuts</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">aurum purum</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">aurum purissimum. Kharuts</span> is the poetic word for gold, so called, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from its brilliancy, and then akin to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Curtius); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from its being dug up, from the root <span class="accented">kharats</span>, "to cut into or dig up, to sharpen." It evidently means the finest and purest gold, and is here contrasted with silver (<span class="accented">keseph</span>). The word is translated "choice gold" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; "gold" simply in <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; "yellow gold" in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a>; and "fine gold" in <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>. In the Version Junii et Tremellii it appears as <span class="accented">effosum aurum</span>, "gold dug up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> gold in its native, unalloyed state. The Targum Jonathan understands it of "molten gold" (<span class="accented">aurum conflatum</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rubies</span> (Khetib, <span class="accented">p'niyim</span>; Keri, <span class="accented">p'ninim</span>). No unanimous opinion has been arrived at as to the real signification of the word here translated "rubies." The majority of the rabbins (among them Rashi), and Bochart, Hartman, Bohlen, Lee on <a href="../../par/job/38-18.htm">Job 38:18</a>, and Zockler, render it "pearls." Its meaning seems to lie between this and "corals," the rendering adopted by Michaelis, Gesenius, and Delitzsch (following Fleischer), who says that the Hebrew <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> corresponds with the Arabia word whose root idea is "shooting forth," and means "a branch." The peculiar branching form in which corm is found favours this opinion, which is strengthened by the passage in <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, where we get additional information as to color, "They [the Nazarites] were more ruddy in body than rubies," a description of which would apply to "coral," but is scarcely applicable to "pearls." The various versions suggest the further idea that <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> was a descriptive word used to denote precious stones in general. The LXX. renders, "She is more precious than precious stones (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." So the Targum Jonathan, Syriac, and Arabic. The Vulgate renders. "She is more precious than all riches (<span class="accented">cunctis opibus</span>)." The word <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> only occurs here (Keri) and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-15.htm">Proverbs 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>; and in Job and Lamentations as above. This passage, as well as <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>, which is an almost literal repetition of it, are imitations of <a href="../../par/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>. The identification of <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> with "pearls" may have suggested our Lord's parable of the pearl of great price (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45, 46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the things thou canst desire</span> (<span class="accented">kal-khaphatseyka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">all thy desires.</span> Here everything in which you have pleasure, or all your precious things; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">omnia, quae desiderantur.</span> The comparison, which has risen from the less to the more valuable, culminates in this comprehensive expression. There is nothing, neither silver, gold, precious stones, nor anything precious, which is an equivalent (<span class="accented">shavah</span>) to Wisdom in value. How it shows, when everything is put before us to choose from, that, like Solomon at Gibeon, we should prefer wisdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-11.htm">1 Kings 3:11-13</a>)! In the second half of this verse the LXX. substitutes, "No evil thing competes with her; she is well known to all that approach her." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The remaining three verses (16-18) state in what respects Wisdom is incomparable in value. <span class="cmt_word">Length of days</span>; <span class="accented">orek yamim</span>, as in ver. 2. Wisdom is here represented as holding in her right hand that which is previously promised to obedience. Length of days is the blessing of blessings, the condition of all prosperity and enjoyment, and hence is placed in the right hand, the chief place, for among the Hebrews and other Oriental nations, as also among the Greeks the right hand was regarded as the position of highest honour (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; 1 Macc. 10:63; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24</a>); cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>. in which the psalmist says of Jehovah, "In thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore." The two hands, the right and the left, signify the abundance of Wisdom's gifts. <span class="cmt_word">Riches and honour</span> stand here for prosperity in general. The same expression occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-8.htm">Proverbs 8:8</a>, where riches are explained as "durable riches." A spiritual interpretation can, of course, be given to this passage - length of days being understood of eternal life; riches, of heavenly riches; and honour, not "the honour that cometh of men," but honour conferred by God (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>:44; <a href="../../par/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>); see Wardlaw, <span class="accented">in loc.</span> The thought of the verse is, of course, that Wisdom not only holds these blessings in her hands, but also confers them on those who  seek her. The LXX. adds, "Out of her month proceedeth righteousness; justice and mercy she beareth upon her tongue;" possibly suggested by <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>. The words of the teacher remind us of the saying of Menander, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "He who excels in prudence possesses all things."

Wisdom's ways are those in which substantial delight may be found. They are beautiful and lovely to look upon, and afford happiness. All her paths are peace (<span class="accented">v'kal-n'thivo-theyah shalom</span>); literally, as in the Authorized Version. "Peace," <span class="accented">shalom</span>, is not genitive as "pleasantness." The character of peace is stamped upon her paths, so that in speaking of Wisdom's paths we speak of peace. She brings tranquillity and serenity and blessedness. Her paths are free from strife and alarm, and they lead to peace. (On the distinction between "ways" and "paths" - the more open and the more private walks - see <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>.)

This expression obviously refers to "the tree of life" (<span class="accented">ets-hakayyim</span>), which was placed in the midst of the garden of Eden, and conferred immortality on those who ate of its fruit (Genisis 2:9; 3:22). So Wisdom becomes equally life giving to those who lay hold on her, who taste of her fruit. She communicates life in its manifold fulness and richness (so the plural "lives" indicates) to those who seize her firmly. What is predicated of Wisdom here is predicated in other passages (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a>) of the fruit of the righteous, the fulfilment of desire, and a wholesome tongue. Each of these, the teacher says, is "a tree of life." Elster denies that there is any reference to "the tree of life," and classes the expression among those other figurative expressions - a "fountain of life," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a> and Proverbs 14:27, and a "well of life." in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>; but if it be once admitted that there is such a reference, and it be remembered also that Wisdom is the same as "the fear of the Lord," the point insisted on in the Proverbs and in Job, it seems difficult to deny that the teacher has in view the blessed immortality of which the tree of life in Paradise as the symbol. In this higher sense the term is used in the Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2, 14</a>). Wisdom restores to her worshippers the life which was lost in Adam (Cartwright). It is remarkable that the imagery here employed is confined to these two hooks. After the historical record in Genesis, no other sacred writers refer to the tree of life. Old ecclesiastical writers saw in the expression a reference to Christ's redeeming work. "The tree of life is the cross of Christ," <span class="accented">lignum vitae crux Christi</span> (quoted by Delitzsch). The symbol, Plumptre remarks, entered largely into the religious imagery of Assyria, Egypt, and Persia. <span class="cmt_word">To them that lay hold upon</span> (<span class="accented">lam-makhazikim</span>, hiph. participle); Vulgate, <span class="accented">his, qui apprehenderint</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">khazak</span>), "to tie fast," is in hiph. with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," to take hold of," "to seize any one." Happy is every one that retaineth her. In the original, the participle, "they retaining her" (<span class="accented">tom'keyah</span>), is plural, and the predicate, "happy" or "blessed" (<span class="accented">m'ushshar</span>), is singular. The latter is used distributively, and the construction is common (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>). The Authorized Version aptly renders the original. The necessity for "retaining" as well as "laying hold" of Wisdom is pointed out. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tamak</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> "to hold fast something taken." Such will be blessed who hold Wisdom tenaciously and perseveringly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-26.</span> - 5. <span class="accented">Fifth hortatory discourse. Wisdom, the creative power of God, exhibited as the protection of those who fear God</span>. The teacher in this discourse presents Wisdom under a new aspect. Wisdom is the Divine power of God, by which he created the world, and by which he sustains the work of his hands and regulates the operations of nature. This eminence of Wisdom, in her intimate association with Jehovah, is made the basis of a renewed exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily in view. The elevated thought that Wisdom has her source in Jehovah might seem in itself an adequate and sufficient reason for the exhortation. But another motive is adduced intimately bound up with this view of Wisdom. Jehovah becomes the ground of confidence and the protection in all conditions of life of those who keep Wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth.</span> The emphatic position of the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, "the Lord," at the beginning of the sentence (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/97.htm">Psalm 97</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99</a>), as well as the nature of the discourse, indicates a new paragraph. The description of the creative Wisdom of Jehovah may have been suggested to the mind of the teacher by the mention of the tree of life, in ver. 18 (Zockler); but the connection between this and the preceding passage has to be sought for in something deeper. The scope of the teacher is to exhibit, and so to recommend, Wisdom in every respect, and after showing her excellence in man, he now  brings her forward as the medium of creation, and hence in her relation to God. <span class="accented">By wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">sapientia</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. It is evident that Wisdom is here something more than an attribute of Jehovah. "By Wisdom" means "by, or through, the instrumentality of Wisdom." While the corresponding and parallel expressions, "understanding," "knowledge," militate against the idea of an hypostatizing of Wisdom, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> assigning to Wisdom a concrete and objective personality, yet the language is sufficiently strong, when we connect this passage with ch. 1. and 8, to warrant our regarding Wisdom as something apart from yet intimately connected with Jehovah, as an active agency employed by him, and hence this description may. be looked upon as an anticipation of that which is more fully developed in ch. 8, where the characteristics which are wanting here are there worked out at length. The rabbins evidently connected the passage before us, as well as ch. 1 and 8, with <a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, by rendering <span class="accented">b'reshith</span>, "in the beginning." by <span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>, "by Wisdom." Our Lord identifies himself with the Divine Sophia, or Wisdom (<a href="../../par/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>). And the language of St. John, "All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made" (<a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>), which assigns to the Logos, or Word of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the act of creation (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>, and especially the language of St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>), argues in favour of the view of some commentators who understand Wisdom to refer to the Second Person of the Trinity. The Logos was understood by Alexandrian Judaism to express the <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of the unseen God, the Absolute Being, in the creation and government of the world; and the Christian teachers, when they adopted this term, assigned to it a concrete meaning as indicating the Incarnate Word (see Bishop Lightfoot, in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). For the passage, see <a href="../../par/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5</a>; and especially <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>, "He hath established the world by his wisdom," etc.; Jeremiah 51:55; Ecclus. 24:2, <span class="accented">seq.

While the primary meaning of <span class="accented">yasad</span> is "to give fixity to," "to lay fast," that of <span class="accented">konen</span>, rendered "he hath established," is "to set up," "to erect," and so "to <span class="accented">found</span>," from <span class="accented">kun</span>, or referring to the Arabic and Ethiopic cognate root, "to exist," "to give existence to." The marginal reading, "prepared," corresponds with the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The Vulgate is <span class="accented">stabilivit</span>, "he hath established."

So Munster, Zockler, Wardlaw. But it seems better to understand it (as Mercerus, Lapide, Delitzsch, and Authorized Version) of the fertilization of the earth by rivers, streams, etc., which burst forth from the interior of the earth. In this sense the correspondence is preserved with the second hemistich. where the atmospheric influence is referred to as conducing to the same end. The teacher passes from the creation to the wonderful means which Jehovah employs through Wisdom to sustain his work. <span class="accented">The depths</span> (<span class="accented">t'homoth</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">abyssi</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, are here "the internal water stores of the earth" (Delitzsch), and not the depths of the ocean, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24, 27, 28</a>, and in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. <span class="accented">Are broken up</span> (<span class="accented">niv'kau</span>); properly, <span class="accented">were broken up</span>, niph. perfect of <span class="accented">baka</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to cleave asunder, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to break forth, as water, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The perfect describes a past act, but one that is still continuing in effect.

There seems to be no allusion here either to the Deluge (Beds), nor to the cleaving of the waters of the Red Sea (Gejerus), though both of these historical events were undoubtedly well known to the teacher. And the clouds drop down the dew. <span class="accented">The clouds</span> (<span class="accented">sh'khakim</span>) are properly the <span class="accented">ether</span>, the higher and colder regions of the atmosphere, and then "the clouds," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>, which are formed by the condensation of vapours drawn by solar influence from the surface of the earth - seas, rivers, etc. The singular <span class="accented">shakhak</span> signifies "dust," and. secondly "a cloud," evidently from the minute particles of moisture of which a cloud is composed. <span class="accented">Drop down</span> (<span class="accented">yir'aphu</span>, kal future of <span class="accented">raaph</span>, used as a present or imperfect); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "let flow." The clouds discharge their contents in showers, or distil at evening in refreshing dew. Modern science agrees with the meteorological fact here alluded to, of the reciprocal action of the heavens and the earth. The moisture drawn from the earth returns again "to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud, to give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>). <span class="accented">Dew</span>; <span class="accented">tal</span>, here used not only of dew, but of rain in gentle and fructifying showers. The Arabic word signifies "light rain;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "dew." Moses, in describing the blessing of Israel, says, "His heavens shall drop down dew" in the same sense (Deuteronomy 38:28; cf. <a href="../../par/job/36-28.htm">Job 36:28</a>). The fertilization of the earth is ordered by the Divine Wisdom.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes.</span> After the description of the power of Wisdom exhibited in creating and sustaining the earth, the exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily before the eyes, and the promises of Divine protection, appropriately follow.

The LXX. renders absolutely <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "do not thou pass by," from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, "to flow by," "to pass by, recede" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>, "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to these things, lest at any time we should let them slip (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)," quoted probably from the LXX. of this passage). The Targum Jonathan reads <span class="accented">ne vilescat</span>, "let it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom, "not become worthless." <span class="accented">Them</span>, included in the verb <span class="accented">yaluzu</span> of which it is subject in the original, is to be referred either to "sound wisdom and discretion" of ver. 21b - so Gejerus, Cartwright, Geier, Umbreit, Hitzig, Zockter, Plumptre (a similar trajection occurs in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, and is used, as here, to give vividness to the description): or to "wisdom, understanding, knowledge," of the preceding verses - so Delitzsch and Holden. The first view in every way seems preferable, and it is no objection to it that "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>) and "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'yimmah</span>) are feminine, while the verb "depart" (<span class="accented">yaluzu</span>) is masculine (see Gesenius, *Gram.,' &sect; 147). The Syriac reads, "Let it not become worthless (<span class="accented">ne vile fit</span>) in thine eyes to keep my doctrine and my counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Keep sound wisdom and discretion.</span> <span class="accented">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">n'zor</span>, kal imperative of <span class="accented">natsar</span>, "to watch, guard." For "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>), see <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>. Here used for "wisdom" (<span class="accented">kokhmah</span>), as "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'zimmah</span>) for "understanding" (<span class="accented">t'vunah</span>), to contrast the absolute wisdom and insight of God with the corresponding attributes in man (see Zockler, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). They belong to God, but are conferred on those who seek after Wisdom, and are then to be guarded as priceless treasures. The Vulgate reads, <span class="accented">custodi legem et consilium</span>; and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">g</span>uard my counsel and thought."

The latter expression is very similar to <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, where the same promise is expressed, "grace" (<span class="accented">hon</span>) being equivalent to "ornament of grace" (<span class="accented">liv'yath hon</span>).

Iu the desolation which shall overwhelm the wicked he who has made Wisdom his guide shall be undismayed, for the Lord is his confidence.

Jehovah shall be in the highest sense your ground and object of confidence. Delitzsch describes <span class="accented">kesel</span> as confidence in the presence of evil: Jehovah in the presence of the "sudden fear," and of "the desolation of the wicked," the evils and calamities which overwhelm the wicked, shall be thy confidence. The sense of his all-encircling protection will render you undismayed. The meaning given to <span class="accented">kesel</span> as "foolhardiness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>) and "folly" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>). and the connection of <span class="accented">kesel</span> with <span class="accented">k'silim</span> in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>, comes from the root idea <span class="accented">kasal</span>, "to be fleshly, or fat," the signification of which branches out on the one side into strength and boldness, and on the other into languor and inertness, and so folly or confidence in self (Schultens, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>). The Talmudic rendering of the Rabbi Salomon approximates to this meaning, "and the things in which you seemed to be foolish (<span class="accented">desipere videbaris</span>) he will be at once present with you." Others, as Ziegler, Muentinghe, gave <span class="accented">kesel</span> its primary meaning, and translate, "Jehovah shall be as thy loins," the loins being regarded as the emblem of strength. Jehovah shall be your strength. But <span class="accented">kesel</span> does not appear to have this local application here. Wherever it is used in this sense, as in Job and Leviticus cited above, there is something in the context to point it out as a part of the body. Compare, however, the Vulgate. <span class="accented">in latere suo</span>, "in thy side or flank." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "over all thy ways." From being taken (<span class="accented">millaked</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne capiaris</span>, "lest thou be taken." The meaning is, Jehovah will be your protection against all the snares and traps which the impious lay for you. <span class="accented">Leked</span>, "a being taken," is from <span class="accented">lakad</span>, "to take or catch animals" in a net or in snares. It only occurs here in the Proverbs. Its unusual appearance, together with other reasons, not tenable, however, has led Hitzig to reject vers. 22-26 as an interpolation.  The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, pavorem. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, is used subjectively, and means "any vehement emotion."

Authorized Version, "and be not afraid with any amazement;" see also Book of Common Prayer: 'Solemnization of Matrimony,' <span class="accented">ad fin</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a></div><div class="verse">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-35.</span> - 6. <span class="accented">Sixth admonitory discourse.</span> In this discourse the teacher still carries on his object, which is to demonstrate the conditions upon which true wisdom and happiness are to be attained. The discourse differs from the preceding in consisting of detached proverbs, and may be divided into two main sections - the first (vers. 27-30) enjoining benevolence, that love to one's neighbour which is the fulfilling of the Law; the second warning against emulating the oppressor and associating with him, because of the fate of the wicked (vers. 31-35). It is observable that all the maxims have a negative form, and thus present a striking contrast to the form adopted by our Lord in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>.), and to the admonitions at the close of St. Paul's Epistles. In one instance in particular (ver. 30), the teaching does not reach the high moral standard of the gospel (see Delitzsch and Lange). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due.</span> This precept indicates the general principle of beneficence, and not merely, as the words at first sight seem to imply, restitution (as Cajet.). We are to do good to those who are in need or deserving of it, whenever we have the means and opportunity. <span class="accented">From them to whom it is due</span> (<span class="accented">nib'alayv</span>); literally, <span class="accented">from its owner</span>, from <span class="accented">baal, dominus</span>, "lord" or owner of a thing. Cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-22.htm">Proverbs 16:22</a>, "Prudence is a fountain of life to its owner (<span class="accented">b'alayv</span>);" 1:19; 17:8; and also <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; - in all of which passages proprietorship in the thing or quality mentioned is expressed. The owners of good are those to whom good is due or belongs either by law or by morality, whether by desert or need. The latter qualification is the one emphasized in the LXX, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fc6;</span>, "Abstain not from doing good to the needy." So the Arabic <span class="accented">pauperi.</span> The Targum and Syriac put the precept in more general terms, "Cease not to do good," without indicating in particular anyone who is to be the recipient of the good. But the Jewish interpreters generally (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ben Ezra) understand it of the poor, <span class="accented">egentibus.</span> The Vulgate puts an entirely different interpretation on the passage: <span class="accented">Noli prohibere benefacere eum qui potest</span>; <span class="accented">si vales, et ipse benefac</span>, "Do not prohibit him who can from doing good; if you are able, do good also yourself." It thus implies that we are to put no impediment in the way of any one who is willing to do good to others, and enjoins the duty on ourselves also. <span class="accented">Good</span> (<span class="accented">tov</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">good"</span> under any form, any good deed or act of beneficence. The principle brought forward in this passage is that what we possess and is seemingly our own is in reality to be regarded as belonging to others. We are only stewards of our wealth. <span class="cmt_word">In the power of thine hand</span> (<span class="accented">lel yad'yka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the power of thine hands.</span> For the dual, <span class="accented">yad'yka</span>, the Keri substitutes the singular, <span class="accented">yad'ka</span>, to harmonize it with the similar expression, <span class="accented">lel yadi</span>, "in the power of thy hand," which occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-32.htm">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>. But there is no grammatical need for the emendation. Both the LXX. and Targum employ the singular, "thy hand." <span class="accented">Power</span> (<span class="accented">el</span>); here "strength" in the abstract. Usually it means "the strong," and is so used as an appellation of Jehovah. though, as Gesenius says, those little understand the phrase who would render <span class="accented">el</span> here "by God." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to <span class="accented">el</span> indicates the condition. The meaning of the phrase is, "While it is practicable, and you have the opportunity and means of doing good, do it." Do not defer, but do good promptly. The passage receives a remarkable illustration in the language of St. Paul, "While we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men" (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a></div><div class="verse">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - The precept of this and that of the preceding verse are very closely related. The former precept enjoined the general principle of benevolence when we have the means; this carries on the idea, and is directed against the postponement of giving when we are in a position to give. In effect it says, "Do not defer till tomorrow what you can do today." This "putting off" may arise from avarice, from indolence, or from insolence and contempt. These underlying faults, which are incompatible with neighbourly good wilt, are condenmed by implication. <span class="cmt_word">Unto thy neighbour;</span> <span class="accented">l'reayka</span>, "to thy friends," the word being evidently used distributively. <span class="accented">Reeh</span> is "a companion" or "friend" (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">amico tuo</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">sodali tuo</span>), and generally any other person, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "neighbour." The Authorized Version correctly renders "come again," as <span class="accented">shav</span> is not merely  "to return," but to return again to something (so Delitzsch); cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">revertere</span>; and as the words, "tomorrow I will give thee," show. The LXX. adds, "For thou knowest not what the morrow may bring forth," probably from <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>. If viewed in respect of the specific claims which servants have for work done, the precept is a re-echo of Leviticus 29:13 and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>. In illustration of the general scope of the passage, Grotius quotes, "A slow-footed favour is a favour without favour." Seneca says in the same spirit, "Ingratum est beneficium quod diu inter manus dantis haesit," "The benefit is thankless which sticks long between the hands of the giver" (Seneca, 'Benef.,' 1:2); cf. also <span class="accented">Bis dat qui cito dat.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a></div><div class="verse">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Devise not evil against thy neighbour.</span> This precept is directed against abuse of confidence. <span class="accented">Devise not evil</span> (<span class="accented">al takharosh raah</span>). The meaning of this expression lies between "fabricating evil" and "ploughing evil." The radical meaning of <span class="accented">kharash</span>, from which <span class="accented">takharosh</span>, is "to cut into," "to inscribe" letters on a tablet, cognate with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut into." But it is used in the sense of "to plough" in <a href="../../par/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>, "They that plough iniquity (<span class="accented">khar'shey aven</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," and <a href="../../par/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, "The ploughers ploughed (<span class="accented">khar'shim khar'shim</span>) upon my back" (cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>). This also appears from the context to be the meaning in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>. With these we may compare such expressions as "to plough a lie" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered in the Authorized Version, "Devise not a lie"); see <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>, and "to sow iniquity," <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a> - a cognate figure. "To plough evil" is to devise evil, to prepare for it, just in the same way as a ploughman prepares the land for sowing. In this sense the verb is understood by the older commentators and by Ewald and Delitzsch. On the other hand, the verb may be used in its other signification, "to fabricate," and hence "to contrive." The noun <span class="accented">kharash</span> is an artificer of iron, etc. (<a href="../../par/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>). "To fabricate evil" is, of course, as the Authorized Version "to devise evil." The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc4;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to build," inclines to this sense. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne moliaris</span>, does not clear up the point, though <span class="accented">moliri</span>, usually "to contrive," is used by Virgil, 'Georg.,' 1:494, "moliri terrain," of working or tilling the ground. The verb also occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-20.htm">Proverbs 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cure ille in te habet fiduciam</span>, "when he has confidence in thee;" so the LXX.; or, as the Targum and Syriac, "when he dwells with thee in peace." <span class="accented">To dwell</span> (<span class="accented">yashar</span>) is in <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> "to sit with any one," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to associate familiarly with him (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4, 5</a>); but it also has the meaning , "to dwell," and the participle <span class="accented">yoshev</span>, here used; in <a href="../../par/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>: <a href="../../par/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>, means "an inhabitant, a dweller." <span class="accented">Securely</span> (<span class="accented">lavetah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with full trust (see on ver. 23). Devising evil against a friend is at any time reprehensible, but to do so when he confides in and is altogether unsuspicious of you, is an act of the greatest treachery, and an outrage on all law. human and Divine. It implies dissimulation. It is the very sin by which "the devil beguiled Eve through his subtlety" (Wardlaw).

Holdea renders, "Surely he will return thee evil," in the sense that unprovoked attack ensures retaliation.]gut this is to ignore the negative force of <span class="accented">im-lo</span>, "if not." The verb sometimes means "requiting," but not in the passage before us, nor in <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-12.htm">Proverbs 31:12</a>. The Vulgate renders as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Cum ipse tibi nihil mali fecerit.</span> It is to be remarked that this precept falls below the moral standard of the New Testament teaching (see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-41</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-6.htm">1 Corinthians 6:6-8</a>), and of the example of our Lord, of whom it was predicted that "When he was reviled, be reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>).

Success and wealth may follow from severity and extortion, but the man who acquires prosperity by these means is not to be envied even by the victim of his oppression (for the verb, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-17.htm">Proverbs 23:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1, 19</a>). <span class="accented">The oppressor</span> (<span class="accented">ish khamas</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a man of violence</span> (see margin). The expression occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-41.htm">Psalm 18:41</a>, and in its plural form, <span class="accented">ish khamamim</span>, "man of violences," in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-49.htm">2 Samuel 22:49</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/140-1.htm">Psalm 140:1, 4</a>. The man of violence is one who "grinds the faces of the poor," and whose conduct is rapacious, violent, and unjust. <span class="accented">And choose none of his ways</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and choose not all his ways, i.e.</span> with a view to acquire the same wealth, greatness, and power. The LXX. renders this verse, "Do not acquire the hatred of evil men, neither be jealous of their ways," evidently from having taken <span class="accented">tiv'khar</span>, "choose," in the second hemistich, for <span class="accented">tith'khan</span>, "be jealous."

LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), is especially abhorrent to Jehovah. In some passages it is connected with idolatry, as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-24.htm">1 Kings 14:24</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>, but is never used in this sense in the Proverbs, where it occurs about twenty times (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1, 20</a>, etc.). The passage shows that prosperity and worldly success are not always a true measure of Divine favour. <span class="cmt_word">His secret</span> (<span class="accented">sodo</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">sermocinatio.</span> Here <span class="accented">sod</span> probably means "familiar intercourse," as in <a href="../../par/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; and hence the special favour with which Jehovah regards the upright, by revealing to them what he conceals item others, or his friendship (compare what our Lord says in <a href="../../par/john/15-14.htm">John 15:14, 15</a>). Dathe translates "probis vero est familiaris." Gesenius says <span class="accented">sod</span> properly means "a couch," or <span class="accented">triclinium</span> on which people recline; but Delitzsch derives it from the root sod, "to be firm," "compressed," and states that it therefore means properly "a being together, or sitting together." The LXX. eontinues the "froward man" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) as the subject, and renders, "Every transgressor is impure before God, and does not sit together with (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) the just."

In the verse before us a further reason is given why the prosperity of the wicked is not enviable. The curse of Jehovah dwells in and rests upon his house. <span class="accented">The curse</span>; <span class="accented">m'erah</span>, from <span class="accented">arav</span>, "to curse." This word only occurs five times in the Old Testament once in Deuteronomy, twice in Proverbs (here and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-27.htm">Proverbs 28:27</a>), and twice in Malachi. The nature of the curse may be learned from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>, where it is the infliction of temporal misfortunes ending with the "cutting off" of the wicked (see <a href="../../par/psalms/37-22.htm">Psalm 37:22</a>). It is a hovering evil, the source of constant misfortune. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. Cf.

Blessing does not exclude affliction, but "trials" are not "curses" (Wardlaw).
