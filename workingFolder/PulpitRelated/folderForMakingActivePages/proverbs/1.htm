In <a href="../../par/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7, 8</a> it is used of the prophetic predictions of Balaam; certain didactic psalms, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a> and Psalm 78:2, are so designated, and in Job (<a href="../../par/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a> and Job 29:1) it describes the sententious discourses of wise men. While all these come under the generic term of <span class="accented">m'shalim</span>, though few or no comparisons are found in them, we find the term <span class="accented">mashal</span> sometimes used of what are proverbs in the sense of popular sayings. Compare "Therefore it became a proverb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>), Is Saul also among the prophets?" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a>); and see also other instances in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a> and Ezekiel 18:2. In this sense it is also found in the collection before us. The predominant idea of the term, however, is that of comparison or similitude, and as such it is better represented by the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> (from  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, "to set or place side by side"), literally, a placing beside, or comparison, than by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "a byword," or "a trite wayside saying," though in the Greek of the synoptic Gospels <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. The English word "proverb" insufficiently renders the wider scope of meaning conveyed in the Hebrew <span class="accented">mashal</span>, and is not quite accurately rendered here, since of proverbs in our ordinary signification of that word there are comparatively few in this collection. The Hebrew word here means "maxims," "aphorisms," "wise counsels." <span class="accented">Of Solomon.</span> Most modern commentators (Delitzsch, Zockler, Fuerst, Stuart, Plumptre, etc.), while attributing, in a greater or less degree, the authorship of the book to Solomon, regard the insertion of his name in the title as indicating rather that he is the dominant spirit among those wise men of his age, some of whose sayings are here incorporated with his own. <span class="cmt_word">King of Israel</span>, as forming the second hemistich of the verse, goes with "Solomon," and not "David." This is indicated in the Authorized Version by the position of the comma. The Arabic Version omits allusion to David, and reads, "Proverbia, nempe documenta Salomonis sapientis, qui regnavit super filios Israel." The proverbial or parabolic form of teaching was a recognized mode of instruction among the Hebrews, and in the Christian Church is recommended by St. Clement of Alexandria ('Strom.,' lib. 11, <span class="accented">init.</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To know wisdom and instruction.</span> In this verse we have a statement of the first general aim or object of the Proverbs. "To know" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">ladaath</span>) is somewhat indefinite in the Authorized Version, and might be more accurately rendered. "from which men may know" (De Wette, Noyes); cf. <span class="accented">unde scias</span> (Munsterus). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> which is here prefixed to the infinitive, as in vers. 2, 8, and 6, gives the clause a final character, and thus points out the object which the teaching of the Proverbs has in view. The teaching is viewed from the standpoint of the learner, and hence what is indicated here is not the imparting of knowledge, but the reception or aprrspriation thereof on the part of the laemer. Schultens states that the radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">daath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the reception of knowledge into one's self. <span class="accented">Wisdom.</span> It will be necessary to go rather fully into this word here on its first appearance in the text. The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">khokhmah</span>). Wisdom is mentioned first, because it is the end to which all knowledge and instruction tend. The fundamental conception of the word is variously represented as either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the "power of judging," derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, "to be wise," from the Arabic, "to judge" (Oesenlus); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the fixing of a thing for cognition," derived from the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, as before, which signifies "to fasten" (Zockler), or "compactness," from the same root as before, "to be firm, or closed." It is also variously defined <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as "<span class="accented">insight</span> into that upright dealing which pleases God - a <span class="accented">knowledge</span> of the right way which is to be followed before God, and of the wrong one which is to be shunned" (Zockler); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as "piety towards God," as in <a href="../../par/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> (Gesenius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as "the knowledge of things in their being and in the reality of their existence" (Delitzsch), The word is translated in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">sapientia.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">khokhmah</span> and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> so far agree as philosophical terms in that the end of each is the same, viz. the striving after objective wisdom, the moral fitness of things; but the character of the former differs from that of the latter in being distinctly religious. The beginning and the end of the <span class="accented">khokhmah</span>, wisdom, is God (cf. ver. 7). Wisdom, then, is not the merely scientific knowledge, or moral philosophy, but knowledge <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> religious knowledge or piety towards God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an appreciation of what God requires of us and what we conversely owe to God. "Sapientia est de divinis" (Lyra). Wisdom will, of course, carry with it the notions of knowledge and insight. <span class="accented">Instruction.</span> As the preceding word represents wisdom in its intellectual conception, and has rather a theoretical character, so "instruction," Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>), represents it on its practical side, and as such is its practical complement. The Hebrew <span class="accented">musar</span> signifies properly "chastisement," from the root <span class="accented">yasar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), "to correct," or "chastise," and hence education, moral training; and hence in the LXX. it is rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, which means both the process of education (cf. Plato, 'Repub.,' 376, E.; Arist., 'Pol.,' 8, 3) and its result as learning (Plato, 'Prob.,' 327, D.). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">disciplina.</span> In relation to wisdom, it is antecedent to it; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to know wisdom truly we must first become acquainted with instruction, and hence it is a preparatory step to the knowledge of wisdom, though here it is stated rather objectively. The words, "wisdom and instruction," are found in exactly the same collocation in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-13.htm">Proverbs 4:13</a> and Proverbs 23:23. In its strictly disciplinary sense, "instruction" occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>, with which comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>. Holden takes this word as "moral discipline" in the highest sense. <span class="cmt_word">To perceive the words of understanding;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to discern the words of discernment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to comprehend the utterances which proceed from intelligence, and give expression to  it" (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">vinah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), connected with the hiph. (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">l'havin</span>), properly "to distinguish," hence "to discern," of the same clause, signifies the capability of discerning the true from the false, good front bad, etc. With this agrees Cornelius a Lapide, who says, "Unde prudenter discernas inter bonum et malum, licitum et illicitum, utile et noxium, verum et falsum," and from which you are enabled to know what to do in any circumstances, and what not to do. The LXX. renders the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate by <span class="accented">prudentia.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato and Aristotle, is the virtue concerned in the government of men, manage-merit of affairs, and the like (see Plato, 'Sym.,' 209, A.; Arist.,' Eth.,' N. 6, 5 and 8), and means practical wisdom, prudence, or moral wisdom. Van Ess, Allioli, Holden, translate "prudence." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To receive the instruction of wisdom.</span> This verse carries on the statement of the design of the Proverbs. <span class="accented">To receive</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">lakakhath</span>), not the same word as "to know" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>), in ver. 2, though regarded as synonymous with it by Delitzsch. Its meaning is well represented by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and the Authorized Version "to receive." The Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, is infinitive, and means properly "to take, or lay hold of," hence "to receive," Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, No doubt it conveys the idea of intellectual reception (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>). <span class="accented">The instruction of wisdom</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">musar has'kel</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the discipline or moral training which leads on to reason, intelligence, or wisdom (as Hitzig, Fuerst, Zockler); or discipline full of insight, discernment, or thoughtfulness (as Umbreit, Ewald, Delitzsch). The phrase does not mean the wisdom which instruction imparts. The <span class="accented">word musar</span> occurs here in a slightly different sense from its use in ver. 2; there it is objective, here its meaning as a medium for the attainment of wisdom is more distinctly brought out. <span class="accented">Wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">haskel</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> properly "thoughtfulness" (so Umbreit. Ewald, Delitzsch, Plumptre). It is strictly the infinitive absolute of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">sakal</span>), "to entwine or involve," and as a substantive it stands for the thinking through of a subject, so "thoughtfulness." The LXX. renders this sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>, which St. Jerome understands as "versutias sermonum et solutiones aenigmatum" ("the cunning or craftiness of words and the explication of enigmas"). <span class="cmt_word">Justice, and judgment, and equity.</span> These words seem to be the unfolding of the meaning contained in the expression, "the instruction of wisdom." Holden regards the last four words as objective genitives dependent on "instruction," but wrongly. Cornelius a Laplde states that "justice and judgment and equity" indicate the same thing in different aspects. "<span class="accented">Justice</span> stands for the thing itself - that which is <span class="accented">just</span>; <span class="accented">judgment</span> in respect of right reason, which says it is just; and <span class="accented">equity</span> in respect of its being agreeable to the Law of God." <span class="accented">Justice</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">tsadak</span>), "to be right, or straight;" in a moral sense it means "rectitude," "<span class="accented">right</span>," as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> (Gesenius). The underlying idea is that of straightness. Heidenheim, quoted by Delitzsch, maintains that in <span class="accented">tsedek</span> the conception of the <span class="accented">justum</span> prevails; but the latter enlarges its meaning, and holds that it also has the idea of a mode of thought and action regulated, not by the letter of the Law, but by love, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. Plumptre thinks "righteousness" would be a better translation of the word, on the ground that the Hebrew includes the ideas of truth and beneficence. Compare with this the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. Zockler also renders "righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is in accord with the will and ordinances of God as Supreme Judge." In the Authorized Version, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>, where we have the same collocation of words, <span class="accented">tsedek is</span> translated "righteousness;" cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>, "He who utters truth shows forth righteousness (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>)." <span class="accented">Judgment</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">mish'pat</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shapat</span>), "to adjust, judge," corresponds with the Hebrew in meaning; it is the delivery of a correct judgment on human actions. Compare the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented">Equity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rectitude in thought and action (Delitzsch), or integrity (Zockler). This quality expresses upright demeanour or honoumble action on one's own part individually, while "judgment" has regard both to our own and the actions of others. The Hebrew, <span class="accented">mesharim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), used only in the plural, is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">yashar</span>), "to be straight or even," and is equal to "uprightness." The plural form is reproduced in the marginal reading "equities;" comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>, "Let thine eyes beheld the things that are equal (<span class="accented">mesharim</span>)." The Vulgate reads <span class="accented">aequitas</span> and the Syriae <span class="accented">rectitudo.</span> The two ideas in judgment and equity appear to be expressed in the LXX. by the phrase. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>.

We have this idea expressed as follows in <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, "The prudent man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">arum</span>) foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself." In the Arabic Version it is rendered by <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, "shrewdness," in a good sense. The Hebrew <span class="accented">ar'mah</span>, like the Latin <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, also means "craftiness," as appears in the use of the cognate adjective <span class="accented">arum</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where we read, "The serpent was more subtle," etc. For "subtilty" the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a Greek word which appears to be employed altogether in a bad sense, as "trickery," "villainy," "knavery;" but that scarcely appears to be the meaning of the Hebrew here, since the aim of the Proverbs is ethical and beneficial in the highest degree. The Vulgate <span class="accented">astutia</span>, the quality of the <span class="accented">astutus</span>, beside the bad sense of craftiness, also boars the good sense of <span class="accented">shrewdness</span>, sagacity, and so better represents the Hebrew.

The LXX. properly renders the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "unknowing of evil." The same idea is indirectly expressed in the Vulgate <span class="accented">parvuli</span>, "the very young;" and the term is paraphrased in the Arabic Version, <span class="accented">iis in quibus non est malitia</span> ("those who are without malice").

The principle here enunciated is again stated in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>, "Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser," and finds expression under the gospel economy in the words of our Lord, "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>; cf. 25:29; <a href="../../par/mark/4-25.htm">Mark 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a> and Mark 14:26). <span class="accented">Learning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">lekakh</span>), in the sense of being transmitted or received (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Dunn). A man of understanding (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">intelligens</span>) is a person of intelligence who lays himself open to be instructed. <span class="accented">Wise counsels</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">takh'buloth</span>). This word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khevel</span>), a ship rope, a denominative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khovel</span>), and only occurs in the plural. It signifies those maxims of prudence by which a man may direct his course aright through life (cf. <span class="accented">regimen</span>, Arabic). The imagery is taken from the management of a vessel, and is reproduced in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">gubernatio.</span> "Navigationi vitam comparat" (Mariana).

In the only other passage where it is found it is used of God's power in turning about the clouds; cf. <a href="../../par/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12</a>, "And it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bright cloud] is turned round about by his counsels (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, <span class="accented">b'thakh'bulothau</span>)." It is the practical correlative of "learning," in the first part of the verse.

The end of the wise and intelligent man's increase in learning and prudence is that he may be thus enabled to understand other proverbs. Schultens, followed by Holden, takes the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">l'havin</span>) as a gerund, <span class="accented">intelligendo sententias.</span> This rendering does not represent the end, but points to the proverbs, etc., as means by which the wise generally attain to learning and prudence. <span class="cmt_word">And the interpretation;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m'litsah</span>). It is difficult to determine the exact meaning of this word. By Gesenius it is rendered "enigma, riddle;" by Bertheau and Hitzig, "discourse requiring  interpretation:" by Delitzsch, "symbol; by Havernick and Keil, "brilliant and pleasing discourse;" and by Fuerst, "figurative and involved discourse." By comparing it with the corresponding words, "dark sayings," it may be regarded as designating that which is obscure and involved in meaning; compare <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.). It only occurs here and in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>, where it is rendered "taunting proverb." The marginal reading is "an eloquent speech," equivalent to <span class="accented">facundia</span>, "eloquence."

In the latter they are described as "goads and as nails fastened by the ministers of assemblies" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "authors of compilations," as Mendelssohn), because they cannot fail to make an impression on everybody good or bad. The expression, as used in <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, implies that other than Solomonic proverbs are included in this collection. <span class="cmt_word">And their dark sayings;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">v'khidotham</span>).

It plainly has the sense of "enigma" (Fleischer, apud Delitzsch). Compare <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), and <span class="accented">aenigmata</span> (Vulgate), which latter is followed by the Chaldea Paraphrase and Syriac (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter <span class="accented">dark sayings</span> of old"). Gesenius derives it from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">khud</span>), "to tie knots," and hence arrives at its meaning as an involved or twisted sententious expression, an <span class="accented">enigma.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge: <i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7-ch. 9:18.</span> - Part II. INTRODUCTORY SECTION. The first main section of the book begins here and ends at <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>. It consists of a series of fifteen admonitory discourses addressed to youth by the Teacher and Wisdom personified, with the view to exhibit the excellence of wisdom, and generally to illustrate the motto, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge," or wisdom. It urges strong encouragements to virtue, and equally strong dissuasives from vice, and shows that the attainment of wisdom in its true sense is the aim of all moral effort. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.</span> This proposition is by some commentators regarded as the motto, symbol, or device of the book (Delitzsch, Umbreit, Zockler, Plumptre). Others, following the Masoretic arrangement of the Hebrew text, consider it as forming part of the superscription (Ewald, Bertheau, Elster, Keil). As a general proposition expressing the essence of the philosophy of the Israelites, and from its relation to the rest of the contents of this book, it seems rightly to occupy a special and individual position. The proposition occurs again in the Proverbs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, and it is met with in similar or slightly modified forms in other books which belong to the same group of sacred writings, that is, those which treat of religious philosophy - the Khokhmah; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>; Ecclus. 1:16, 25. With this maxim we may compare "The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a>). <span class="accented">The fear of the Lord</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">yir'ath y'hovah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the fear of Jehovah.</span> The expression describes that reverential attitude or holy fear which man, when his heart is set aright, observes towards God. The original word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">yir'ath</span>) for "fear," is properly the infinitive of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, (<span class="accented">yare</span>), "to fear or reverence," and as a substantive means "reverence or holy fear" (Gesenius). <span class="accented">Servile</span> or abject fear (as Jerome, Beda, Estius) is not to be understood, but <span class="accented">filial</span> fear (as Gejerus, Mercerus, Cornelius a Lapide, Cartwright), by which we fear to offend God - that fear of Jehovah which is elsewhere described as "to hate evil" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>), and in which a predominating element is love. Wardlaw remarks that the "fear of the Lord" is in invariable union with love and in invariable proportion to it. We truly fear God just in proportion as we truly love him. The fear of the Lord also carries with it the whole worship of God. It is observable that the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is used in the Hebrew, and not <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), a peculiarity which is invariably marked in the Authorized Version by small capitals. <span class="accented">The beginning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">reshith</span>). This word has been understood in three different senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As <span class="accented">initium</span>, the beginning; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the initial step or starting point at which every one who wishes to follow true wisdom must begin (Gejerus, Zockler, Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As <span class="accented">caput</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the most excellent or principal part, the noblest or best wisdom. This sense is adopted in the marginal reading (comp. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>) (Holden, Trapp). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> As the <span class="accented">principium</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the origin, or basis, as in <a href="../../par/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>, "She is the origin, or basis (<span class="accented">reshith</span>) of the sin of the daughter of Zion." Delitzsch regards the original, <span class="accented">reshith</span>, as embracing the two ideas of commencement and origin, in the same way as the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>. Wisdom has its origin in God, and  whoever fears him receives it if he prays in faith (cf. <a href="../../par/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, sqq.) (Vatablus, Mercerus, Delitzsch). That the first sense, viz. that of beginning, is to be understood here appears from the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a>, where the corresponding word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>. (<span class="accented">t'killath</span>), "beginning," from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khalal</span>), "to begin;" cf. also the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, in this sense, and the <span class="accented">initium</span> of the Syriac and Arabic Versions. All previous knowledge to "the fear of the Lord" is comparative folly. He who would advance in knowledge must first be imbued with a reverence or holy fear of God. But <span class="cmt_word">fools despise wisdom and instruction;</span> or, according to the inverted order of the words in the original, <span class="accented">wisdom and instruction fools despise</span>, the association of ideas in the three words, "knowledge," "wisdom," and "instruction," thus being more continuously sustained. This arrangement links on the two latter words with "the fear of the Lord," and so helps towards the elucidation of the sense in which "fools" is to be understood <span class="accented">Fools</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">evilim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">evil</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">aval</span>), "to be perverse," here properly designates the incorrigible, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>, and those who are unwilling to know God (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>), and hence refuse and despise wisdom and salutary discipline, those "who set at nought all his counsel, and will none of his reproof." The word is opposed to the "prudent" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>) and to the "wise" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>). Delitzsch understands it as "thick, hard, stupid," from the <span class="accented">root aval, coalescere, incrassari.</span> Schultens uses <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">erassi pro stupidis</span>, to represent the original. Dunn takes it in the same sense as "gross or dull of understanding." Fuerst, adopted by Wordsworth, regards it in the sense of having no moral stamina, from the root meaning "to be slack, weak, lax, or lazy." But none of these explanations seems, in my opinion, to coincide sufficiently with the evil and depraved activity expressed in the verb "despise," which follows, and which describes the conduct of this class. The LXX. renders the word or action by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">impii</span>, "godless," "profane," and the Vulgate by <span class="accented">stulti. Despise</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">bazu</span>) is perfect, but is properly translated by the present, because the perfect here represents a condition long continued and still existing (Gesenius, &sect; 126); cf. the Latin <span class="accented">odi</span>, <span class="accented">memini</span>, etc. The LXX. uses the future <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they will set at nought; the Vulgate, the present (<span class="accented">despiciunt</span>). The radical meaning is most probably contemptuous trampling under the feet (Geseuius). <span class="accented">Wisdom and instruction</span> (see ver. 2). The latter clause of this verse is antithetical to the former, but the antithesis is obscurely expressed. In the Authorized Version it is marked by the adversative conjunction "but," which, however, is not in the original. The LXX. has a striking interpolation in this verse between the first and second clauses, which is partly taken from <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "And a good understanding have all they that do it: and reverence towards God is the beginning of knowledge"). Compare the Arabic Version, which has the same interpolation: <span class="accented">Et intellectus bonus onmibus facientibus eam. Sana religio in Deum est initium prudentiae.</span>

The transition in this verse from what may be regarded as filial obedience towards God to filial obedience towards parents is suggestive of the moral Law. The same admonition, in a slightly altered form, occurs again in ch. 6, "My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother" (cf. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>). <span class="accented">My son</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ben</span>), "a son."

In other passages of the Old Testament the teacher, on the other hand, is represented as a "father" (<a href="../../par/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a> <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-21.htm">2 Kings 2:21</a>). We find the same relation assumed in the New Testament, both by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>) and by St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-2.htm">1 John 5:2</a>); but under the economy of the gospel it has a deeper significance than here, as pointing to the "new birth," which, being a later revelation, lies outside the scope of the moral teaching of the Old Testament dispensation. <span class="accented">The instruction</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">musar</span>); as carrying with it the sense of disciplinary education (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">disciplina</span>; see also ver. 2), and of the correction with which it may be enforced (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13, 14</a>), the writer attributes appropriately to the father, while the milder <span class="accented">torah</span>, "law," he uses of the mother (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Father</span>. The nature of the exhortation conveyed in this verse requires that we should understand the terms "father" and "mother" in their natural sense as designating the parents of the persons addressed,  though a symbolical meaning has Been attached to them by the rabbis (see Rabbi Salomon, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.), "father" being understood as representing God, and "mother," the people. But the terms are more than merely figurative expressions (Stuart). Those who look upon the Proverbs as the address of Solomon to his son Rehoboam naturally take "father" as standing for the former. Naamah, in this case must be the mother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>). It is almost unnecessary to state that pious parents are presupposed, and that only that instruction and law can be meant which is not inconsistent with the higher and more perfect Law of God (Gejerus, Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And forsake not the law of thy mother.</span> <span class="accented">Forsake.</span> The radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">tittosh</span>) is that of "spreading," then of "scattering" (Aiken), and so the word comes to mean "forsake, reject, or neglect." The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">abjicere</span>, "to push away, reject." Cf. <span class="accented">abjicias</span> (Arabic). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">dimittas, i.e.</span> "abandon," and the Syriac, <span class="accented">obliviscaris, i.e.</span> "forget." <span class="accented">The law</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">torath</span>), construct case of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">yarah</span>), "to teach," hence here equivalent to "a law" in the sense of that which teaches - a precept (<span class="accented">doctrina</span>, Jun. et Tremell., Piscat., Castal., Versions). With one exception (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>), it is the term which always expresses the instruction given by Wisdom (Delitzsch). The law (<span class="accented">torah</span>) of the mother is that preceptive teaching which she imparts orally to her son, but <span class="accented">torah</span> is also used in a technical sense as <span class="accented">lex</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, that which is laid down and established, a <span class="accented">decretum</span> or <span class="accented">institutum</span>, and designates some distinct provision or ordinance, as the law of sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-7.htm">Leviticus 6:7</a>). In <a href="../../par/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> we find it employed to signify the whole body of the Mosaic Law (<span class="accented">sepher hatorah</span>)<span class="accented">. Mother.</span> Not inserted here as a natural expansion of the idea of the figure required by the laws of poetic parallelism (as Zockler), since this weakens the force of the passage. Mothers are mentioned because of their sedulousness in imparting instruction (Bayne). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they</span> (shall be) <span class="cmt_word">an ornament of grace unto thy head.</span> The sentiment here expressed is put forward as an inducement to youth to observe obedience towards the instruction of the father and the law of the mother, and the meaning is that, just as in popular opinion ornaments and jewels are supposed to set off the personal form, so obedience towards parents in the ways of virtue embellishes the moral character (Bayne, Cartwright, Holden). <span class="accented">An ornament</span> <span class="accented">of grace</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">liv'yath khen</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a wreath or garland of grace</span>. We meet with the same expression in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a>, "She [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom] shall give to thine head an ornament of grace." The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">liv'yah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">lavah</span>), "to wind a roll" (Delitzsch) or "to be joined closely with" (Gesenius), and hence signifies an ornament that is twisted, and so a wreath or garland. Gejerus and Schultens translate the phrase by <span class="accented">corolla gratiosa, i.e.</span> "a crown full of grace," and so meaning conferring or producing grace, just as the expression, "the chastisement of our peace" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>), means the chastisement bringing or procuring our peace. So again a "precious stone," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>, margin, "a stone of grace," is one conferring gracefulness. The marginal reading, "an adding" (<span class="accented">additamentum</span>, Vatablus), conveys, though obscurely, the same idea; and this sense is again reproduced in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut addatur gratia capiti suo</span> ("in order that grace may be added to thy head"). The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And chains about thy neck.</span> <span class="accented">Chains</span>; properly, <span class="accented">necklaces</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">anakim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">anak</span>), "a cellar or necklace;" the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or "golden collar," of the LXX., and <span class="accented">torques</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> twisted neckchain) of the Vulgate. There is a very apposite parallel to this verse in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20, 21</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>; see also <a href="../../par/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>). The gold chain round the neck was a mark of distinction, and was conferred on Joseph by Pharaoh when investing him with authority and dignity (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>), and on Daniel by Belshazzar in the same way (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; see <a href="../../par/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>). The mere adornment of the person with gold and pearls, without the further adornment of the moral character with Christian graces, is deprecated both by St. Paul and St. Peter (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>). <span class="accented">Neck</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gar'g'roth</span>) only occurs in the plural (Gesenius).

Verbs of this class are often applied to snares and craftiness (cf. the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">insidias nectere</span>, "to weave plots, or lay snares").

The LXX. paraphrases the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let us share in blood."

This sense agrees with the Vulgate <span class="accented">abscondamus tendiculas</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let us conceal snares." Delitzsch, however, holds that no word is to be understood with this verb, and traces the radical meaning to that of restraining one's self, watching, lurking. in the sense of <span class="accented">speculari</span>, "to watch for," <span class="accented">insidiari</span>, "to lay wait for." The two verbs combine what may be termed the apparatus, the arrangement of the plot and their lurking in ambush, by which they will await their victims. <span class="accented">For blood</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">l'dam</span>).

Vatablus, Cornelius a Lapide. and Gesenius support the latter view (cf. <a href="../../par/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, "They all lie in wait for blood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for bloodshed, or murder. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">dam</span>) may be also taken for life in the sense that "the blood is the life" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause.</span> The relation of the phrase.

The enticement here put before youth is the courage and boldness of their exploits (Wardlaw). The order of the words in the original is, "Let us swallow them up, as the grave, living," which sufficiently indicates the meaning of the passage. <span class="accented">Alive</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">khayyim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> "the living," refers to the pronomiual suffix in <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">niv'laem</span>), as in the Authorized Version and Zockler (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/124-3.htm">Psalm 124:3</a>). Umbreit and Hitzig are grammatically incorrect in connecting <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">kish'ol</span>) "as the grave," with "the living," and translating "like the pit (swallows) that which lives." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;</span> (<span class="accented">ki</span>) with a substantive, as here in <span class="accented">kish'ol</span>, is a preposition, said not a conjunction (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon'). It denotes a kind of resemblance, but does not introduce a coordinate sentence. The allusion is undoubtedly in the teacher's mind to the fate of Korah and his company (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30-33</a>), and as in that case "the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up" in the flush of life, so here the robbers say that they will as suddenly and effectively destroy their victims, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">dala</span>); from which <span class="accented">niv'laem</span>, in a figurative sense, means "to destroy utterly" (Geseuius). The change from the singular, "the innocent" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">l'naki</span>), to the plural in "let us swallow <span class="accented">them</span> up," is noticeable. <span class="accented">Like the pit</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">kish'ol</span>); literally, <span class="accented">like Sheol</span>, or <span class="accented">Hades</span>, the great subterranean cavity or world of the dead. The all-devouring and insatiable character of sheol is described in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>, where the Authorized Version translates "Hell (<span class="accented">sheol</span>) and destruction are never full," and again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, where it (<span class="accented">sheol</span>, Authorized Version, "the grave") is classed with the four things that are never satisfied. Vulgate, <span class="accented">infernus</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. And whole, as those that go down into the pit. The parallelism of ideas requires that the word "whole" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">t'mimim</span>) should be understood of those physically whole (see Mercerus, Delitzsch), and not in a moral sense, as the <span class="accented">upright</span> (Luther, Grief, Holden, Plumptre). The word is used in an ethical signification in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a>. Gesenius gives it the meaning of "safe, secure." <span class="accented">Those that go down into the pit</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">yorde vor</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dead. The phrase also occurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/143-7.htm">Psalm 143:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). <span class="accented">The pit</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">vor</span>); or, <span class="accented">the sepulchre</span>, the receptacle of the dead, is here synonymous with <span class="accented">sheol.</span> The LXX. substitutes for the latter part of the verse, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "And let us remove his memory from the earth." The robbers, by drawing a comparison between themselves and Hades and the grave, which consign to silence all who are put therein, imply their own security against detection. They will so utterly destroy their victims that none will be left to tell the tale (see Musset, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). This, we know, is a fancied, and at the best only a temporary, security.

A short cut to wealth, and to the acquirement of that which costs others long years of steady application and carefulness, is a strong inducement (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">We shall find</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">nim'tza</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">matza</span>), properly "to reach to," and "to find," in the sense of "to come upon;" cf.

Substance</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">hon</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> substance in the sense of riches. The radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hun</span>), from which it is derived, is the same as in the Arabic word, "to be light, easy, to be in easy circumstances, and so to be rich" (Gesenius). In its abstract sense, <span class="accented">hon</span>, "substance," means ease, comfort, and concretely riches which bring about that result (see also Fleischer, as quoted by Delitzsch); cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> collectively, possessions, property. The Piscatoris Version, for "precious substance," reads <span class="accented">divitias</span>, "riches." <span class="accented">Precious</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">yakar</span>), properly " heavy," is found with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hon</span>), "substance," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a> and Proverbs 24:4. The collocation of the ideas of lightness and heavineess in these two words is striking, but we need not necessarily suppose that any oxymoron is intended, as Schnltens. Such combinations occur in other languages, and reside more in the radical meanings of the words than in the mind or intention of the writer or speaker. <span class="cmt_word">We shall fill our houses with spoil</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they promise not only finding, but full possession (Gejerus, Muffet). <span class="accented">Spoil</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">shalal</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">shalal</span>), same as the Arabic verb "to draw," and hence "to strip off' (Gesenius); and equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), the arms stripped off a slain enemy, spoils, and the Latin <span class="accented">spolia</span> (Vulgate). <span class="accented">Shalal</span> is used generally, as here, for "prey," "booty" (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>). Our gains, say  the robbers, will not only be valuable, but numerous and plentiful.

The sense is, "you shall equally with the others cast lots for your share of the spoil" (Zockler, Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">Let us all have one parse.</span> <span class="accented">Purse</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="accented">kis</span>), the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the LXX., the <span class="accented">marsupium</span> of the Vulgate, is the receptacle in which money is placed for security. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a> it is used for the bag in which traders kept their weights, "the weights of the bag;" and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31</a> it is translated "cup," the wine cup. It here signifies the common stock, the aggregate of the gains of the robbers contributed to a common fund. The booty captured by each or any is to be thrown into one common stock, to form one purse, to be divided by lot among all the members of the band. On this community of goods among robbers, compare the Hebrew proverb, <span class="accented">In localis, in poculis, in ira.</span> Community of goods among the wicked carries with it community in crime, just as the community of goods among the early Christians implied community in good works and in the religious sentiments of the Christian body or Church. The Rabbi Salomon Isacides offers another explanation (which leaves the choice open to youth either to share in the spoil by lot, or to live at the expense of a common fund, as he may prefer): "Si voles, nobiscum spolia partieris, si etiam magis placebit, sociali communique marsupio nobiscum vives" - "If thou wilt, thou shalt share with us the booty; ay, if it like thee more, thou halt live with us on a confederate and common purse" (see Cornelius a Lapide).

Refrain</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">m'na</span>) is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">mana</span>), "to keep back, restrain;' LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/119-101.htm">Psalm 119:101</a>, "I have refrained my feet from every evil way;" <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a>, "Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet"). Restraining the foot carries with it indirectly the natural inclination or propensity of the heart, even of the good, towards evil (Cartwright). <span class="accented">Foot</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">regel</span>) is, of course, used metaphorically, and means less the member of the body than the idea suggested by it; hence the use of the singular (Gejerus, Delitzsch). Bayne remarks that the Hebrews understood this passage as meaning "neither in public nor private life have any dealings with sinners." <span class="accented">Path</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">nathiv</span>) is a beaten path, a pathway, a byway; from the unused root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">nathav</span>), "to tread, trample;" and hence, while "way" may mean the great public high road, "path" may stand for the bypath, less frequented or public. The same distinction probably occurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>, "Show me thy ways, O Lord; and teach me thy paths." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</span> This is the first dissuasive urged to enforce the warning against evil companionship, as showing the extremes to which entering upon the ways of the wicked lead ultimately. At once the youth who listens will be hurried along impetuously to the two crimes of robbery and murder, which God has expressly forbidden in the eighth and sixth commandments respectively of the moral code. <span class="accented">Evil</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, <span class="accented">ra</span>) is "wickedness," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, generally, but here more specifically highway robbery, latrocinism (Cornelius a Lapide), as appears from vers. 11-13, where also murder, the laying in wait for blood, is proposed. The Rabbis Salomon and Salazar understand the evil to refer to the evil or destruction  which sinners bring upon themselves, and the shedding of blood to the fact that they lay themselves open to have their own blond shed by judicial process (see also Holden). The former explanation seems preferable to this, as putting a higher law than that of self-preservation before youth. The fear of judges who can condemn to death is notbing comparatively to the fear of him "who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell." This verse is wanting in the Vatican LXX., and Arabic, and hence Hitzig has concluded that it is an interpolation made from <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, but upon insufficient evidence, as it is found in the Alexandrian LXX., Chaldea Paraphrase, Vulgate, and Syriac Versions, all which follow the Hebrew text.

It is based on the ill-advised audacity of sinners in flying in the face of God's judgments. <span class="accented">In vain</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">khinnam</span>), see ver. 11, may be taken in two senses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to no purpose, <span class="accented">gratis, frustra</span> (Vulgate, Chaldee Paraphrase, Arabic).

So sinners, when they are plotting for others, plunge into their own destruction with their eyes open. Therefore do not associate with them, do not imitate their crass folly, be warned by their example, or you will share their fate. This view is supported by the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For not unreasonably is the net spread before birds;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they fall into the snare (see Luther, Patrick, Umbreit, Ewatd, Hitzig, Zockler, Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others, as Delitzsch, Ziegler, Beda, Doderlein, Bertheau, Wardlaw, take <span class="accented">khinnam</span> in a different sense, as indicating the escape of the birds - the birds see the snare and fly away, and so in vain the net is spread in their sight. This explanation is in agreement with Ovid's statement, "Quae nimis apparent retia vitat avis." The moral motive put before youth in this case is the aggravation of his guilt if he listens to the enticements of sinners.

They propose, as they say, to lay wait for the blood of others; but it is, says the teacher, for their own blood. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">l'dhammam</span>), <span class="accented">contra sanguinem suum</span>; they lurk privily. as they say, for the innocent, but in reality it is for their own lives; <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">l'naph'shotham</span>); <span class="accented">contra animus suas</span> (Vulgate); or, as the LXX. puts it, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>, "For they who take part in murder treasure up evils for themselves;" that is, they am bringing a heavier and surer destruction upon themselves than they can ever inflict upon others (Wardlaw).

The idea of greed and covetousness enters largely into the word. Which <span class="cmt_word">taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</span> The pronoun "which" does not occur in the original. The nominative to "taketh away" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">yikkath</span>) is "gain;" the "unjust gain." (<span class="accented">betsa</span>) takes away the life of its owners, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of those who are under its power. <span class="accented">Owners thereof</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">b'alayo</span>) does not necessarily imply that they are in actual possession of the unjust gain, but rather refers to the influence which the lust for gain exercises over them. The expression in this second hemistich does not mean that the rapacious take the life of their comrades who possess the gain, as Rabbi Salomon; nor as the Vulgate, "the ways of the avaricious man take away the lives of those who possess them." For the phrase, "taketh away the life," as importing a violent taking away, cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>. The sentiment of the verse is well expressed in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, "For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-33.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">Second admonitory discourse. Address of Wisdom personified, exhibing the folly of those who wilfully reject, and the security of those who hearken to, her counsels.</span> The sacred writer, in this section, as also in ch. 8, uses the rhetorical figure of prosopopceia, or impersonation. Wisdom is represented as speaking and as addressing the simple, scorners, and fools. The address itself is one of the noblest specimens of sacred eloquence, expressing in rapid succession the strongest phases of feeling - pathetic solicitude with abundant promise, indignant scorn at the rejection of her appeal, the judicial severity of offended majesty upon offenders, and lastly the judicial complacency which delights in mercy towards the obedient. The imagery in part is taken from the forces of nature in their irresistible and overwhelming violence and destructive potency. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom crieth without.</span> <span class="accented">Wisdom</span>. The Hebrew word (<span class="accented">khochmoth</span>) here used to designate Wisdom seems to be an abstract derivation from the ordinary <span class="accented">khochmah.</span> The form is peculiar to the Proverbs and Psalms, in the former occurring four times (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a>), and in the latter twice only (viz. <a href="../../par/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>). As in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a> and Proverbs 24:7, it is a <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> of the feminine gender, a variety of the <span class="accented">pluralis extensivus</span>, as Bottcher prefers to denominate it. The feminine form may he determined by the general law which associates purity and serenity with womanhood (Plumptre). The idea of plurality, however, is not that of extension, but of comprehension, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is not so much all kinds of wisdom which is presented to us, as all the varieties under which wisdom <span class="accented">par excellence</span> may be regarded and is comprehended. The plural form of the word denotes the highest character or excellence in which wisdom can be conceived; or, as the marginal reading expresses it, wisdoms, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> excellent wisdom. Other instances of the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> are met with in Holy Writ, <span class="accented">e.g. Elohim</span>, God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "God of Gods," either from the polytheistic view, or from the monotheistic view as expressive of God's might in manifestation, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <span class="accented">k'doshim</span>, "the Holy (God)," <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>; <span class="accented">adonim</span>, for <span class="accented">adon</span> "lord" (Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 108. 2 <span class="accented">b</span>). In the conception of Wisdom here presented to us in the text we have the germ of an idea which, on the principles of expansion, developed subsequently in the consciousness of the Christian Church into a definite identification of Wisdom with the Second Person of the blessed Trinity. There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="../../par/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>, where Christ speaks of himself as <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "the Wisdom of God," that shall send prophets and apostles into the world, and thereby identifies himself with Wisdom (cf. this with vers. 20, 21; ch. 7.). Again, a striking similarity is observable between the teaching of Divine Wisdom and that of the Incarnate Word, as much in their promises as in their threats and warnings. But it is difficult to determine with accuracy to what extent the Messianic import of the personification was present to the <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of the sacred writers, and whether Wisdom as here presented to us is simply a poetic and abstract personification or a distinct by-postatizing of the Word. Dorner ('Pers. of Christ,' Introd., p. 16), with reference to ch. 8:22, etc., says that though Wisdom is introduced speaking as a personality distinct from God, still the passage does not lead clearly to an hypostatizing of the Khochmah. Dollinger ('Heidenthum und Judenthum,' bk. 10. pt. 3. sec. 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc.) maintains that Wisdom is "the personified idea of the mind of God in creation," rather than the presence of "a distinct hypostasis." Lucke (see references in Liddon, 'Bampton Lects.') holds that in Proverbs Wisdom is merely a personification It is clear that whatever is predicated  of Wisdom in ch. 8. must be also predicated of her in the passage before us, in reference either to the hypostatic or opposite view. On the other hand, a large number of expositors, dating from the earliest periods of the Christian Church down to the present time, see in Wisdom a distinct hypostasis, or person - the Lord Jesus Christ. A fuller investigation of this subject will be seen in our remarks on ch. 8. For the present we observe that Wisdom is essentially Divine. Her authority, her utterances, whether of promise, threat, scorn, or vengeance, are the authority, the utterances, of God. <span class="accented">Crieth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">crieth loudly</span>, or <span class="accented">aloud.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">ranan</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) is "to vibrate the voice," and conveys the idea of the clear loud ringing tones with which proclamations were made; cf. the Vulgate <span class="accented">praedicare</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">clamitate</span>, "to cry with a loud voice." Fleischer remarks that the Arabic <span class="accented">rannan</span>, which is allied to the Hebrew verb, is used of a speaker who has a clear piercing voice. In such a way does Wisdom cry without when making her address. She elevates her voice that all may hear. The verb in the original is <span class="accented">tazonnah</span>, the feminine singular of <span class="accented">ranan</span>, and predicate to "Wisdom," according to the rule that verbs in the singular are construed with plural nouns having a singular signification, especially the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> (see Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 146. 2). <span class="accented">Without.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">bakhuts</span>) is here used adverbially, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a>, and signifies "in the open places," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> abroad, without, as opposed to the space within the walls. The writer here begins his enumeration of the five places wherein Wisdom preaches, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> without, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the streets, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in chief places of concourse, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> in the opening of the gates, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> in the city, all of which are public, and thus indicate the publicity of her announcements (with those comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-1.htm">Proverbs 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">She uttereth her voice;</span> or, <span class="accented">causeth her voice to be beard</span>; represented in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">dat vocem suam.</span> and in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (equivalent to "she observes free-spokenness"). The instrumentality which Wisdom uses in her public preaching are the prophets and teachers (Ecclus. 24:33; Zockler, Vatablus, Mercerus). <span class="cmt_word">In the streets;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the wide spares</span>; the Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">r'khovoth</span>), being, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>, "wide spaces," and corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the LXX.; <span class="accented">plateae</span>, Vulgate. The same places are indicated in <a href="../../par/luke/14-21.htm">Luke 14:21</a>, where, in the parable of the marriage supper, the servants are bidden to go out into the <span class="accented">streets</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) and lanes of the city. The word is connected with the adjective <span class="accented">rakhav</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>), "broad," "wide;" and in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a> is used to designate the ample space at the gates of Oriental cities (Gesenius), though here it seems to refer rather to "squares," large open spaces, not uncommon in Oriental cities - I saw one such at Aden - or it may refer to the broad crowded thoroughfares. The Syriac reading, in <span class="accented">compitis</span>, gives a different sense, as <span class="accented">compitum</span>, equivalent to "crossroads."

The publicity of the teaching of Wisdom, observable in the places she selects for that purpose, also marked the public ministry of our Lord and his disciples, and finds an illustration in his command, "What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> give it all the publicity possible.

The mockers are those who hold all things in derision, both human and Divine, who contemn God's admonitions, and treat with ridicule both threatenings and promises alike. <span class="cmt_word">Fools</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">ch'silim</span>), a different word from the <span class="accented">evilim</span> of ver. 7, but signifying much the same, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the obdurate, the hardened, <span class="accented">stolidi</span>, those who walk after the sight of their eyes and the imagination of their hearts - a class not ignorant of knowledge, but hating it because of the restraint it puts them under. The word occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>, in the sense of the incorrigible; in <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-3.htm">Proverbs 26:3, 4</a> as a term of the greatest contempt. The <span class="accented">enallage</span>, or interchange of tenses in the original - the verbs "love" and "hate" being future, and "delight" being perfect - is not reproducible in English. The perfect is used interchangeably with the future where the action or state is represented as first coming to pass or in progress, and, as Zockler remarks, may be inchoative, and so be rendered "become fond of," instead of "be fond of." But it appears to represent not so much a state or action first coming to pass as in progress (see Geseuius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 126, 3). Bottcher (&sect; 948, 2) translates it by <span class="accented">concupiverint, i.e.</span> "How long shall ye have delighted in scorning?" The futures express "love" and "hate" as habitual sentiments (Delitzsch). It is to be noted that the language of Wisdom, in vers. 22 and 23, is expressive of the most tender and earnest solicitude.

The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> conveys the argumentative conviction which will be present in the reproof.

The outflow of the Spirit of Wisdom will be like the abundant and continuous gushing forth of water from the spring or fountain. The verb unites in it the figures of abundant fulness and refreshing invigoration (Umbreit, Elster); comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-171.htm">Psalm 119:171</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:1</a>. We have here striking anticipation of the prophecy of Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). The Spirit is that of Wisdom "and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and godly strength, the Spirit of knowledge and true godliness" (see Confirmation Office). The explanation of Beda, that it signifies her anger, is clearly inadmissible. <span class="cmt_word">I will make known my words unto you;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the LXX., "I will teach you my word" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>), or as the Vulgate "show" (<span class="accented">ostendam</span>), "expound, or make clear." <span class="accented">My words</span> (<span class="accented">d'vari</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> precepts, or doctrine, or secrets. An intimate relation subsists between the "Spirit" of Wisdom and her "words," with which it is parallel. The former is the illuminating, invigorating principle which infuses life and power into the "words" of Wisdom, which she has already given, and which are already in our possession. Wisdom stands in the same relation to her words as the Divine Logos does to his utterances, into which he infuses himself. "It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" (<a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>.

The terrific nature of the punishment of the wicked is marked by a succession of terms all of terrible import - calamity, fear, desolation, destruction, distress, and anguish (vers. 26, 27). When these come upon them, then Wisdom will laugh and have them in derision. The verbs "laugh" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, <span class="accented">sakhak</span>) and "mock" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>) are the same as in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, where they are rendered "to mock" and "have in derision." <span class="cmt_word">When your fear cometh;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has actually arrived. <span class="accented">Fear</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">pakhad</span>); here used metonymically for that which causes the fear or terror (<span class="accented">id, quod timebatis</span>, Vulgate).

The change in this verse from the second to the third person is striking. It  implies that Wisdom thinks fools no longer worthy of being addressed personally - "Quasi stultos indignos censunt ulteriori alloquio" (Gejerus and Michaelis). The declaration is the embodiment of the laughter and scorn of ver. 26. The three verbs, "they shall call," "they shall seek," "they shall find," occur in uncommon and emphatic forms in the original. They are some out of the few instances where the future terminations are inserted fully before the pronominal suffix. <span class="cmt_word">I will not answer</span>. The distress and anguish consequent upon their calamity and fear lead them to pray, but there will be no answer nor heed given to their cry. They are not heard, because they do not cry rightly nor in the time of grace (Lapide). See the striking parallel to the tenor of this passage in <a href="../../par/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24-28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall seek me early;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> diligently. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakhar</span>) is the denominative from the substantive <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakar</span>), "the dawn, morning," and signifies to go out and seek something in the obscurity of the morning twilight (Delitzsch, Zockler), and hence indicates diligence and earnestness in the search. Gesenius gives the same derivation, but connects it with the dawn in the sense of the light breaking forth, and thus, as it were, seeking (see also Proverbs 2:27; 7:15; 8:17; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>).

When we are punished, the blameworthiness lies not with God, but with us sinners (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be filled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, or <span class="accented">surfeited</span>; <span class="accented">saturabuntur</span> (Vulgate). The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">shava</span>) means not only "to fill," but "to be satiated or cloyed" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-16.htm">Proverbs 25:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>). Michaelis remarks on this word, "Ad nauseam implebuntur et comedent, ita ut consiliorum suorum vehementer tandem, sed nimis sero, ipsos poeniteat" (Michaelis, 'Notre Uberiores in Prov.'), "They shall be filled and eat <span class="accented">ad nauseam</span>, so that at length, but too late, they shall vehemently repent them of their own counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Counsels</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">moetsoth</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ungodly counsels, or evil devices. The word only occurs in the plural. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a></div><div class="verse">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - Wisdom now brings her address to a close by contrasting the destruction and ruin of the foolish, and the security of those who listen to her voice. <span class="cmt_word">The turning away;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m'shuvah</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>(<span class="accented">shuv</span>), "to turn about, or to return" (which is used metaphorically of conversion), here means <span class="accented">defection</span>, turning away; and hence apostasy (<span class="accented">aversio</span> Vulgate, Chaldee Paraphrase, Syriac; <span class="accented">perversitio</span>, Cast. Version); the "backsliding" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>. Abea Ezra understands it to signify "ease," as in the marginal reading; but there seems no warrant for taking the word in that sense. The LXX. renders the passage quite differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> "For because they wronged the young, they shall be slain;" so also the Arabic. The turning away is from the warnings and invitations of Wisdom, and implies <span class="accented">rebelliousness</span> against God. <span class="cmt_word">The prosperity</span>. The word in the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">shal'vah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> here used in a bad sense, and means "carelessness, indolence," that carnal security which is induced by prosperity and worldly success, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>, "I spoke to thee in thy prosperity (security), but thou saidst, I will not hear" (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, where it is translated "idleness." So Dathe translates, "Incuria ignavorum eos perdit." The Chaldee Paraphrase and Syriac Versions read "error." It occurs in a good sense as "tranquillity," "security," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>. The derivation of the word is  from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">shalah</span>). "to be tranquil, to be safe, secure." Marines remarks that it is more difficult to bear prosperity than adversity, because we endure adversity, we are corrupted by prosperity, and prosperity or ease makes fools mad. The false security of the prosperous is illustrated by our Lord in his parable of the rich fool (<a href="../../par/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>). The LXX. differs again from the Hebrew in the second clause of this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the carefully considered judgment of God concerning them shall destroy them. The LXX, is followed by the Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">Them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fools themselves, and not other sinners, as Ben Ezra says, though the apparent security of fools, the impunity with which they seem to go on in their wickedness, and the success of their plans, may lead others to destruction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-33.htm">Proverbs 1:33</a></div><div class="verse">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearkeneth unto me.</span> Wisdom, in closing her address, draws a beautiful picture of the real security and peace of the righteous, as contrasted with the false security of the wicked. As on the one side rejection of her counsels, her warnings, and invitations, carries with it punishment and irretrievable ruin; so, on the other, the hearkening to her words, and loving obedience, are rewarded by her with the choicest blessings. <span class="cmt_word">Shall dwell safely</span>; that is, with confidence, without danger (<span class="accented">absque terrore</span>, Vulgate). The phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">shachan betakh</span>)<span class="accented">, is</span> used in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12-18</a> of the safety with which the covenant people should dwell in the land that God had given them; but it is capable of a further extension of meaning beyond mere temporal security, viz. to the spiritual peace of the righteous. The psalmist also employs it to describe the confidence with which he awaits the resurrection, when he says, "My flesh also shall rest in hope [or, 'dwell confidently']" (<a href="../../par/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>). So here Wisdom promises that he who hearkens to her shall dwell calmly and undisturbed amidst the distractions of the world. The promise agrees with the description of Wisdom elsewhere that "her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace." <span class="cmt_word">And shall be quiet;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">shaanan</span>, perfect pilel). Wisdom regards her assurance as already accomplished, and hence the perfect in the original is used for the future. The hearers and doers of her will shall live in tranquillity; nay, they are already doing so. It is a thing not only in prospect, but in possession. <span class="cmt_word">From fear of evil;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either without any fear of evil, fear being removed (<span class="accented">timore sublato</span>, Vulgate), or, as the Authorized Version expresses it, connecting the phrase more intimately with the verb - "quiet from fear of evil." It is not only evil, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">raah</span>), in its substantial form, as calamity, they are to be free from, but even the fear of it. The tranquillity will be supreme. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/150.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 150"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 150" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
