Rain falls in the usual course of things only at stated times; whence arose the phrase of "the early and of latter rains" (see on Proverbs 16:15). From spring to October or November was the dry season, and a storm at harvest time was regarded, not merely as destructive or inconvenient, but as portentous and even supernatural (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>, etc.). The two cases are types of all that is incongruous and unsuitable. The LXX., apparently regarding their experience in Egypt rather than the actual text, translate, "As dew in harvest, and as rain in summer." <span class="cmt_word">So honour is not seemly for a fool</span> (ver. 8; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>). It is quite out of place to show respect to a stupid and ungodly man, or to raise him to a post of dignity; such conduct will only confirm him in his folly, give others a wrong impression concerning him, and afford him increased power of mischief. The Greeks had a proverb about giving honour to unsuitable objects: they called it washing an ass's head with nitre. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a></div><div class="verse">As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying.</span> "Bird" (<span class="accented">tsippor</span>) is the sparrow, which is found throughout Palestine; "swallow" (<span class="accented">deror</span>), the free flier. The Authorized Version hardly gives the sense. The line should be rendered, <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">the sparrow in</span> (in respect of) <span class="accented">its wandering</span>, <span class="accented">as the swallow in its flying</span>. The point of comparison is the vagueness and aimlessness of the birds' flight, or the uselessness of trying to catch them in their course. <span class="cmt_word">So the curse causeless shall not come.</span> It shall, as it were, spend its force in the air, and fall not on the head on which it was invoked. A causeless curse is that which is uttered against one who has done nothing to deserve such denunciation. Septuagint, "As birds and sparrows fly, so a causeless (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) curse shall come upon no one" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-2.htm">Nehemiah 13:2</a>.) Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Blessings star forth forever; but a curse<br />Is like a cloud - it passes."</span> Closely connected with the superstition that dreads a curse is that which is alarmed by omens. Against this irrational fear we find some Eastern proverbs directed; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "The jackal howls: will my old buffalo die?" "The dog barks - still the caravan passes: will the barking of the dog reach the skies?" (Lane). Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "not," the Keri reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, "to him." This makes the proverb say that the unprovoked curse shall return upon him who uttered it. But this reading is not to be accepted, as it does not suit the terms of comparison, though it seems to have been used by St. Jerome, who translates, <span class="accented">Sic maledictum frustra prolatum in quempiam superveniet</span>. This retributive justice is often alluded to elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ver. 27 (where see note). So we find in various languages proverbs to the same effect. Thus in English, "Harm watch, harm catch;" Spanish, "Who sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot;" Turkish, "Curses, like chickens, always come home to roost;" Yoruba, "Ashes always fly back in the face of him that throws them" (Trench).

The animals used in riding were the ass and mule, and sometimes the camel. The Eastern ass is really a fine animal, larger, more spirited, and more active than the poor creature which we are wont to see. Or the whip and bridle may be intended to apply to both animals, though divided between the two for rhythmical or antithetical reasons (see on Proverbs 10:1). <span class="cmt_word">A rod for the fool's back.</span> Sharp correction is beth useful and necessary for the fool (so <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>). Similar treatment Siracides advises to be employed in the case of an idle servant (Ecclus. 30:24-28). Septuagint, "As a whip for a horse and a goad for an ass, so is a rod for a lawless nation."

Lest thou also be like unto him; lest you be led to utter folly yourself or to side with him in his opinions and practices. Our blessed Saviour never responded to foolish and captious questions in the way that the questioner hoped and desired, he put them by or gave an unexpected turn to them which silenced the adversary. Instances may be seen in <a href="../../par/matthew/21-23.htm">Matthew 21:23</a>, etc.; Matthew 22:21, 22; <a href="../../par/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/john/21-21.htm">John 21:21</a>, etc.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a></div><div class="verse">He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, <i>and</i> drinketh damage.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool.</span> This clause comes in the Hebrew after the next. <span class="cmt_word">Cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.</span> To entrust an important commission to a fool is to deprive one's self of the means of having it properly executed, and to bring upon one's self shame and injury. A man who is so silly as to employ such an unfit messenger, as it were, cuts off the feet which should bear him on his errand, and, instead of enjoying the satisfaction of seeing the business well performed, he will be mortified and damaged by the blunder and stupidity of his emissary. Septuagint, "He maketh for himself reproach from his own ways (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>,? <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) who sendeth a word by a foulish messenger." The Vulgate reads the first participle in a passive sense, <span class="accented">claudus pedibus</span>; but this is uneccessary. We have similar phrases to "drinketh damage" elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a> "drinketh in iniquity;" 34:7, "drinketh up scorn;" and with a different word, <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a>, "devoureth iniquity." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-7.htm">Proverbs 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">The legs of the lame are not equal: so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The legs of a lame man are not equal</span>. The first word of this verse, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, has occasioned some difficulty. It is considered as an imperative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, "draw off," "take away." Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But the verb seems never to have this meaning; nor, if it had, would the sense be very satisfactory, for. as Delitzsch points out, lame legs are better than none, and there is a great difference between the perfectly crippled or paralytic who has to be carried, and the lame man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>) who can limp or get along on crutches., And when we explain the proverb in this sense (as Plumptre), "Take away the legs of the lame man and the parable from the mouth of fools," for both alike ere useless to their possessors, and their loss would not be felt - we must recognize that the conclusion is not true. No one would think of amputating s man's legs simply because he was lame, and such a one's legs cannot be considered absolutely useless. Others regard the word as third plural kal, "the legs hang loose;" though the form is not sufficiently accounted for. All explanations of the word as a verbal form have such difficulties, that some take it as a noun, meaning "dancing," which is Luther's interpretation, "as dancing to a cripple, so it becometh a fool to talk of wisdom." But the word could never sightly anything but "limping," and could not express the elegant motion of dancing. The Authorized Version considers the Hebrew to mean, "are lifted up," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. are unequal, one being longer or stronger than the other; but this loses the force of the comparison. There seems to be no better interpretation than that mentioned above," The legs of the lame hang loose," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. are unserviceable, however sound in appearance. St. Jerome has expressed this, though in a strange fashion, "As it is vain for a lame man to have seemly legs." <span class="cmt_word">So is a parable in the mouth of a fool.</span> "Parable" (<span class="accented">mashal</span>), sententious saying, the enunciation of which, as well as the recital of stories, was always a great feature in Eastern companies, and afforded a test of a man's ability. A fool fails in the exhibition; he misses the point of the wise saying which he produces; it falls lame from his mouth, affords no instruction to others, and makes no way with its hearers. Siracides gives another reason for the incongruity, "A parable shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in its season" (Ecclus. 20:20). Septuagint, "Take away the motion of legs, and transgression (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>,? <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Lag.) from the mouth of fools." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-8.htm">Proverbs 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so <i>is</i> he that giveth honour to a fool.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he that bindeth a stone in a sling.</span> So Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. This gives a very good sense the point being either that the stone, after being firmly fitted in its place, quickly passes away from the sling, or, if more stress is laid on the word "bindeth," that the stone is so firmly fixed that it cannot be slung, and therefore never reaches the mark. The alternative rendering adopted by the Revised Version is this, "As a bag of gems in a heap of stones;" where the incongruity would consist either in exposing jewels on a cairn, or sepulchral monument, whence they could easily be filched, or in attracting undesirable attention. But there are grammatical and etymological reasons against this interpretation; and the Authorized Version is to be considered correct. The Vulgate is curious: <span class="accented">Sieur qui mittit lapidem in acervum Mercurii</span>. This rendering points to the custom, with which Jerome must have been familiar, of erecting statues of Mercury on the highways, which were thus placed under his protection. Round these statues were ranged heaps of stones, to which every wayfarer contributed by throwing a pebble as he passed. The absence of the critical faculty which discerned no absurdity in this anachronism is sufficiently remarkable. The Latin saying  seems intended to denote useless labour, as we speak of "carrying coals to Newcastle." <span class="cmt_word">So is he that giveth honour to a fool.</span> You pay respect to a fool, or place him in an honourable position, but your labour is wasted; he cannot act up to his dignity, he cannot maintain the honour; it passes away like the stone from the sling, or, if it remains, it is useless to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard.</span> There is here no idea of the drunkard's hand being pierced with a thorn while he is insensible to the pain, but rather of his being armed with it, and ripe for mischief. So it is best to render, "A thornbush cometh into the hand of a drunkard;" he somehow gets possession of it, and in his stupid excitement is liable to become dangerous. Some understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> of the growth of the thorn; thus the Septuagint, "Thorns grow in the hand of a drunkard;" Vulgate, "As if a thorn grew in the hand of a drunkard." But one does not see the bearing of such an expression; and the translation given above is more appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">So is a parable,</span> etc. (as ver. 7). In that passage the wise saying in a fool's mouth was compared with something useless, here it is compared with something injurious. He employs it purposely to wound others; or by the ignorant use of some sharp-edged word he does much mischief. In this hemistich the LXX. has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;</span> with a different vocalization, and renders, "servitude (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) in the hand of fools." This seems to mean that it comes natural to fools to be manacled and restrained by force. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-10.htm">Proverbs 26:10</a></div><div class="verse">The great <i>God</i> that formed all <i>things</i> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Few passages have given greater difficulty than this verse; almost every word has been differently explained. The Authorized Version is, <span class="cmt_word">The great God that formed all things</span> <span class="cmt_word">both rewardeth the fool, and</span> re-<span class="cmt_word">wardeth</span> transgressors; Revised Version, <span class="accented">As an archer</span> (<a href="../../par/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>) <span class="accented">that woundeth all</span>, <span class="accented">so is he that hireth the fool and he that hireth thorn that pass by</span>. At first sight one would hardly suppose that these could be versions of the same passage. To show the diversity that obtained in early times we quote the Greek and Latin versions. Septuagint, "All the flesh of fools is much distressed (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), for their distraction (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is brought to nought;" Vulgate, "Judgment decides causes, and he who imposes silence on a fool appeases wrath." From the various interpretations of which this proverb is capable, it may be surmised that it was originally one of those hard sayings which were intended to exercise the ingenuity of auditors. It has certainly had that effect in modern times. We may at once eliminate the rendering of the Authorized Version, though the sense is good and scriptural, denoting that the great Creator recompenses the good and punishes sinners. So the medieval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ante Dei vultum nihil unquam restat inultum."</span> God is not in the Hebrew, and <span class="accented">rab</span>, "great," is never used absolutely as equivalent to "God." Nor is the word used elsewhere to mean "head workman;" so the Revised Version margin, "a master worker formeth all things," is suspicious. Some translate, "A great man woundeth [equivalent to 'punisheth'] all; he renders their due to fools and to transgressors." One does not see why this should be attributed to the great man; it certainly is not generally true. Rosenmuller, "The mighty man causes terror; so does he who hires the fool and the transgressor;" but it is not clear why the hiring of a fool should occasion terror. The rendering in the Revised Version, or something very similar, has found favour with many modern commentators, though quite unknown to the mere ancient versions. According to this interpretation, the proverb says that a careless, random way of doing business, taking into one's service fools, or entrusting matters of importance to any chance loiterer, is as dangerous as shooting arrows about recklessly without caring whither they flew or whom they wounded. To this view Nowack objects that it is unparalleled to present an archer as a picture of what is unusual and profitless; that it does not explain why "hireth" is twice repeated; that the connection between shooter and the hire of fool and loiterer is net obvious; and that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> does not mean "vagabonds" or "passers by." None of these objections are of much importance; and this interpretation still holds its ground. There is also much to be said for the rendering of the Revised Version margin, which is virtually that of Gesenius, Fleischer, Wordsworth, Nutt, and others: A skilful man, a master workman, produces, makes, everything by his own care and superintendence; but he that hires a fool to do his work hires, as it were, any casual vagabond who may know nothing of the business. One objection to this interpretation is that the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, does not elsewhere have the meaning here attributed to it. Considering all the above interpretations unsatisfactory, Hitzig, after Umbreit, followed herein by Delitzsch and Nowack, translates, "Much bringeth forth all," which means that he who possesses much can do anything, or, as St. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>, "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>). But the second hemistich comes in rather lamely, "But he who hires a fool is as one who hires a vagabond." Hence Delitzsch reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> for the first <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, and renders, "But the hire and the hirer of the fool pass away," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. what the fool gets as wages is soon squandered, and the person who took him into his service is ruined by his incapacity. In this case the connection of the two clauses would be this: A rich man, in the nature of things, grows richer; but there are exceptions to this rule; for he who employs stupid and incapable people to do his business suffers for it in property, reputation, and probably in person also; and the incompetent person derives no benefit from the connection. It is impossible to give a decided preference to any of these expositions; and the passage must be left as a crux. It is most probable that the Hebrew text is defective. This would account for the great variations in the versions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a></div><div class="verse">As a dog returneth to his vomit, <i>so</i> a fool returneth to his folly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the dog returneth to his vomit</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>, which, however, is not quoted from the Septuagint), <span class="cmt_word">so a fool returneth to his folly;</span> or, <span class="accented">repeateth his folly</span>. The fool never frees himself from the trammels of his foolishness; his deeds and words always bear the same character to the end. The same truth holds good of the sinner, especially the drunkard and the sensualist. If they feel temporary compunction, and reject their sin by partial repentance, they do not really shake it off wholly; it has become a second nature to them, and they soon relapse into it. Septuagint, "As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes hateful, so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin." The LXX. adds a distich which is found in Ecclus. 4:21, "There is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that is glory and grace." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12</a></div><div class="verse">Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? <i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>). Nothing so shuts the door against improvement as self-conceit. "Woe unto them," says Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>), "that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight." Such persons, professing themselves wise, become fools (<a href="../../par/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17, 18</a>). Touching conceit, <span class="accented">Qui sibi sapit</span>, <span class="accented">summe desipit</span>.

A fool who is conscious of unwisdom may be set right; but one who fancies himself perfect, and needing no improvement, is beyond cure; his case is hopeless. So the sinner who feels and acknowledges his iniquity may be converted; but the self-righteous Pharisee, who considers himself to have no need of repentance, will never be reformed (see Matthew <a href="../../par/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>). St. Chrysostom (Hom. in Phil.,' 7), "Haughtiness is a great evil; it is better to be a fool than haughty; for in the one case the folly is only a perversion of intellect, but in the other ease it is still worse; for it is folly joined with madness. The fool is an evil to himself; but the haughty man is a plague to others too. One cannot be haughty-minded without being a fool...  The soul which is puffed up has a worse disease than dropsy, while that which is under restraint is treed from all evil" (Oxford transl.).

The words for "lion" are different in two parts of the verse, <span class="accented">shakhal</span> being the lion of advanced age, <span class="accented">ari</span> the full-grown animal; the latter may possibly be assumed to be the more dangerous of the two, and so a climax would be denoted.

Other analogies have been found in this proverb. Thus: The door opens to let the diligent go forth to his daily business, while the sluggard is rolling upon his bed; the door creaks when it is moved, so the lazy man groans when he is aroused; the door now is opened, now is shut, so the sluggard at one time intends to rise, and then falls back in his bed, and returns to his sleep (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-33.htm">Proverbs 24:33</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-16.htm">Proverbs 26:16</a></div><div class="verse">The sluggard <i>is</i> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit.</span> The sluggard is here one who is too idle to think a matter out, and considers his own cursory view as sure to be right. He is one who deems study to be an unnecessary weariness of the flesh (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:12</a>), and flatters himself that he is quite able without it to give a satisfactory account of any question presented to him. <span class="cmt_word">Than seven men that can render a reason.</span> "Seven" is the number of completeness (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). The idle fool sets more value by his own judgment than by the sense of any number of wise men. Revised Version margin, "that can answer discreetly," is perhaps nearer the Hebrew, which implies the being able to return a wise and proper answer to anything asked of them. The LXX. reading a little differently, renders, "Wiser seems a  sluggard to himself than one who in satiety (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>) brings back a message." This is explained to mean that a sluggard thinks himself wise in not helping a neighbour with an errand or a message, though he would have probably been repaid with a good dinner for his kindness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17</a></div><div class="verse">He that passeth by, <i>and</i> meddleth with strife <i>belonging</i> not to him, <i>is like</i> one that taketh a dog by the ears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-28.</span> - A series of proverbs connected more or less with peacefulness and its opposite. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him.</span> "Meddleth with strife" should be "vexes, excites himself, with a quarrel." Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears, and thus needlessly provokes him to bark and bite. Regarding the position of the two participles in this verse, without any connecting link, Delitzsch takes "passing by" as attributed to the dog, thus: "He seizes by the ears a dog passing by, who is excited by a strife that concerns him not." The stray dog corresponds to the quarrel with which one has nothing to do. The present accentuation does not support this view; otherwise it is suitable and probable. Septuagint, "As he who lays hold of a dog's tail, so is he who sets himself forth as champion in another's cause." Ecclus. 11:9, "Strive not in a matter that concerns thee not."

"Firebrands" are darts with some blazing material attached to them. "Death "forms a climax with the other dangers mentioned, which the madman deals forth recklessly and indiscriminately. <span class="cmt_word">So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</span> When a man has injured his neighbour by lies or malice, the plea that he was only in joke is not allowed; the injury is not less real because he excuses it by alleging it was done not seriously, but playfully; no more than the fatal effects of the use of murderous weapons are lessened by their being employed by the hands of a maniac. Practical joking is often a most serious matter. A mediaeval adage says wisely - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Cum jocus est verus, jocus est malus atque severus,"</span> Septuagint, "Even as those who are under medical treatment (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) throw words at men, and he who first meets the word will be overthrown; so are all they that lay wait for their own friends, and when they are seen, say, I did it in jest." As insane persons who abuse and ill treat their physicians are excused by reason of their infirmity, so those who injure friends in secret try to excuse themselves when found out by alleging that they were only joking.

Thus lips that seem to burn with affection, and give the kiss of glowing, love, may mask a heart filled with envy and hatred Judas kisses and words of friendship hide the bad feelings that lurk within. Septuagint, "Silver given with guile is to be considered as a potsherd; smooth (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) lips hide a grievous heart" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>).
