Others translate, "godless hope," or "expectation that bringeth grief," or "strong, self-confident men;" "men in the fulness of their vigour." But the rendering of the Authorized Version is well supported, and the two clauses are coordinate. The Septuagint, in order to accentuate the implied antithesis, has seemingly altered the text, and introduced a thought which favours the immortality of the soul, "When a righteous man dieth, hope perisheth not; but the boast of the wicked perisheth" (Wisd. 3:18). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/11-8.htm">Proverbs 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of trouble;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God is at hand to help the righteous out of straits (<span class="accented">de angustia</span>, Vulgate); or takes him away from the evil to come (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>; Wisd. 4:10-14).

The evil from which the righteous is saved fails upon the wicked. As Abraham says to Dives in the parable, "He is comforted, but thou art tormented" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>). Of this substitution many instances occur in Scripture. Thus Haman was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai (<a href="../../par/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>); Daniel's accusers were cast into the den of lions from which he was saved (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>).

Septuagint, "In the mouth of the wicked is a snare for fellow citizens." Through knowledge. By the knowledge which the just possess, and which they display by judicious counsel, peace and safety are secured.

Ewald would argue that such language could not be used of the capital of the Jews till the times of Asa or Jehoshaphat. But what is to prevent the sentence being taken generally of any city or community? The Vatican manuscript of the Septuagint and some others give here only the first clause, "In the prosperity of the righteous the city succeeds," adding from ver. 11, "but by the mouths of the wicked it is overthrown" (see on ver. 4; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>, etc.).

This would go to prove the superiority of a popular government over the despotism of a single ruler. But the caution of our homely proverb is net inopportune, "Too many cooks spoil the broth." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a></div><div class="verse">He that is surety for a stranger shall smart <i>for it</i>: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is surety for a stranger;</span> or, <span class="accented">for another</span> (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall smart</span> for it.

Vulgate, "who is cautious of snares," especially of the insidious dangers that lurk in suretyship. <span class="cmt_word">Is sure;</span> is at rest and has nothing to fear. There is no paronomasia in the Hebrew. The play on "suretyship" and "sure" in the Authorized Version is either accidental or was introduced with the idea of giving point to the sentence. The Septuagint translates differently, "A wicked man doeth evil when he mixes with the righteous; he hateth the sound of safety (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." This perhaps means that the fraudulent creditor deceives the good man who has stood security for him; and henceforward the good man cannot bear to hear immunity and safety spoken of (see note on Proverbs 20:16). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/11-16.htm">Proverbs 11:16</a></div><div class="verse">A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong <i>men</i> retain riches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A gracious woman;</span> a woman full of grace.

The two clauses are parallel in form, not in sense, and imply that beauty is more effective than strength, and honour is better than wealth. The Septuagint takes a narrow view: "A graceful woman bringeth glory to her husband." The last clause is rendered, "The manly (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are supported by wealth." Between the two clauses the LXX. and the Syriac introduce the following paragraphs: "But a seat of dishonour is a woman that hateth righteousness. The indolent come to want wealth, but the manly," etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a></div><div class="verse">The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but <i>he that is</i> cruel troubleth his own flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The merciful man;</span> the kind, loving man.

"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>) <span class="cmt_word">Troubleth his own flesh;</span> brings retribution on himself. Some commentators, comparing Ecclus. 14:5 ("He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?"), translate, "He who does good to himself is a kind man to others, and he who troubles his own body will be cruel to others." The sentiment is quite untrue. Self-indulgence does not lead to regard for others; and a severe, ascetic life, while it encourages stern views of human weaknesses, does not make a man cruel and uncharitable. The Vulgate takes "his own flesh" to mean "his neighbours," as Judah calls his brother Joseph "our flesh" (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27</a>). But the parallelism confirms the Authorized Version. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a></div><div class="verse">The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness <i>shall be</i> a sure reward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A deceitful work;</span> work that brings no reward or profit, belying hope, like "fundus mendax" of Horace, 'Od.,' 3:1, 30. The Septuagint has, "unrighteous works," which seems a jejune rendering, and does not bring out the contrast of the <span class="cmt_word">sure reward</span> in the second member (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To him that soweth righteousness</span> (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8, 9</a>). To "sow righteousness" is to act righteously, to live in such a way that the result is holiness. The "reward," in a Jew's eyes, would be a long life in which to enjoy the fruits of his good conduct. We Christians have a better hope, which is, perhaps, adumbrated by this analogy: as the seed sown in the field does not produce its fruit till the time of harvest, so righteousness meets with its full recompense only in the great harvest at the end of all things. The Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">The wicked earnnth deceitful wages</span>: <span class="accented">but he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.</span> This makes a good antithesis. The  Septuagint renders the last clause, "but the seed of the righteous is a true reward (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)."

The Authorized Version takes it for "as;" the Revised Version as an adjective: <span class="accented">He that is steadfast</span> <span class="accented">in righteousness.</span> It is, perhaps, better, with Nowack, to regard it as an adverb: "He who is honestly, strictly, of righteousness, is to life." The meaning is plain: real, genuine righteousness hath the promise of this life and of that which is to come (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ben</span>), translate, "A righteous son is born for life." <span class="cmt_word">He that pursueth evil</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>); Septuagint, "the persecution of the impious," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that which an impious man inflicts. But the Authorized Version is correct, and the clause means that he who practises evil brings ruin eventually on himself - a warning trite, but unheeded (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>).

The Septuagint and some other versions take the phrase in the sense of unjust violence: "He who layeth hand upon hand unjustly;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">manus in manu</span>, "hand in hand," which is as enigmatical as the Hebrew. Some Jewish interpreters consider it an adverbial expression, signifying simply "soon." Some moderns take it to mean "sooner or later," as the Italian <span class="accented">da</span> <span class="accented">mano in mano</span>, or, in succession of one generation after another (Gesenius, Wordsworth). Others deem it a form of adjuration, equivalent to "I hereby attest, my hand upon it!" And this seems the most probable interpretation; assuredly the Divine justice shall be satisfied by the punishment of the wicked (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>.). The Authorized Version gives a very good sense: "Though hands be plighted in faith, and men may associate together in evil, the wicked shall not go unpunished" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job,' lib. 25.) takes a very different view: "Hand in hand the wicked shall not be innocent;" for hand is wont to he joined with hand when it rests at ease, and no laborious employment exercises it. As though he were saying, "Even when the hand rests from sinful deeds, yet the wicked, by reason of his thoughts, is not innocent" (Oxford transl.). This exposition is, of course, divorced from the context. <span class="cmt_word">The seed of the righteous.</span> This is not "the posterity of the righteous," but is a periphrasis for "the righteous," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, "the generation of the righteous" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>). The climax which some see here - as if the author intended to say, "Not only the good themselves, but their descendants also shall be delivered" - is non-existent and unnecessary. Septuagint, "But he that soweth righteousness shall receive a sure reward," which is another rendering of the second member of ver. 18. <span class="cmt_word">Shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be delivered</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the time of God's wrath (vers. 4, 23; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-22.htm">Proverbs 2:22</a>).

The external beauty of such a woman is as incongruous as a precious ring in the snout of a pig. Lesetre quotes an Arab proverb: "A woman without modesty is food without salt." Whether swine in Eastern countries were "ringed," as they are with us nowadays, is unknown; if they were thus treated, the proverb is still more vivid.

Other commentators, ancient and modern, take the clause to imply that the wishes of evil men, animated by wrath and ill temper, are only satisfied by inflicting injuries on others. Delitzsch would translate <span class="accented">ebrah</span>, "excess," "presumption," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>. But the first interpretation seems most suitable (scrap. <a href="../../par/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8, 9</a>). The LXX., pointing differently, for "wrath" reads "shall perish."

Nutt quotes the old epitaph, "What we spent, we had; what we saved, we lost; what we gave, we have."

That which is thus withheld is no real benefit to him. it only inure, sos his want.

Dionysius Cato, 'Distich. de Mor.,' 54:4, 1 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Despice divitias, si vis animo esse beatus,<br />Quas qui suscipiunt mendicant semper avari."</span>

Septuagint, "Every simple soul is blessed." <span class="cmt_word">He that watereth</span> - benefits and refreshes others - <span class="cmt_word">shall be watered also himself;</span> shall receive the blessing which he imparts. The Vulgate introduces another idea, <span class="accented">Qui inebriat, ipse quoque inebriabitur</span>, where the verb implies rather abundance than excess, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a>, etc. The Septuagint departs widely from the present text: "A passionate man is not graceful" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is ugly in appearance and manner - a sentiment which may be very true, but it is not clear how it found its way into the passage. St. Chrysostom comments upon it in 'Hom.' 17, on St. John. There are some Eastern proverbs on the stewardship of the rich. When a good man gets riches, it is like fruit falling into the midst of the village. The riches of the good are like water turned into a rice field. The good, like clouds, receive only to give away. The rivers themselves drink not their water; nor do the trees eat their own sweet fruit, and the clouds eat not the crops. The garment in which you clothe another will last longer than that in which you clothe yourself. Who gives alms sows one and reaps a thousand.

The avaricious have always been found ready to buy corn and other necessary articles of consumption when plentiful, and wait till there was dearth in the market or scarcity in the land, and then sell them at famine prices. Amos sternly reproves this iniquity (<a href="../../par/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4</a>, etc.).

Such selfishness has often given rise to tumult and bloodshed, and has been punished in a signal manner. The legend of Bishop Hatto shows the popular feeling concerning these Dardanarians, as they were called by Ulpian ('Digest. Justin.,' 47:11.6). Such a one St. Chrysostom ('Hom. in 1 Cor.,' 39) calls "a common enemy of the blessings of the world, and a foe to the liberality of the Lord of the world, and a friend of mammon, or rather his slave." The Septuagint gives a curious rendering: "He who hohleth corn may he leave it for the peoples!" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> may neither he nor his heirs be benefited by his store, but may it be distributed among others far and near! <span class="cmt_word">That selleth it;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that breaketh it</span>, as it is said of Joseph when he sold corn to the Egyptians (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>).

The other side of the question is given by the Son of Sirach: "Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service" (Ecclus. 10:25).

He who gives men of the tree of life attracts souls to himself, to listen to his teaching and to follow his example.

The Septuagint introduces an antithesis not found in our Hebrew text: "But the souls of transgressors are taken untimely away." Ewald and others change the present order of clauses in vers. 29 and 30, thinking thus to improve the parallelism. They would rearrange the passage in the following way: "He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; but the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart; but he that is wise winneth souls." There is no authority whatever in the versions or older commentators for this alteration; and the existing arrangement, as we have shown, gives a very good sense.
