SECOND GREAT COLLECTION OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS, gathered by "the men of Hezekiah," in which wisdom is set forth as the greatest blessing to the king and his subjects. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">superscription: <span class="cmt_word"></span>These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah King of Judah copied out.</span> The word "also" implies that a previous collection was known to the compiler of the present book - probably the one which we have in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10.htm">Proverbs 10-22:16</a>, of which nine proverbs are inserted here. But there was still a large number of proverbial sayings attributed to Solomon, and preserved partly by oral tradition and partly in writing, which it was advisable to collect and secure before they were lost. The zeal of Hezekiah took this in hand. He was not, as far as we know, an author himself, but he evidently felt a warm interest in literature, and "the men of Hezekiah," not mentioned elsewhere, must have been his counsellors and scholars, to whom was entrusted the duty of gathering together into a volume the scattered sayings of the wise king. Among those contemporaries, doubtless, Isaiah was eminent, and it is not improbable that Shebna the scribe and Josh the chronicler were members of the learned fraternity (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>). The verb rightly translated "copied out" (<span class="accented">athak</span>) means, properly, "to remove," "to transfer" from one place to another (<span class="accented">transtulerunt</span>, Vulgate); hence it signifies here to copy into a book words taken from other writings or people's mouths. The sayings thus collected, whether truly Solomon's or not, were extant under his name, and were regarded as worthy of his reputation for wisdom. The title is given in the Septuagint, thus: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is uncertain. It has been translated "impossible to distinguish," equivalent to "miscellaneous;" "beyond doubt," equivalent to "genuine," "hard to interpret," as in Polyb., 15:12, 9. St. James (<a href="../../par/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>) applies the term to wisdom, but the interpreters there are not agreed as to the meaning, it being rendered "without partiality," "without variance," "without doubtfulness," etc. It seems best to take the word as used by the LXX. to signify "mixed," or "miscellaneous." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <i>is</i> to search out a matter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-7.</span> - Proverbs concerning kings. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.</span> That which is the chief glory of God is his mysteriousness, the unfathomable character of his nature and attributes and doings. The more we search into these matters, the more complete we find our ignorance to be; finite faculties are utterly unable to comprehend the infinite; they can embrace merely what God chooses to reveal. "Secret things belong unto the Lord our God" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>), and the great prophet, favoured with Divine revelations, can only confess, "Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself" <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>; comp <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">But the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</span> The same word is used for "glory" and "honour" in both clauses, and ought to have been rendered similarly. It is the king's glory to execute justice and to defend the rights and safety of his people. To do this effectually he must investigate matters brought before him, look keenly into political difficulties, get to the bottom of all  complications, and watch against possible dangers. The contrast between the glory of God and that of the king lies in this - that whereas both God and the king desire man's welfare, the former promotes this by making him feel his ignorance and littleness and entire dependence upon this mysterious Being whose nature and designs mortals cannot understand; the latter advances the good of his subjects by giving them confidence in his zeal and power to discover truth, and using his knowledge for their benefit. Septuagint, "The glory of God concealeth a word (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>): but the glory of a king honoureth matters (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-3.htm">Proverbs 25:3</a></div><div class="verse">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <i>is</i> unsearchable.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - This proverb is connected with the preceding by the idea of "searching" (<span class="accented">chakar</span>) common to both. Such emblematic proverbs are common in this second collection (see Ver. 11). Three subjects are stated, of which is predicated the term unsearchable, viz. <span class="cmt_word">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings.</span> As you can never rise to the illimitable height of the heavens, as you can never penetrate to the immeasurable depth of the earth, so you can never fathom the heart of a king, can never find out what he really thinks and intends (comp. <a href="../../par/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>). It may be that tacitly a warning is intended against flattering one's sell that one knows and can reckon on the favour of a king; his good disposition towards you may be only seeming, or may any moment become changed. The Septuagint has for "unsearchable" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "unquestionable." The commentators refer to a passage in Tacitus ('Ann.' 6:8), where M. Terentius defends himself for being a friend of Sejanus by the fact of the impossibility of investigating a great man's real sentiments. "To us," he says to Tiberius, "it appertains not to judge whom you exalt above all others and for what reason you do so. Facts which are obvious we all notice. We see who is the man upon whom you heap wealth and honours, who it is that has the chief power of dispensing rewards and punishments; that these were possessed by Sejanus no one can deny. But to pry into the hidden thoughts of a prince, and the designs which he meditates in secret, is unlawful and hazardous; nor would the attempt succeed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - A tetrastich in an emblematical form. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take away the dross from the silver</span>. Silver was most extensively used by the Hebrews (see 'Dictionary of the Bible,' <span class="accented">sub voc</span>.), whether obtained from native mines or imported from foreign countries, and the process of separating the ore from the extraneous matters mixed with it was well known (<a href="../../par/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>, etc.; see on Proverbs 17:3). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">there shall come forth a</span> <span class="cmt_word">vessel for the finer</span> (<span class="accented">tsaraph</span>); the goldsmith. The pure silver is ready for the artist s work, who from this material can make a beautiful vessel. Septuagint, "Beat untested silver, and all shall be made entirely pure," where the allusion is to the process of reducing minerals by lamination. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a></div><div class="verse">Take away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take away the wicked from before the king.</span> Let the wicked be removed from the presence of the king, as dross is separated from the pure silver (see the same metaphor, <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Jeremiah 6:29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And his throne shall be established in righteousness</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>: 29:14). The king detects the evil and punishes them; and this confirms his rule and secures the continuance of his dynasty. Thus righteousness triumphs, and wickedness is properly dealt with. Septuagint, "Slay the ungodly from the face of the king, and his throne shall prosper in righteousness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-6.htm">Proverbs 25:6</a></div><div class="verse">Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <i>men</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - Another proverb (a pentastich) connected with kings and great men. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king.</span> Do not make display of yourself as though vying with the king in outward circumstances. Septuagint, "Boast not thyself (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the presence of a king." <span class="cmt_word">Stand not in the place of great men.</span> Do not pretend to be the equal of those who occupy high places in the kingdom (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>). Septuagint, "And take not your stand (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;</span>) in the places of chieftains." Says a Latin gnome, "Qui cum fortuna convenit, dives est;" and Ovid wrote well ('Trist.,' 3:4. 25, etc.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Crede mihi; bene qui latuit, bene vixit; et intra<br />Fortunam debet quisque manere suam...<br />Tu quoque formida nimium sublimia semper;<br />Propositique memor contrahe vela tui."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-7.htm">Proverbs 25:7</a></div><div class="verse">For better <i>it is</i> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither.</span> It is better for the prince to select you for elevation to a high post; to call you up near his throne. The reference is not necessarily to position at a royal banquet, though the maxim lends itself readily to such application. This warbling against arrogance and presumption was used by our blessed Lord in enforcing a lesson of humility and self-discipline (<a href="../../par/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>, etc ). Septuagint, "For it is better for thee that it should be said, Come up unto me (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>)" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</span> The last words have been variously interpreted:  "to whom thou hast come with a request for preferment;" "into whose august presence thou hast been admitted, so as to see his face" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>); "who knows all about thee, and will thus make thee feel thy humiliation all the more." But <span class="accented">nadib</span>, rendered "prince," is not the king, but any noble or great man; and what the maxim means is this - that it is wise to save yourself from the mortification of being turned out of a place which you have knowingly usurped. Your own eyes see that he is in the company; you are aware of what is his proper position; you have occupied a post which belongs to another; justly you are removed, and all present witness your humiliation. The moralist knew that the bad spirit of pride was fostered and encouraged by every act of self-assertion; hence the importance of his warning. The Septuagint makes a separate sentence of these last words, "Speak thou of what thine eyes saw," or, perhaps, like St. Jerome, the Syriac, and Symmachus, attach them to the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-8.htm">Proverbs 25:8</a></div><div class="verse">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <i>thou know not</i> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - A tristich with no parallelism. <span class="cmt_word">Go not forth hastily to strive.</span> The idea is either of one entering into litigation with undue haste, or of one hurrying to meet an adversary. St. Jerome, taking in the final words of the previous verse, renders, <span class="accented">Quae viderunt oculi tui</span>, <span class="accented">ne proferas in jurgio cito</span>, "What thine eyes have seen reveal not hastily in a quarrel." This is like Ver. 9 below, and Christ's injunction, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone" (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof.</span> The Hebrew is elliptical, "Lest by chance (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) thou do something (bad, humiliating) in the end thereof." But Delitzsch, Nowack, and others consider the sentence as interrogative (as <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a>), and translate, "That it may not be said in the end thereof, What wilt thou do?" Either way, the warning comes to this - Do not enter hastily upon strife of any kind, lest thou be utterly at a loss what to do. When thy neighbour hath put thee to shame, by putting thee in the wrong, gaining his cause, or getting the victory over thee in some way. Septuagint, "Fall not quickly into a contest, lest thou repent at the last." There is an English proverb, "Anger begins with folly and ends with repentance;" and "Haste is the beginning of wrath, its end is repentance." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-9.htm">Proverbs 25:9</a></div><div class="verse">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <i>himself</i>; and discover not a secret to another:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - A tetrastich without parallelism, connected with the preceding maxim. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>; see on ver. 8). If you have any quarrel with a neighbour, or are drawn into a controversy with him, deal with him privately in a friendly manner. <span class="cmt_word">And discover not a secret to another;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the secret of another</span>. Do not bring in a third party, or make use of anything entrusted to you by another person, or of which you have become privately informed, in order to support your cause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-10.htm">Proverbs 25:10</a></div><div class="verse">Lest he that heareth <i>it</i> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest he that heareth it</span> <span class="cmt_word">put thee to shame;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. lest any one, not the offended neighbour only, who hears how treacherous you have been, makes your proceeding known and cries shame upon you. <span class="cmt_word">And thine infamy turn not away.</span> The stigma attached to you be never obliterated. Thus Siracides: "Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbour" (Ecclus. 27:16, etc.; comp. also 22:22). The motive presented in our text is not the highest, being grounded on the fear of shame and disgrace in men's eyes; but it is a very potent incentive to right action, and the moralist has good reason for employing it. That it does not reach to the height of Christian morality is obvious. The gnome is thus given in the Greek: "When thy friend shall reproach thee, retreat backward, despise him not, lest thy friend reproach thee still; and so thy quarrel and enmity shall not pass away, but shall be to thee like death." Then the LXX. adds a paragraph, reproduced partly by St. Jerome, "Kindness and friendship set a man free (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>); preserve thou these, that thou become not liable to reproach (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">exprobabilis</span>); but guard thy ways in a conciliating spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)."

In the latter case the phrase may mean a word quickly formed, or moving easily, spoken <span class="accented">ore rotundo</span>, or a speedy answer. But the metaphor is unusual and inappropriate; and it is best to understand a word spoken under due consideration of time and place. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui loquitur verbum in tempore suo</span>; Aquila and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "in circumstances that suit it;" the Septuagint has simply <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. Is like <span class="cmt_word">apples of gold in pictures of silver.</span> In these emblematical distichs the words, "is like," in the Authorized Version, are an insertion. The Hebrew places the two ideas merely in sequence; the object with which some, thing is compared usually coming before, that which is compared with it, as here, "Apples of gold - a word fitly spoken" (so  in vers. 14, 18, 19, 26, 28). There is a doubt about the meaning of the word rendered "pictures," <span class="accented">maskith</span> (see on Proverbs 18:11). It seems to be used generally in the sense of "image," "sculpture," being derived from the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to see;" from this it comes to signify "ornament," and here most appropriately is "basket," and, as some understand, of filagree work. St. Jerome mistakes the word, rendering, <span class="accented">in lectis argenteis</span>. The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "on a necklace of sardius." "Apples of gold" are apples or other fruits of a golden colour, not made of gold, which would be very costly and heavy; nor would the comparison with artificial fruits be as suitable as that with natural. The "word" is the fruit set off by its circumstances, as the latter's beauty is enhanced by the grace of the vessel which contains it. The "apple" has been supposed to be the orange (called in late Latin <span class="accented">pomum aurantium</span>) or the citron. We may cite here the opinion of a competent traveller: "For my own part," says Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 605), "I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that the <span class="accented">apricot</span> alone is the 'apple' of Scripture Everywhere the apricot is common; perhaps it is, with the single exception of the fig, the most abundant fruit of the country. In highlands and lowlands alike, by the shores of the Mediterranean and on the banks of the Jordan, in the nooks of Judea, under the heights of Lebanon, in the recesses of Galilee, and in the glades of Gilead, the apricot flourishes, and yields a crop of prodiscus abundance. Its characteristics meet every condition of the 'tappuach' of Scripture. 'I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste' (<a href="../../par/songs/2-3.htm">Song of Solomon 2:3</a>). Near Damascus, and on the banks of the Barada, we have pitched our tents under its shade, and spread our carpets secure from the rays of the sun. 'The smell of thy nose (shall be) like tappuach' (<a href="../../par/songs/7-8.htm">Song of Solomon 7:8</a>). There can scarcely be a more deliciously perfumed fruit than the apricot; and what fruit can better fit the epithet of Solomon, 'apples of <span class="accented">gold</span> in pictures of silver,' than this golden fruit, as its branches bend under the weight in their setting of bright yet pale foliage?" Imagery similar to that found in this verse occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-20.htm">Proverbs 18:20</a>.

The two, whether worn by one person or more, form a lovely combination, and set off the wearer's grace and beauty. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Inauris aurea et margaritum fulgens</span>, "A golden earring and a brilliant pearl." Septuagint, "A golden earring a precious sardius also is set." So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. The obedient ear receives the precepts of the wise reprover, and wears them as a valued ornament. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> the instruction of parents is compared to a chaplet on the head and a fair chain on the neck. Septuagint, "A wise word on an obedient ear."

This luxury was not unknown in the time of Solomon, who had a summer palace on Lebanon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>), though it could have been enjoyed by very few, and would not speak to the personal experience of the burgher class, to whom the proverbs seem to have been addressed. Xenophon writes of the use of snow to cool wine ('Memorab.,' 2:1. 30). Hitzig quotes a passage from the old history of the Crusades, called 'Gesta Dei per Francos,' which runs thus: "Nix frigidissima a monte Libano defertur, ut vino commixta, tanquam glaciem ipsum frigidum reddat." So in the present day snow is sold in Damascus bazaars. The LXX., not realizing what harm such an untimely storm might effect, translates, "As a fall (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of snow in harvest is of use against heat, so a faithful messenger benefits those who sent him." So is a faithful messenger to them that send him. (For "faithful messenger," see on Proverbs 13:17; and for "them that send," see on Proverbs 22:21.) The comparison is explained. <span class="cmt_word">For he refresheth the soul of his masters.</span> He brings as great refreshment to his masters' mind as would a drink of snow-cooled water in the burning harvest field. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-14.htm">Proverbs 25:14</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <i>is like</i> clouds and wind without rain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The Hebrew is, <span class="cmt_word">Clouds and wind without rain - he that boasteth himself in a gift of falsehood</span> (see on Ver. 11). The proverb is concerned with promises disappointed. Clouds and wind are generally in the East the precursors of heavy rain, as we read in <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>, "In a little while the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain." After  such phenomena, which, according to current meteorological observation, gave every hope of a refreshing shower in the time of summer drought, to see the clouds pass away without affording a single drop of rain is a grievous disappointment. The metaphor is found in the New Testament. St. Jude (Ver. 12) calls false teachers "clouds without water, carried along by winds." "A gift of falsehood," equivalent to "a false gift," one that deceives, because it is only promised and never given. A man makes a great parade of going to bestow a handsome present, and then sneaks out of it, and gives nothing. Such a one is, as St. Jerome renders, <span class="accented">Vir gloriosus</span>, <span class="accented">et promissa non complens</span>.

Concerning the folly of making stupid boasts, the Bengalee proverb speaks of a pedlar in ginger getting tidings of his ship. The Septuagint is incorrect, "As winds, and clouds, and rains are most evident (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), so is he who boasts of a false gift."

Such a bearing presupposes innocence and weighs favourably with the judge.

"Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed saepe cadendo." Similar proverbs are found elsewhere, though probably in a different sense. Thus in modern Greek, "The tongue has no bones, yet it breaks bones;" in Turkish, "The tongue has no bone, yet it crushes;" again, "One drop of honey," says the Turk, "catches more bees than a ton of vinegar."

The mind may be overloaded as well as the body: only such instruction as can be digested and assimilated is serviceable to the spiritual nature; injudicious cramming produces satiety and disgust. Again, "To 'find honey,'" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 16:8), "is to taste the sweetness of holy intelligence, which is eaten enough of then when our perception, according to the measure of our faculty, is held tight under control. For he is 'filled with honey, and vomits it' who, in seeking to dive deeper than he has capacity for, loses that too from whence he might have derived nourishment." And in another place (ibid., 20:18), "The sweetness of spiritual meaning he who seeks to eat beyond what he contains, even what he had eaten he 'vomiteth;' because, whilst he seeks to make out things above, beyond his powers, even the things that he had made out aright, he forfeits" (Oxford transl.).

Do not pay too frequent visits  to your neighbors' house, or make yourself too much at home there. The Son of Sirach has an utterance on a somewhat similar subject, "Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-20.htm">Proverbs 25:20</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, <i>and as</i> vinegar upon nitre, so <i>is</i> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather.</span> The proverb gives three instances of what is wrong, incongruous, or unwise, the first two leading up to the third, which is the pith of the maxim. But them is some doubt about the rendering of the first clause. The Authorized Version has the authority of the Syriac, Aquila, and others, and gives an appropriate sense, the unreasonable proceeding being the laying aside of some of one's own clothes in cold weather. But the verb here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">adah</span>), may also mean "to adorn," <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, with fine garments; hence some expositors understand the incongruity to be the dressing one's self in gay apparel in winter. But, as Delitzsch remarks, there is no reason why fine clothes should not be warm; and if they are so, there is nothing unreasonable in wearing them. The rendering of our version is probably correct. St. Jerome annexes this line to the preceding verse, as if it confirmed the previous instances of misplaced confidence, <span class="accented">Et amittit pallium in die frigoris</span>. "Such a one loses his cloak in a day of frost." <span class="cmt_word">Vinegar upon nitre.</span> Our nitre, or saltpetre, is nitrate of potash, which is not the substance intended by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nether</span>). The substance signified by this term is a natural alkali, known to the ancients as natron, and composed of carbonate of soda with some other admixture. It was used extensively for washing purposes, and in cookery and bread making. It effervesces with an acid, such as vinegar, and changes its character, becoming a salt, and being rendered useless for all the purposes to which it was applied in its alkaline condition. So he who pours vinegar on natron does a foolish thing, for he spoils a highly useful article, and produces one which is of no service to him. Septuagint, "As vinegar is inexpedient for a wound (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), so suffering falling on the body pains the heart." Schulteus, Ewald, and others, by referring <span class="accented">nether</span> to an Arabic source, obtain the meaning "wound," or "sore," titus: "As vinegar on a sore." This gives a most appropriate sense, and might well be adopted if it had sufficient authority. But this is doubtful. Cornelius a Lapide translates the Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f6d;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Sicut acetum trahit inutile;" and explains that vinegar draws from the soil the nitre which is prejudicial to vegetation, and thus renders ground fertile - a fact in agricultural chemistry not generally known, though Columella vouches for it. A somewhat similar fact, however, is of common experience. Land occasionally becomes what farmers term "sour," and is thus sterile; if it is then dressed with salt. its fertillity is restored. So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. The inconsistency lies in thinking to cheer a sorrowful heart by singing merry songs. "A tale out of season," says Siracides, "is as music in mourning" (Ecclus. 22:6). The Greeks denoted cruel incongruity by the proverb, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; "Ludere inter maerentes." As the old hymn says -  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Strains of gladness<br />Suit not souls with anguish torn."</span> The true Christian sympathy teaches to "rejoice with them that rejoice, to weep with them that weep" (<a href="../../par/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). Plumptre, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' suggests that the effervescence caused by the mixture of acid and alkali is taken as a type of the irritation produced by the inopportune songs. But this is importing a modern view into a paragraph, such as would never have occurred to the writer. The Septuagint, followed partially by Jerome, the Syriac, and the Targum, introduces another proverb not found in the Hebrew, "As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the sorrow of a man hurts his heart." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a></div><div class="verse">If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - This famous tetrastrich is reproduced (with the exception of the fourth line) from the Septuagint by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The traditional hatred of enemies is here strongly repudiated (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17, 18</a>, and notes there). Thus Elisha treated the Syrians, introduced blindly into the midst of Samaria, ordering the King of Israel to set bread and water before them, and to send them away unharmed (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-22.htm">2 Kings 6:22</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a></div><div class="verse">For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</span> This expression has been taken in various senses. It has been thought to mean that the forgiveness of the injured person brings to the cheek of the offender the burning blush of shame. But heaping coals on the head cannot naturally be taken to express such an idea. St. Chrysostom and other Fathers consider that Divine vengeance is implied, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, "Upon the wicked he shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be their portion;" and <a href="../../par/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>, "Let burning coals fall upon them." Of course, in one view, kindness to an evil man only gives him occasion for fresh ingratitude and hatred, and therefore increases God's wrath against him. But it would be a wicked motive to act this beneficent part only to have the satisfaction of seeing your injurer humbled or punished. And the gnome implies that the sinner is benefited by the clemency shown to him, that the requital of evil by good brings the offender to a better mind, and aids his spiritual life. "Coals of fire" are a metaphor for the penetrating pain of remorse and repentance. The unmerited kindness which he receives forces upon him the consciousness of his ill doing, which is accompanied by the sharp rain of regret. St. Augustine, "Ne dubitaveris figurate dictum...ut intelligas carbones ignis esse urentes poenitentiae gemitus, quibus superbia sanatur ejus, qui dolit se inimicum fuisse hominis, a quo ejus miseriae subvenitur" ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 3:16). Lesetre quotes St. Francis de Sales, who gives again a different view, "You are not obliged to seek reconciliation with one who has offended you; it may be rather his part to seek you; yet nevertheless go and follow the Saviour's counsel, prevent him with good, render him good for evil: heap coals of fire on his head and on his heart, which may burn up all ill will and constrain him to love you" ('De l'Am. de Dieu,' 8:9). <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord shall reward thee.</span> This consideration can scarcely be regarded as the chief motive for the liberality enjoined, though it would be present to the kind person's mind, and be a support and comfort to him in a course of conduct repugnant to the natural man. He would remember the glorious reward promised to godliness by the prophet (<a href="../../par/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, etc.), and how Saul had expressed his consciousness of David's magnanimity in sparing his life. "Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil...  wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17, 19</a> and 1 Sam 26:21).

The north wind is called by the natives of Palestine "the heavenly," from the bright effect which it produces in the sky. "By means of the north wind cometh he (the sun) forth as gold" (<a href="../../par/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>). But the verb here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means "to bring forth, produce" (<a href="../../par/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>); hence the Revised Version rightly renders, "The north wind bringeth forth rain." This is quite true if "north wind" be taken as equivalent to "wind from the dark quarter" (Umbreit), like <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in Greek; and, in fact, the northwest wind in Palestine does bring rain. Septuagint, "The north wind arouseth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) clouds." <span class="cmt_word">So doth an angry countenance a backbiting, tongue.</span> Carrying on the interpretation intended by the Authorized Version, this clause means that an angry leer will check a slanderer and incline him to hold his peace from prudential motives. But with the rendering given above, "bringeth forth," another explanation is involved, viz. "So does a secret, slandering tongue cause a troubled countenance." When a man discovers that a secret slanderer is working against him, he shows it by his gloomy and angry look, as the sky is dark  with clouds when a storm is threatened. "Countenance" is plural in the Hebrew, denoting, as Hitzig points out, that the calumniator does not affect one person only, but occasions trouble far and wide, destroys friendly relations between many, excites suspicion and enmity in various quarters Septuagint, "An impudent countenance provokes the tongue."

The relief to the latter, when they receive good news of the wanderer, is as refreshing as a draught of cool water to a fainting, weary man. We do not know that the Hebrews were great travellers in those days; but any communication from a distant country would be very uncertain in arriving at its destination, and would at any rate take a long time in transmission, in most cases there would be nothing to rest upon but vague report, or a message carried by some travelling merchant. There is a somewhat similar proverb found at Ver. 13 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>. The ancient commentators have seen in this news from a distant country the announcement of Christ's birth by the angels at Bethlehem, or the preaching of the gospel that tells of the joys of heaven, the land that is very far off (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-26.htm">Proverbs 25:26</a></div><div class="verse">A righteous man falling down before the wicked <i>is as</i> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Hebrew (see on Ver. 11), <span class="cmt_word">A troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring - a righteous man giving way to the wicked.</span> A good man neglecting to assert himself and to hold his own m the face of sinners, is as useless to society and as harmful to the good cause as a spring that has been defiled by mud stirred up or extraneous matter introduced is unserviceable for drinking and prejudicial to those who use it. The mouth of the righteous should be "a well of life" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>), wholesome, refreshing, helpful; his conduct should be consistent and straightforward, fearless in upholding the right (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, etc.), uncompromising in opposing sin. When such a man, for fear, or favour, or weakness, or weariness, yields to the wicked, compromises principle, no longer makes a stand for truth and purity and virtue, he loses his high character, brings a scandal on religion, and lowers his own spiritual nature. It is this moral cowardice which Christ so sternly rebukes (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-33.htm">Matthew 10:33</a>), "Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven." Some have assumed that the gnome is concerned with a good man's fall into misfortune owing to the machinations of sinners; but in this case the comparison loses its force; such persecution would not disturb the purity or lower the character of the righteous man; it would rather enhance his good qualities, give occasion for their exercise and development, and therefore could not be described as fouling a pure spring. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-27.htm">Proverbs 25:27</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> not good to eat much honey: so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory <i>is not</i> glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is not good to eat much honey</span>. The ill effects of a surfeit of honey have been already mentioned (Ver. 16); but here the application is different, and occasions some difficulty. The Authorized Version, in order to clear up the obscurity of the text, inserts a negative, <span class="cmt_word">So for men to search their own glory is not glory,</span> which seems to be a warning against conceit and self-adulation. This is hardly warranted by the present Hebrew text, which is literally, as Venetian renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, "The search of their glory [is] glory." But who are meant by "their"? No persons are mentioned in the verse to whom the suffix in <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> can be referred, and it is not improbable that some words have dropped out of the text. At the same time, we might naturally in thought supply "for men" after "it is not good," such omissions being not uncommon in proverbial sayings; the suffix then would refer to them. Commentators have endeavoured to amend the text by alterations which do not commend themselves. Schultens supposes that the suffix had reference to the Divine law and revelations, and, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> may mean both "glory" and "weight," translates, "Vestigatio gravitatis eorum, gravitas." Bertheau takes <span class="accented">kabod</span> in two different senses, "The searching out of their glory is a burden." So Delitzsch, by little manipulation of the pointing (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) obtains the rendering, "But to search out hard things is an honour." Taken thus, the maxim says that bodily pleasures sicken and cloy, but diligent study brings honour. This, however, is not satisfactory; it gives a word two different senses in the same clause, and it affords a very feeble contrast. One would naturally expect the proverb to say that the excess, which was deprecated in the first hemistich as regards one department, must be equally rejected in another sphere. This is somewhat the idea given by Jerome, <span class="accented">Sic qui scrutator est majestatis opprimetur a gloria</span>. The truth here stated will be explained by translating our text, "The investigation of weighty matters is a weight." Thus the clauses are shown to be well poised. Honey is good, study is good; but both may be used so as to be prejudicial. Eating may be carried to excess; study may attempt to investigate things too hard or too high. That this is a real danger we know well from the controversies about  predestination and elation in time past, and those concerning spiritualism and theurgy in our own day (see Jeremy Taylor, 'Certainty of Salvation,' 3:176, edit. Hebrews; and 'Holy Living,' ch. 3, &sect; 5). This is the view taken of the passage by St. Gregory ('Moral,' 14:32), 'If the sweetness of honey be taken in greater measure than there is occasion for, from the same source whence the palate is gratified, the life of the eater is destroyed.' The "searching into majesty" is also sweet; but he that seeks to dive into it deeper than the cognizance of human nature admits, finds the mere gloriousness thereof by itself oppresses him, in that, like honey taken in excess, it bursts the sense of the searcher which is not capable of holding it." And again (ibid., 20:18), "For the glory of the invisible Creator, which when searched into with moderation lifts us up, being dived into beyond our powers bears us down" (Oxford transl.). (Comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; Ecclus. 3:21, etc.) Septuagint, "To eat much honey is not good, but it behoves us to honor glorious sayings."

In the Hebrew it runs thus (see on Ver. 11): <span class="cmt_word">A city that is broken down without wall - a man on whose spirit is no restraint</span>. "A city broken down" is explained by the next words. "without wall," and therefore undefended and open to' the first invader (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>). To such a city is compared the man who puts no restraint on his passions, desires, and affections; he is always in danger of being carried away by them and involved in sin and destruction; he has no defence when temptation assaults him, having lost self-control (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>).

"Who can govern himself is fit to govern the world." Septuagint, "As a city whose wails are broken down and which is unwalled, so is a man who does aught without counsel." St. Jerome, by the addition of the words, <span class="accented">in loquendo</span>, applies the proverb to intemperance in language, "So is he who is not able to restrain his spirit in speaking." Commenting on this, St. Gregory ('Moral,' 7:59) says, "Because it is without the wall of silence, the city of the mind lies open to the darts of the enemy, and when it casts itself forth in words, it exhibits itself exposed to the adversary, and he gets the mastery of it without trouble, in proportion as the soul that he has to overcome combats against its own self by much talking" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/24.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 24"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 24" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/26.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 26"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 26" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
