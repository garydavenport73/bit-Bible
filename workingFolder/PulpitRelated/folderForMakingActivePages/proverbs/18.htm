The Authorized Version gives, <span class="cmt_word">Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a man who has an earnest desire for self-improvement will hold himself aloof from worldly entanglements, and, occupying himself wholly in this pursuit, will become conversant with all wisdom. This gives good sense, and offers a contrast to the fool in ver. 2, who "hath no delight in understanding." But the Hebrew does not rightly bear this interpretation. Its conciseness occasions ambiguity. Literally, <span class="accented">For his desire a man who separates himself seeks</span>; <span class="accented">in</span> (or <span class="accented">against</span>)  <span class="accented">all wisdom he mingles himself.</span> There is a doubt whether the life of isolation is praised or censured in this verse. Aben Ezra and others of Pharisaic tendencies adopt the former alternative, and explain pretty much as the Authorized Version, thus: "He who out of love of wisdom divorces himself from home, country, or secular pursuits, such a man will mix with the wise and prudent, and be conversant with such." But the maxim seems rather to blame this separation, though here, again, there is a variety of interpretation. Delitzsch, Ewald, and others translate, "He that dwelleth apart seeketh pleasure, against all sound wisdom he showeth his teeth" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>). Nowack, after Bertheau, renders, "He who separates himself goes after his own desire; with all that is useful he falls into a rage." Thus the maxim is directed against the conceited, self-willed man, who sets himself against public opinion, delights in differing from received customs, takes no counsel from others, thinks nothing of public interests, but in his mean isolation attends only to his own private ends and fancies (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate (followed by Hitzig) read in the first clause, for <span class="accented">taavah</span>, "desire<span class="accented"></span>," <span class="accented">taanah</span>, "occasion;" thus: "He who wishes to separate from a friend seeks occasions; but at all time he will be worthy of censure." The word translated "wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyah</span>) also means "substance," "existence;" hence the rendering, "at all time," <span class="accented">omni existentia</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">omni tempore.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool hath no delight in understanding.</span> This may mean that he takes no pleasure in the wisdom of others, is self-opinionated; or, it may be, does not care for understanding in itself, apart from the use which he can make of it. Vulgate, "The fool receives not the words of wisdom;" Septuagint, "A man of no sense has no need of wisdom." To try to teach a fool is to cast pearls before swine, and to give that which is holy unto dogs. <span class="cmt_word">But that his heart may discover itself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his only delight is in revealing his heart, displaying his un-wisdom and his foolish thoughts, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>. He thinks that thus he is showing himself superior to others, and benefiting the world at large. The LXX. gives the reason, "For rather by folly he is led." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-3.htm">Proverbs 18:3</a></div><div class="verse">When the wicked cometh, <i>then</i> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt.</span> The contempt here spoken of is not that with which the sinner is regarded, but that which he himself learns to feel for all that is pure and good and lovely (<a href="../../par/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>). As the LXX. interprets, "When the wicked cometh into the depth of evil, he despiseth," he turns a despiser. So the Vulgate. Going forward in evil, adding sin to sin, he end by casting all shame aside, deriding the Law Divine and human, and saying in his heart, "There is no God." St. Gregory, "As he who is plunged into a well is confined to the bottom of it; so would the mind fall in, and remain, as it were, at the bottom, if, after having once fallen, it were to confine itself within any measure of sin. But when it cannot be contented with the sin into which it has fallen, while it is daily plunging into worse offences, it finds, as it were, no bottom to the well into which it has fallen, on which to rest. For there would be a bottom to the well, if there were any bounds to his sin. Whence it is well said, 'When a sinner hath come into the lowest depth of sins, he contemneth.' For he puts by returning, because he has no hope that he can be forgiven. But when he sins still more through despair, he withdraws, as it were, the bottom from the well, so as to find therein no resting place" ('Moral.,' 26:69, Oxford transl.). Even the heathen could see this terrible consequence. Thus Juvenal is quoted ('Sat.,' 13:240, etc.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nam quis<br />Peccandi finem posuit sibi? quando receipt<br />Ejectum semel attrita de fronte ruborem?<br />Quisnam hominum est, quem tu contentum videris uno<br />Flagitio?"</span> <span class="cmt_word">And with ignominy cometh reproach.</span> Here again it is not the reproach suffered by the sinner that is meant (as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>), but the abuse which he heaps on others who strive to impede him in his evil courses. All that he says or does brings disgrace, and he is always ready to revue any who are better than himself. Both the Septuagint and the Vulgate make the wicked man the victim instead of the actor, thus: "but upon him there cometh disgrace and reproach." The Hebrew does not well admit this interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-4.htm">Proverbs 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">The words of a man's mouth <i>are as</i> deep waters, <i>and</i> the wellspring of wisdom <i>as</i> a flowing brook.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters.</span> "Man" (<span class="accented">ish</span>) here means the ideal man in all his wisdom and integrity, just as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a> the ideal wife is intended under the general term "wife." Such a man's words are as deep waters which cannot be fathomed or exhausted. The metaphor is common (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-5.htm">Proverbs 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:24</a>; Ecclus. 21:13). For "mouth," the Septuagint reads "heart:" "Deep water is a word in a man's heart." The second hemistich explains the first: <span class="cmt_word">The well spring of wisdom as a flowing</span> (<span class="accented">gushing</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>brook</span>. A man's words are now called a well spring of wisdom, gushing forth from its source, the wise and understanding heart, pure, fresh, and inexhaustible. Septuagint, "And it leapeth  forth (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) a river and a fountain of life." Or we may, with Delitzsch, take the whole as one idea, and consider that a man's words are deep waters, a bubbling brook, and a fountain of wisdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is not good to accept the person of the wicked.</span> To "accept the person" is to show partiality, to be guided in judgment, not by the facts of a case, or the abstract principles of right or wrong, but by extraneous considerations, as a man's appearance, manners, fortune, family. (For the expression, comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-17.htm">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>; and in our book, <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-21.htm">Proverbs 28:21</a>.) The Septuagint phrase is <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which St. Jude adopts (ver. 16). Other writers in the New Testament use <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the same sense; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/luke/20-21.htm">Luke 20:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To overthrow</span> (turn aside) <span class="cmt_word">the righteous in judgment is not good</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>). The construction is the same as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>. The LXX. adds in the second clause, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which makes the sentence clear; not seeing this, the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">ut declines a veritate judicii.</span> The offence censured is the perversion of justice in giving sentence against a righteous man whose cause the judge has reason to know is just.

The foolish man meddles with disputes in which he is not concerned, and by his silly interference not only exposes himself to reprisals, but also exacerbates the original difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">His mouth calleth for strokes.</span> His words provoke severe punishment, "stripes for his back," as it is said in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>. Septuagint, "His mouth which is audacious calls for death." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">A fool's mouth <i>is</i> his destruction, and his lips <i>are</i> the snare of his soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The results of the fool's disposition and actions are further noted. <span class="cmt_word">A fool's mouth is his destruction</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-15.htm">Proverbs 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:12</a>). A mediaeval adage pronounces, "Ex lingua stulta veniunt incommoda multa." <span class="cmt_word">His lips are the snare of his soul;</span> bring his life into danger (see on Proverbs 12:13; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>). So St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/21-35.htm">Luke 21:35</a>) speaks of the last day, coming upon men like "a snare (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>)," the word used by the Septuagint in this passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-8.htm">Proverbs 18:8</a></div><div class="verse">The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of a tale bearer are as wounds.</span> <span class="accented">Nergan</span>, "tale bearer," is better rendered "whisperer" (see on Proverbs 16:28). The Authorized Version reminds one of the mediaeval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Lingua susurronis<br />Est pejor felle draconis."</span> The verse recurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-22.htm">Proverbs 26:22</a>; but the word rendered "wounds" (<span class="accented">mitlahamim</span>) is to be differently explained. It is probably the hithp. participle of <span class="accented">laham</span>," to swallow," and seems to mean "dainty morsels," such as one eagerly swallows. Thus Gesenius, Schultens, Delitzsch, Nowack, and others. So the clause means, "A whisperer's words are received with avidity; calumny, slander, and evil stories find eager listeners." The same metaphor is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>. There may, at the same time, be involved the idea that these dainty morsels are of poisonous character. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Verba bilinguis, quasi simplicia</span>, "The words of a man of double tongue seem to be simple," which contains another truth. <span class="cmt_word">They go down into the innermost parts of the belly</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27, 30</a>). The hearers take in the slanders and treasure them up in memory, to be used as occasion shall offer. The LXX. omits this verse, and in its place introduces a paragraph founded partly on the next verse and partly on <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>. The Vulgate also inserts the interpolation, "Fear overthrows the sluggish; and the souls of the effeminate (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) shall hunger." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-9.htm">Proverbs 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He also that is slothful</span> (<span class="accented">slack</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in his work</span>. A man that does his work in some sort, but not heartily and diligently, as one who knows that labour is not only a duty and necessity, but a means of sanctification, a training for a higher life. <span class="cmt_word">Is brother to him that is a great waster</span>; a destroyer. "Brother" is used as "companion" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>), for one of like attributes and tendencies; as we say, "next door to;" and the destroyer is, as Nowack says, not merely one who wastes his property by reckless expenditure, but one who delights in such destruction, finds a morbid pleasure in haves and ruin. So the maxim asserts that remissness in duty is as mischievous as actual destructiveness. "An idle brain," say the Italians, "is the devil's workshop." The word rendered "great" is <span class="accented">baal</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>), "owner," <span class="accented">patrono</span> (Montanus), <span class="accented">domino</span> (Vatablus); and, taking this sense, according to Wordsworth and others, the sentence implies that the servant who is slothful is brother to a master who is a prodigal. But the interpretation given above is best founded. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;</span> instead of, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;</span>, renders, "He who healeth not (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) himself in his works is brother to him who destroyeth himself."

"Thou hast been a Shelter  for me," says the psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a>), "and a strong Tower from the enemy." The words bring before us a picture of a capitol, or central fortress, in which, at times of danger, the surrounding population could take refuge. Into this Name we Christians are baptized; and trusting in it, and doing the duties to which our profession calls, with faith and prayer, we are safe in the storms of life and the attacks of spiritual enemies. <span class="cmt_word">The righteous runneth into it</span> (the tower), <span class="cmt_word">and is safe;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is set on high</span>; <span class="accented">exaltabitur</span>, Vulgate; he reaches a position where he in set above the trouble or the danger that besets him. Thus St. Peter, speaking of Christ, exclaims (<a href="../../par/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>), "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." "Prayer," says Tertullian ('De Orat.,' 29), "is the wall of faith, our arms and weapons against man who is always watching us. Therefore let us never go unarmed, night or day. Under the arms of prayer let us guard the standard of our Leader; let us wait for the angel's trumpet, praying." Septuagint, "From the greatness of his might is the Name of the Lord; and running unto it the righteous are exalted."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-14.htm">Proverbs 18:14</a></div><div class="verse">The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity.</span> That high property or faculty of man called "spirit" enables the body to bear up against trouble and sickness (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). The influence of the mind over the body, in a general sense, is here expressed. But taking "spirit" in the highest sense, in the trichotomy of human nature, we see an intimation that the grace of God, the supernatural infusion of his presence, is that which strengthens the man and makes him able to endure with patience. <span class="cmt_word">But a wounded</span> (<span class="accented">broken</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>spirit who can bear?</span> The body can, as it were, fall back upon the support of the spirit, when it is distressed and weakened; but when the spirit itself is broken, grieved, wearied, debilitated, it has no resource, no higher faculty to which it can appeal, and it must succumb beneath the pressure. Here is a lesson, too, concerning the treatment of others. We should be more careful not to wound a brother's spirit than we are to refrain from doing a bodily injury; the latter may be healed by medical applications; the former is more severe in its effects, and is often irremediable. In the first clause, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> "spirit," is masculine, in the second it is feminine, intimating by the change of gender that in the former case it is a manly property, virile moral quality, in the latter it has become weakened and depressed through affliction. Septuagint, "A prudent servant soothes a man's wrath; but a man of faint heart (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) who will endure?" The LXX. take "spirit" in the sense of anger, and "infirmity" as standing for a servant, though whore they find "prudent" is difficult to say. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Spiritum vero ad irascendum facilem, quis poterit sustinere</span>? The Latin interpreter takes one form of weakness of spirit, viz. irascibility, as his interpretation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5db;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>, "wounded." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:78) has yet another version, "Who can dwell with a man whose spirit is ready to wrath?" adding, "For he that does not regulate his feelings by the  reason that is proper to man, must needs live alone like a beast." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-15.htm">Proverbs 18:15</a></div><div class="verse">The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The first clause is similar to <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-14.htm">Proverbs 15:14</a>; the second gives a kind of explanation of the former - the understanding of the wise man is always expanding and increasing its stores, because his ear is open to instruction, and his ability grows by wholesome exercise (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>). <span class="accented">Daath</span>, "knowledge," which is used in both clauses, the LXX. translates by two words, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>.

Some consider it to mean a bribe offered for underhand or fraudulent purposes; but the context does not lead to this conclusion, and the parallel passage mentioned above makes against it. Hitzig sees in it a spiritual gift, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; but such a meaning is not elsewhere attached to the word. The term here signifies the present which duty or friendship offers to one whom one wishes to please. This paves a man's way to a great person's presence. <span class="cmt_word">Bringeth him before great men.</span> The Oriental custom of offering suitable gifts to one in authority, when a favour or an audience is desired, is here alluded to (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). So the Magi brought gifts so the newborn King at Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>). In a spiritual sense, the right use of riches opens the way to eternal life, evincing a man's practical love of God and man; as Christ says (<a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>), "Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles" (Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a></div><div class="verse"><i>He that is</i> first in his own cause <i>seemeth</i> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is first in his own cause seemeth just;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">he that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just.</span> A man who tells his own story, and is the first to open his case before the judge or a third party, seems tot the moment to have justice on his side. <span class="cmt_word">But his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/28-11.htm">Proverbs 28:11</a>). The "neighbour" is the opposing party - <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> Septuagint, which recalls <a href="../../par/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a> - he sifts and scrutinizes the statements already given, shows them to be erroneous, or weakens the evidence which appeared to support them. Thus the maxims, "One story is good till the other is told," and "Audi alteram partem," receive confirmation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justus prior est accusator sui.</span> So Septuagint, "The righteous is his own accuser in opening the suit (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>)." He cuts the ground from under the adversary's feet by at once owning his fault. St. Gregory more than once, in his 'Moralia,' adduces this rendering. Thus on <a href="../../par/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>, "To put the mouth to labour is to employ it in the confession of sin done, but the righteous man doth not refrain his mouth, in that, forestalling the wrath of the searching Judge, he falls wroth upon himself in words of self-confession. Hence it is written, 'The just man is first the accuser of himself'" (so lib. 22:33). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a></div><div class="verse">The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lot causeth contentions to cease</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). If this verse is taken in connection with the preceding, it refers to the decision in doubtful cases, where the evidence is conflicting and ordinary investigation fails to elicit the truth satisfactorily. The lot, being considered to show the judgment of God, settled the question. <span class="cmt_word">And parteth between the mighty.</span> If it were not for the decision by lot, persons of eminence and power would settle their differences by violent means. This peaceful solution obviates all such contentions. The Septuagint, in place of "lot" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), reads now <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "silent;" but it is evidently originally a clerical error, perpetuated by copyists. The error is noted by a second hand in the margin of the Sinaitic Manuscript. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19</a></div><div class="verse">A brother offended <i>is harder to be won</i> than a strong city: and <i>their</i> contentions <i>are</i> like the bars of a castle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city.</span> Something must be supplied on which the comparative notion <span class="accented">min</span>, "than," depends. So we may understand "resists more," or something similar. A brother or a once close friend, when injured or deceived, becomes a potent and irreconcilable enemy. The idea of the preceding verses is carried on, and the primary thought is still concerning lawsuits and matters brought before a judge. This is shown in the second clause by the use of the word "contentions" (<span class="accented">midyanim</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</span> They close the door against reconciliation, shut the heart against all feeling of tenderness.

Aristotle also writes thus ('De Republ.,' 7:7): "If men receive no return from those to whom they have shown kindness, they deem themselves, not only defrauded of due gratitude, but actually injured. Whence it is said, 'Bitter are the quarrels of friends;' and, 'Those who love beyond measure also hate beyond measure.'" An English maxim gloomily decides, "Friendship once injured is forever lost." Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:4), "Ut adamas, si frangi contingat malleis, in minutissimas dissidit crustas, adeo ut vix oculis cerni queant: ita arctissima necessitudo, si quando contingat dirimi, in summam vertitur simultatem, et ex arctissimis foederibus, si semel rumpantur, maxima nascuntur dissidia." Ecclus. 6:9, "There  is a friend, who being turned to enmity will also discover thy disgraceful strife," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will disclose the quarrel which according to his representation will redound to thy discredit. The Vulgate and Septuagint have followed a different reading from that of the present Hebrew text: "Brother aided by brother is like a strong and high city, and he is powerful as a well founded palace," Septuagint. The last clause is rendered in the Vulgate. <span class="accented">Et judicia quasi vectes urbium</span>; where <span class="accented">judicia</span> means "lawsuits," legal disputes; these bar out friendship. The first member of the sentence in the Greek and Latin recalls <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>, etc., "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour," etc. St. Chrysostom, commenting on <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a> ('Hom.,' 9.), writes, "A glorious bond is this; with this bond let us bind ourselves together alike to one another and to God. This is a bond that bruises not, nor cramps the hands it binds, but it leaves them free, and gives them ample play and greater energy than those which are at liberty. The strong, if he be bound to the weak, will support him, and not suffer him to perish; and if again he be tied to the indolent, he will rather rouse and animate. 'Brother helped by brother,' it is said, 'is as a strong city.' This chain no distance of place can interrupt, neither heaven, nor earth, nor death, nor anything else, but it is more powerful and stronger than all things."

It seems to be a further explanation of the statement in the text, founded on the practice prevalent at the time when the Septuagint Version was composed, which appears to have made divorce a recognized necessity in the case of adultery: "He who casteth away a good a wife casteth away good things; but he who retaineth an adulteress is a fool and impious." The advice of Siracides concerning a wicked wife is austere: "If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh" (Ecclus. 25:26). Nothing is here said about the marriage of divorced persons; but the absolute indissolubility of the marriage bond was never held among the Jews, a certain laxity being allowed because of the hardness of their heart  (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>, etc.).

The rich man not only does wrong, but accompanies the injury with passionate language and abuse, as if he were the sufferer; while the poor man has humbly to ask pardon, as if he were in the wrong.

It is not the number of so called friends that is really useful and precious. <span class="cmt_word">But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-10.htm">Proverbs 27:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thy true friends hold as very brethren."</span> The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Vir amabilis ad societatem magis amicus erit quam frater</span>, "A man amiable in intercourse will be more of a friend than even a brother." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 17"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 19"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
