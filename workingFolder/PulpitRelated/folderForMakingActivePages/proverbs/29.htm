Compare "a man of sorrows" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The hardening of the neck is a metaphor derived from obstinate draught animals who will not submit to the yoke (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>). Christ calls his yoke easy, and bids his followers to bear it bravely (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. etc.). The reproofs may arise from the Holy Spirit and the conscience, from the teaching of the past, or from the counsel of friends. The LXX. (as some other Jewish interpreters) takes the expression in the text actively, "A man who reproves (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is better than one of stiff neck." <span class="cmt_word">Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-10.htm">Proverbs 15:10</a>).

And there is no hope in their end; despising all correction, they can have no possibility of restoration. We may refer, as an illustration, to that terrible passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.), and to the fate of the Jews unto  the present day.

Aquila and Theodotion have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "man of heave offerings," and Wordsworth regards him as a man who claims and receives gifts, as if he were a deity on earth. Whichever sense we give to the phrase, the contrast lies between the inflexibly upright ruler and the iniquitous or extortionate prince. The Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a transgressor;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">vir avarus</span>.

If a man listens to such flattering words, and is influenced by them, he works his own ruin; self-deceived, he knows not his real condition, and accordingly makes grievous disaster of his life. The LXX. gives a different turn to the sentence, "He that prepareth a net before his friend entangles his own feet therein" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-10.htm">Proverbs 28:10</a>).

The snare is that the sinner is caught and held fast by his sin, and cannot escape, as he knows nothing of repentance, and has no will to cast off evil habits (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). (For "snare," comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-25.htm">Proverbs 22:25</a>.) Septuagint, "For a man sinning there lies a great snare." <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</span> The antithesis is not very obvious. It may mean that the good man has a conscience at peace, is free from the snare of sin, and therefore is glad; or that, in spite of a momentary fall, though he has transgressed, he knows that God forgives him on his repentance, and this makes him happy; or, generally that he rejoices in the happy life which his virtue procures for him here and hereafter (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>). In the original "sing" represents the sudden outburst of joy, "rejoice" the continued state of happiness. "The righteous shall be in joy and gladness (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>)," Septuagint.

Septuagint, "A righteous man knows how to judge for the poor." <span class="cmt_word">The wicked regardeth not to know it.</span> This is a clumsy translation; it means, pays no attention so as to become fully acquainted with its details and bearings. But the words signify rather, as in the Revised Version margin, "understandeth not knowledge" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>), has no knowledge which would lead him to enter into the poor man's case, and to sympathize with him in his distress; the claims of the feeble to recognition and relief at his hands are utterly unknown and disregarded. He can daily look on Lazarus at his gate, and find no call for his pity and charity; he can see the wounded traveller in the road, and pass by on the other side. The LXX. offers two translations of the latter clause, reading the second time <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;</span>, and thereby not improving the sense: "But the ungodly understand. eth not knowledge, and the poor man hath not an understanding mind." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/29-8.htm">Proverbs 29:8</a></div><div class="verse">Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise <i>men</i> turn away wrath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Scornful men bring a airy into a snare.</span> "Men of derision" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>) are those who despise and scoff at all things great and high, whether sacred or profane (see on Proverbs 1:22). These are the persons who raise rebellion in a country and excite opposition to constituted authority. The rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, "bring into a snare," as in the Authorized Version, is supported by some of the Jewish versions and  commentaries; but the more correct rendering is "blow into a blaze, inflame," as the Revised Version (comp. <a href="../../par/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20, 21</a>). These scorners excite the populace to acts of fury, when all respect for piety and virtue is lost; they fan the passions of the fickle people, and lead them to civil discord and dangerous excesses (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a>). Septuagint, "Lawless men burn up a city." <span class="cmt_word">But wise men turn away wrath;</span> by their prudent counsels allay the angry passions roused by those evil men (see Ver. 11 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1, 18</a>).

St. Jerome makes the former the subject, <span class="accented">Vir sapiens</span>, <span class="accented">si cum stulto contenderit</span>, <span class="accented">sive irascatur</span>, <span class="accented">sive rideat</span>, <span class="accented">non inveniet requiem</span>. It matters not how the wise man treats the fool; he may be stern and angry, he may be gentle and good tempered, yet the fool will be none the better, will not be reformed, will not cease from his folly, will carry on his cavilling contention. Hitzig, Delitzsch, and others, deeming that the rage and the laughter are not becoming to the character of the wise man, take the fool as the subject; so that the sense is, that after all has been said, the fool only falls into a passion or laughs at the matter, argument is wasted upon him, and the controversy is never settled. This seems to be the best interpretation, and is somewhat supported by the Septuagint, "A wise man shall judge the nations, but a worthless man, being angry, laughs and fears not [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, which may also mean, 'is derided and terrifies no one']." Wordsworth notes that the irreligious fool is won neither by the austere preaching of John the Baptist nor by the mild teaching of Christ, but rejects both (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16-19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/29-10.htm">Proverbs 29:10</a></div><div class="verse">The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bloodthirsty hate the upright;</span> <span class="accented">him that is perfect</span>, Revised Version; <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint. His life is a tacit reproach to men of blood, robbers, murderers, and such like sinners, as is finely expressed in the Book of Wisdom 2:12, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the just seek his soul.</span> The explanation of this hemistich is doubtful. The following interpretations have been offered: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The just seek the soul of the upright to deliver him from death temporal and spiritual (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-6.htm">Proverbs 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The just seek the murderer's life, take vengeance on him (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/63-9.htm">Psalm 63:9, 10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "As for the just, they (the murderers) attempt his life," where the change of subject, though by no means unparalleled, is awkward (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14</a>). The second explanation makes the righteous the executioners of vengeance on the delinquents, which does not seem to be the idea intended, and there is no confirmation of it in our book. The interpretation first given has against it the fact that the phrase, "to seek the soul," is used of attempts against the life, not of preserving it. But this is not fatal; and the above seems to be the most likely explanation offered, and gives a good antithesis. Men of blood hate a virtuous man, and try to destroy him; the righteous love him, and do their utmost to defend and keep him safe. If this interpretation is rejected, the third explanation is allowable, the <span class="accented">casus pendens</span> - "the just, they seek his life" - may be compared with <a href="../../par/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>. Septuagint, "But the upright will seek (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) his life." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/29-11.htm">Proverbs 29:11</a></div><div class="verse">A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise <i>man</i> keepeth it in till afterwards.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool uttereth all his mind;</span> <span class="accented">his spirit</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

The wording of the second hemistich confirms this rendering. A fool pours out his wrath, restrained by no consideration. It is a wise maxim that says, "Command your temper, lest it command you;" and again, "When passion enters in at the foregate, wisdom goes out at the postern." So we have the word attributed to Evenus Parius - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Wrath often hath revealed man's hidden mind,<br />Than madness more pernicious."</span> A wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. This clause is capable of more than one explanation. The Authorized Version says that the wise man restrains his own anger till he can give it proper vent. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> occurs nowhere else, and is rendered "at last," "finally," and by Delitzsch, "within," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in his heart. The verb rendered "keepeth in" (<span class="accented">shabach</span>) is rather "to calm," "to hush," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, "Which stilleth the noise of the seas." So we have the meaning: The wise man calms the auger within him; according to the proverb, <span class="accented">Irae dilatio</span>, <span class="accented">mentis pacatio</span>. Or the anger calmed may be that of the fool: The wise man appeases it after it has been exhibited; he knows how to apply soothing remedies to the angry man, and in the end renders him calm and amenable to reason. This seems the most suitable explanation. Septuagint, "A wise man husbands it (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in part."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a></div><div class="verse">Where <i>there is</i> no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy <i>is</i> he.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where there is no vision, the people perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">cast off restraint</span>, become ungovernable, cannot be reined in (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22, 25</a>). "Vision" (<span class="accented">chazon</span>), prophecy in its widest sense, denotes the revelation of God's will made through agents, which directed the course of events,  and was intended to be coordinate with the supreme secular authority. The prophets were the instructors of the people in Divine things, standing witnesses of the truth and power of religion, teaching a higher than mere human morality. The fatal effect of the absence of such revelation of God's will is stated to be confusion, disorder, and rebellion; the people, uncontrolled, fall into grievous excesses, which nothing but high principles can restrain. We note the licence of Eli's time, when there was no open vision (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a>.); in Asa's days, when Israel had long been without a teaching priest (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>); and when the impious Ahaz "made Judah naked" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19</a>); or when the people were destroyed by reason of lack of knowledge of Divine things (<a href="../../par/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). Thus the importance of prophecy in regulating the life and religion of the people is fully acknowledged by the writer, in whose time, doubtless, the prophetical office was in full exercise: but this seems to be the only passage in the book where such teaching is directly mentioned; the instructors and preceptors elsewhere introduced as disseminating the principles of the <span class="accented">chochmah</span> being parents, or tutors, or professors, not inspired prophets. <span class="cmt_word">But he that keepeth the Law, happy is he!</span> "The Law" (<span class="accented">torah</span>) is not merely the written Mosaic Law, but the announcement of God's will by the mouth of his representatives; and the thought is, not the blessedness of those who in a time of anarchy and irreligion keep to the authorized enactments of the Sinaitic legislation, but a contrast between the lawlessness and ruin of a people uninfluenced by religious guidance, and the happy state of those who obey alike the voice of God, whether conveyed in written statutes or by the teaching of living prophets. (For "happy is he," comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>.)

Septuagint, "By words a stubborn (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) slave will not be instructed." The next clause gives an explanation of this necessity. <span class="cmt_word">For though he understand he will not answer.</span> The answer is not merely the verbal response to a command, as, "I go, sir;" but it implies obedience in action. The reluctant slave thoroughly understands the order given, but he pays no heed to it, will not trouble himself to execute it, and therefore must meet with stern treatment (comp. ver. 15; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>, etc.; Proverbs 26:3). "That servant which knew his Lord's will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes" (<a href="../../par/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47</a>).

"Every one that speaks," says St. Gregory, "while he waits for his hearer's sentence upon his words, is as it were subjected to the judgment of him by whom he is heard. Accordingly, he that fears to be condemned in respect of his words ought first to put to the test that which he delivers - that there may be a kind of impartial and sober umpire sitting between the hear and tongue, weighing with exactness whether the heart presents right words, which the tongue taking up with advantage may bring forward for the heater's judgment" ('Moral.,' 8:5, Oxford transl.).

It seems safest in this uncertainty to adopt  the Jewish interpretation of "progeny:" "he will be as a son." The pampered servant will end by claiming the privileges of a son, and perhaps ousting the legitimate children from their inheritance (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>; and the case of Ziba and Mephibosheth, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>). "Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work for a servant. If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest; but if thou let him go idle, he will seek liberty" (Ecclus. 33:24, etc.). Spiritual writers have applied this proverb to the pampering of the flesh, which ought to be under the control of its master, the spirit, but which, if gratified and unrestrained, gets the upper hand, and, like a spoiled servant, dictates to its lord.

When a theft was committed, the person wronged or the judge pronounced an imprecation on the thief and on any one who was privy to the crime, and refrained from giving information; a witness who saw and knew of it, and was silent under this formal adjuration, has to bear his iniquity; he is not only an accomplice of a criminal, he is also a perjurer; one sin leads to another.

The word "abomination" (<span class="accented">toebah</span>) occurs more than twenty times in the Proverbs; it is appropriate here because the good man looks upon the sinner as the enemy of God, as the psalmist says, "Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate  thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them thine enemies" (<a href="../../par/psalms/139-21.htm">Psalm 139:21</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked;</span> because he is a standing reproach to him, and by every tone and look and action seems to express his condemnation (see on Proverbs 21:15, and the Septuagint Version there; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>: <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>).
