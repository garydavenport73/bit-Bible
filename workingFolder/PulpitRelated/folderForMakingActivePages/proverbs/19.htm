In the present reading of the second clause, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool, there seems to be a failure in antithesis, unless we can understand the fool as a rich fool. This, the repetition of the maxim in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-6.htm">Proverbs 28:6</a> ("Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich"), would lead one to admit. The Vulgate accordingly has, <span class="accented">Quam dives torquem labia sua, et insipiens</span>, "Than a rich man who is of perverse lips and a fool." With this the Syriac partly agrees. So that, if we take this reading, the moralist says that the poor man who lives a guileless, innocent life, content with his lot, and using no wrong means to improve his fortunes, is happier and better than the rich man who is hypocritical in his words and deceives others, and has won his wealth by such means, thus proving himself to be a fool, a morally bad man. But if we content ourselves with the Hebrew text, we must find the antithesis in the simple, pious, poor man, contrasted with the arrogant rich man, who sneers at his poor neighbour as an inferior creature. The writer would seem to insinuate that there is a natural connection between poverty and integrity of life on the one hand, and wealth and folly on the other. He would assent to the sweeping assertion, <span class="accented">Omnis dives ant iniquus aut iniqui heres</span>, "Every rich man is either a rascal or a rascal's heir." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-2.htm">Proverbs 19:2</a></div><div class="verse">Also, <i>that</i> the soul <i>be</i> without knowledge, <i>it is</i> not good; and he that hasteth with <i>his</i> feet sinneth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good.</span> "Also" (<span class="accented">gam</span>), Wordsworth would render "even," "even the soul, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> life itself, without knowledge is not a blessing;" it is <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. At first sight it looks as if some verse, to which this one was appended, had fallen out; but there is no trace in the versions of any such loss. We have had a verse beginning in the same manner (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>), and here it seems to emphasize what follows - folly is bad, so is ignorance, when the soul lacks knowledge, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a man does not know what to do, how to act in the circumstances of his life, has in fact no practical wisdom. Other things "not good" are named in <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>. And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth; misseth his way. Delitzsch confines the meaning of this hemistich to the undisciplined pursuit of knowledge: "He who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray," because he is neither intellectually nor morally clear as to his path or object. But the gnome is better taken in a more general sense. The ignorant man, who acts hastily without due deliberation, is sure to make grave mistakes, and to come to misfortune. Haste is opposed to knowledge, because the latter involves prudence and circumspection, while the former blunders on hurriedly, not seeing whither actions lead. We all have occasion to note the proverbs, <span class="accented">Festina lente</span>; "More haste, less speed." The history of Fabius, who, as Ennius said, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem,"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>shows the value of deliberation and caution.

It is his own folly that leads him to his ruin; but he will not see this, and blames the providence of God. <span class="cmt_word">And his heart fretteth against the Lord.</span> Septuagint, "He accuseth God in his heart" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17, 20</a>). Ecclus 15:11, etc., "Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I foil away; for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth. Say not thou, He has caused me to err; for he hath no need of the sinful man," etc. The latter part of this important passage St. Augustine quotes thus: "Item apud Salomonem: Deus ab initio constituit hominem et reliquit eum in manu consilii sui: adjecit ei mandata et praecepta; si voles praecepta servare, servabunt te, et in posterum fidem placitam facere. Apposuit tibi aquam et ignem, ad quod vis porrige manum tuam. Ante hominem bonum et malum, vita et mors, paupertas et honestas a Domino Deo sunt" ('De Per. Just. Hom.,' cap. 19, &sect; 41). And again, "Manifestum est, quod si ad ignem manum mittit, et malum ac mors ei placet, id votuntas hominis operatur; si autem bonum et vitam diligit, non solum voluntas id agit, sed divinitus adjuvatur" ('De Gest.

The idea of man's selfishness is carried on in vers. 6 and 7. The Law of Moses had tried to counteract it (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>, etc.), but it was Christianity that introduced the practical realization of the law of love, and the honouring of the poor as members of Christ. Septuagint, "But the poor is deserted even by his whilom friend." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-5.htm">Proverbs 19:5</a></div><div class="verse">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall not escape.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - This verse is repeated below (ver. 9). It comes in awkwardly here, interrupting the connection which subsists between vers. 4 and 6. Its right place is doubtless where it occurs below. The Law not only strictly forbade false witness (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>), but it enacted severe penalties against offenders in this particular (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16</a>, etc.); the <span class="accented">lex</span> <span class="accented">talionis</span> was to be enforced against them, they were to receive no pity: "Life shall be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot." <span class="cmt_word">He that</span> <span class="cmt_word">speaketh lies shall not escape.</span> The Septuagint confines the notion of this clause to false accusers, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "He who maketh an unjust charge shall not escape," which renders the two clauses almost synonymous. We make a distinction between the members by seeing in the former a denunciation against a false witness in a suit, and in the second a more sweeping menace against any one, whether accuser, slanderer, sycophant, who by lying injures a neighbour. The History of Susanna is brought forward in confirmation of the well deserved fate of false accusers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"A slander is an outrage on man's life."</span>

The third line, corrected by the Septuagint, which has an addition here, runs into two clauses (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">All the brethren of the poor do hate him.</span> Even his own brothers, children of the same parents, hate and shun a poor man (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Much more do his friends go far from him.</span> There should be no interrogation. We have the expression (<span class="accented">aph-ki</span>) in <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, etc. Euripides, 'Medea,' 561 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Each single friend far from the poor man flies."</span> Septuagint. "Every one who hateth a poor brother will be also far from friendship." Then follows an addition not found m the Hebrew, "Good thought draweth nigh to those who know it, and a prudent man will find it. He who doeth much evil brings malice to perfection (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); and he who rouses words to anger shall not be safe." <span class="cmt_word">He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him;</span> or, <span class="accented">they are gone.</span> He makes a pathetic appeal to his quondam friends, but they hearken not to him. But the sense is rather, "He pursueth after, craves for, words of kindness or promises of help, and there is naught, or he gets words only and no material aid." Wordsworth quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 38:5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,<br />Qua solatus es adlocutione?<br />Irascor tibi. Sic meos amores?"</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>, "He who pursues words only shall have naught." The Hebrew is literally, "Seeking words, they are not" This is according to the Khetib; the Keri, instead of the negation <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, which makes the clause signify, "He who pursues words, they are to him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gets words and nothing else. Delitzsch and others, supplying the lost member from the Septuagint, read the third line thus: "He that hath many friends, or the friend of every one, is requited with evil; and he that seeketh (fair) speeches shall not be delivered." Cheyne also makes a distich of this line, taking the Septuagint as representing the  original reading, "He that does much evil perfects mischief: He that provokes with words shall not escape." That something has fallen out of the Hebrew text is evident; it seems that there are no examples of tristichs in this part of our book, though they are not unknown in the first and third divisions. The Vulgate surmounts the difficulty by connecting this third line with the following verse, which thus is made to form the antithesis, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>; <span class="accented">Qui autem possessor est mentis, diligit animam suam, et custos prudentiae inveniet bona."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8</a></div><div class="verse">He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul</span>. "Wisdom" is, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">leb.</span> "heart;" it is a matter, not of intellect only. but of will and affections (see on Proverbs 15:32). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "loveth himself." The contrary, "hateth his own soul," occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-24.htm">Proverbs 29:24</a>. By striving to obtain wisdom a man shows that he has regard for the welfare of his soul and body. Hence St. Thomas Aquinas ('Sum. Theol.,' 1:2, qu. 25, art. 7, quoted by Corn. a Lapide) takes occasion to demonstrate that only good men are really lovers of themselves, while evil men are practically self-haters, proving his position by a reference to Arislotle's numeration of the characteristics of friendship, which the former exhibit, and none of which the latter can possess ('Eth. Nic.,' 9:4). <span class="cmt_word">He that keepeth understanding shall find</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>). A man must not only strive hard and use all available means to get wisdom and prudence, he must guard them like a precious treasure, not lose them for want of care or let them lie useless; and then he will find that they bring with themselves innumerable benefits. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-9.htm">Proverbs 19:9</a></div><div class="verse">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall perish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - A repetition of ver. 5, except that <span class="cmt_word">shall perish</span> is substituted for "shall not escape."

Such a life is ruin to a fool. who knows not how to use it properly; it confirms him in his foolish, sinful ways. A man needs religion and reason to enable him to bear prosperity advantageously, and these the fool lacks. "Secundae res," remarks Sallust ('Catil.,' 11), "sapientium animos fatigant," "Even wise men are wearied and harassed by prosperity," much more must such good fortune try those who have no practical wisdom to guide and control their enjoyment. Vatablus explains the clause to mean that it is impossible for a fool, a sinner, to enjoy peace of conscience, which alone is true delight. But looking to the next clause, we see that the moralist is thinking primarily of the elevation of a slave to a high position, and his arrogance in consequence thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</span> By the unwise favouritism of a potentate, a slave of lowly birth might be raised to eminence and set above the nobles and princes of the land. The writer of Ecclesiastes gives his experience in this matter: "I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:7</a>). The same anomaly is mentioned with censure (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-22.htm">Proverbs 30:22</a> and Ecclus. 11:5). What is the behaviour of unworthy persons thus suddenly raised to high position has formed the subject of many a satire. It is the old story of the "beggar on horseback." A German proverb declares, "Kein Scheermesser scharfer schiest, als wenn der Bauer zu Herrn wird." Claud., 'In Eutrop.,' 181, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Asperius nihil est humili, quum surgit in altum;<br />Cuncta ferit, dum cuncta timet; desaevit in omnes,<br />Ut se posse putent; nec bellua tetrior ulla<br />Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis."</span> As an example of a different disposition, Cornelius a Lapide refers to the history of Agathocles. Tyrant of Syracuse, who rose from the humble occupation of a potter to a position of vast power, and, to remind himself of his lowly origin, used to dine off mean earthenware. Ausonius thus alludes to this humility ('Epigr.,' 8.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Fama est fictilibus coenasse Agathoclea regem,<br />Atque abacum Samio saepe onerasse luto;<br />Fercula gemmatis cum poneret horrida vasis,<br />Et misceret opes pauperiemque simul.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">Quaerenti causam, respondit: Rex ego qui sum<br />Sicaniae, figulo sum genitore satus<br />Fortunam reverenter habe, quicunque repente<br />Dives ab exili progrediere loco."</span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a></div><div class="verse">The king's wrath <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion; but his favour <i>is</i> as dew upon the grass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion,</span> which inspires terror, as preluding danger and death. The same idea occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4, 8</a>). The Assyrian monuments have made us familiar with the lion as a type of royalty; and the famous throne of Solomon was ornamented with figures of lions on each of its six steps (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>, etc.). Thus St. Paul. alluding to the Roman emperor, says (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>), "I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion." "The lion is dead," announced Marsyas to Agrippa, on the decease of Tiberius (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:06, 10). The mondist here gives a monition to kings to repress their wrath and not to let it rage uncontrolled, and a warning to subjects not to offend their ruler, lest he tear them to pieces like a savage beast, which an Eastern despot had full power to do. <span class="cmt_word">But his favour is as dew upon the grass</span>. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a> the king's favour was compared to a cloud of the latter rain; here it is likened to the dew (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>). We hardly understand in England the real bearing of this comparison. "The secret of the luxuriant fertility of many parts of Palestine," says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 1:72, etc.), "lies in the rich supply of moisture afforded by the seawinds which blow inland each night, and water the face of the whole land. There is no dew, properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dewdrops by the coolness of the night, as in a climate like ours. From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard; and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse.... To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands The amount of moisture thus poured on the thirsty vegetation during the night is very great. Dew seemed to the Israelites a mysterious gift of Heaven, as indeed it is. That the skies should be stayed from yielding it was a special sign of Divine wrath, and there could be no more gracious conception of a loving farewell address to his people than where Moses tells them that his speech should distil as the dew. The favour of an Oriental monarch could not be more boneficially conceived than by saying that, while his wrath is like the roaring of a lion, his favour is as the dew upon the grass." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (ration), "favour," is translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">hilaritas</span>, "cheerfulness" (as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>), which gives the notion of a smiling, serene, benevolent countenance as contrasted with the angry, lowering look of displeased monarch.

The flat roofs of Eastern houses, formed of planks loosely joined and covered with a coating of clay or plaster, were always subject to leakage in heavy rains.

The Scotch say, "A leaky house and a scolding wife are two bad companions." The two clauses of the verse are coordinate, expressing two facts that render home life miserable and unendurable, viz. the misbehaviour of a son and the ill temper of a wife.

The word for "poor" is here <span class="accented">dal</span>, "feeble" (see on vers. 1 and 4). It is a beautiful thought that by showing mercy and pity we are, as it were, making God our debtor; and the truth is wonderfully advanced by Christ, who pronounces (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>), "Inasmuch as ye have done it mite one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (see on Proverbs 11:24; 28:27). St. Chrysostom ('Hom.,' 15, on <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>), "To the more imperfect this is what we may say, Give of what you have unto the needy. Increase your substance. For, saith he, 'He that giveth unto the poor lendeth unto God.' But if you are in a hurry, and wait not for the time of retribution, think of those who lend money to men; for not even these desire to get their interest immediately; but they are anxious that the principal should remain a good long while in the hands of the borrower, provided only the repayment be secure, and they have no mistrust of the borrower. Let this be done, then, in the present case also. Leave them with God, that he may pay thee thy wages manifold. Seek not to have the whole here; for if you recover it all here, how will you receive it back there? And it is on this account that God stores them up there, inasmuch as this present life is full of decay. But he gives even here also; for, 'Seek ye,' saith he, 'the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.' Well, then, let us look towards that kingdom, and not be in a hurry for the repayment of the whole, lest we diminish our recompense. But let us wait for the fit season. For the interest in these cases is not of that kind, but is such as is meet to be given by God.

Ecclus. 32(35):10, etc., "Give unto the Most High according as he hath enriched thee; and as thou hast gotten give with a cheerful eye. For the Lord recompenseth, and will give thee seven times as much." There are proverbs rife in other lands to the same effect. The Turk says, "What you give in charity in this world you take with you after death. Do good, and throw it into the sea if the fish does not know it, God does." And the Russian, "Throw bread and salt behind you, you get them before you" (Lane).

Septuagint, "Mercifulness is a gain unto a man," which is like ver. 17; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Homo indigens misericors est</span>, taking a man's desire as evidenceing his need and poverty, and introducing the idea that the experience of misery conduces to pity, as says Dido (Virgil, 'AEn.,' 1:630) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco."</span> <span class="cmt_word">A poor man is better than a liar.</span> A poor man who gives to one in distress his sympathy and good wishes, even if he can afford no substantial aid, is better than a rich man who promises much and does nothing, or who falsely professes that he is unable to help (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27, 28</a>). Septuagint, "A poor righteous man is better than a rich liar." A Buddhist maxim says, "Like a beautiful flower, full of colours, but without scent, are the fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly" (Max Muller). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a></div><div class="verse">The fear of the LORD <i>tendeth</i> to life: and <i>he that hath it</i> shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord tendeth to life</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). True religion, obedience to God's commandments, was, under a temporal dispensation, rewarded by a long and happy life in this world, an adumbration of the blessedness that awaits the righteous in the world to come. <span class="cmt_word">And he that hath it shall abide satisfied.</span> The subject passes from "the fear" to its possessor. Perhaps better, <span class="accented">and satisfied he shall pass the night</span>, which is the usual sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lun</span>), the verb here translated "abide" (so <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-31.htm">Proverbs 15:31</a>). God will satisfy the good man's hunger, so that he lays him down in peace and takes his rest (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a>). Vulgate<span class="accented">, In plenitudine commorabitur</span>, "He shall dwell in abundance." <span class="cmt_word">He shall not be visited with evil,</span> according to the, promises (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>: <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-15.htm">Deuteronomy 11:15</a>, etc.). Under our present dispensation Christians expect not immunity from care and trouble, but have hope of protection and grace sufficient for the occasion, and conducive to edification and advance in holiness. The LXX. translates thus: "The fear of the Lord is unto life for a man; but he that is without fear (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) shall sojourn in places where knowledge is not seen;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall go from bad to worse, till he ends in society where Divine knowledge is wholly absent, and lives without God in the world. The Greek interpreters read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">dea</span>), "knowledge," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">ra</span>), "evil."

At an Oriental meal the guests sit round a table, on which is placed a dish containing the food, from which every one helps himself with his fingers, knives, spoons, and forks being never used (comp. <a href="../../par/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>).

An Arabic proverb says, "He dies of hunger under the date tree." Septuagint, "He who unjustly hideth his hands in his bosom will not even apply them to his mouth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he who will not work will never feed himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a></div><div class="verse">Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, <i>and</i> he will understand knowledge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware</span>; <span class="accented">will learn prudence</span>, Revised Verson (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-11.htm">Proverbs 21:11</a>; and see note on Proverbs 1:22). The scorner is hardened to all reproof, and is beyond all hope of being reformed by punishment; in his case it is retribution for outraged virtue that is sought in the penalty which he is made to pay. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - retributive, not corrective punishment. Seeing this, the simple, who is not yet confirmed in evil, and is still open to better influences, may be led to take warning and amend his life. So St. Paul enjoins Timothy, "Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>). There is the trite adage - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Happy they<br />Who from their neighbours' perils caution learn."</span> Septuagint, "When a pestilent fellow is chastised, a fool will be cleverer (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) So Vulgate, <span class="accented">Pestilente flagellato stultus sapientior erit. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand, knowledge.</span> The scorner does not profit by severe punishment, but the intelligent man is improved by censure, and admonition (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-12.htm">Proverbs 15:12</a>). Says the adage, "Sapientem nutu, stultum fuste (corripe)," "A nod for the wise, a stick for the fool."

But as <span class="accented">musar</span> is used in a good sense throughout this book, it is better to regard the injunction as warning against listening to wise teaching with no intention of profiting by it: "Cease to hear instruction in order to err," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if you are only going to continue your evil doings. You will only increase your guilt by knowing the way of righteousness perfectly, while you refuse to walk therein. The Vulgate inserts a negation, "Cease not to hear doctrine, and be not ignorant of the war, is of knowledge;" Septuagint, "A son who fails to keep the instruction of his father will meditate evil sayings." Solomon's son Rehoboam greatly needed the admonition contained in this verse.
