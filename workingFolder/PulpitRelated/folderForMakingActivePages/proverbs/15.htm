The wise man not only has knowledge, but can give it appropriate expression (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-23.htm">Proverbs 16:23</a>). Vulgate, "The tongue of the wise adorneth wisdom." The wise man, by producing his sentiments and opinions in appropriate language and on proper occasions, commends wisdom, and renders it acceptable to his hearers. Septuagint, "The tongue of the wise knoweth what is fair (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness</span> (ver. 28). A fool cannot open his mouth without exposing his folly; he speaks without due consideration or discretion; as the Vulgate terms it, <span class="accented">ebullit</span>, "he bubbles over," like a boiling pot, which emits its contents inopportunely and uselessly. Septuagint, "The mouth of fools proclaimeth evil."

The LXX. renders the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> "are watching," as from a tower or high place. To the usual references we may add Ecclus. 15:18, 19 Ecclus. 23:19, 20.

Septuagint, "the healing of the tongue." But the Vulgate rendering is better, <span class="accented">lingua placabilis</span>, "the gentle, mild tongue" (see on Proverbs 14:30). Speech from such a source refreshes and vivifies all who come under its influence, like the wholesome fruit of a prolific tree (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The sick soul by a healing word is cured."</span> <span class="cmt_word">But perverseness therein</span> - in the tongue - <span class="cmt_word">is a breach in the spirit.</span> The perverseness intended must be falsehood, perversion of the truth. This is ruin and vexation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-14.htm">Isaiah 65:14</a>, where the same word is used) in the spirit, both in the liar himself, whose higher nature is thus terribly marred and spoiled, and in the case of his neighbour, who is injured by his slander and falsehood to the, very core. The LXX., with a different reading, translates, "But he who keepeth it [the tongue] shall be filled with the spirit." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-5.htm">Proverbs 15:5</a></div><div class="verse">A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool despiseth his father's instruction</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>): <span class="cmt_word">but he that regardeth reproof is prudent</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>). The son who attends to his father's reproof dealeth prudently, or becomes wiser. <span class="accented">Astutior fiet</span>, Vulgate; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint. The Vulgate has here a distich which is not in the Hebrew, but a similar paragraph is found in the Septuagint. Thus Vulgate, "In the abundance of righteousness virtue is greatest; but the imaginations of the wicked shall be rooted up;" Septuagint, "In the abundance of righteousness is much strength; but the impious shall be destroyed from the very root." The addition seems to have been an explanation of the following verse, which has been foisted into the text here. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-6.htm">Proverbs 15:6</a></div><div class="verse">In the house of the righteous <i>is</i> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the house of the righteous is much treasure</span> (<span class="accented">chosen</span>; see on Proverbs 27:24). The good man's store is not wasted or wrongly used, and is blest by God: and therefore, whether absolutely much or little, it is safe, and it is sufficient. In a spiritual sense, the soul of the righteous is filled with graces and adorned with good works. Septuagint, "In the houses of the righteous is much strength;" <span class="accented">plurima fortitudo</span>, Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</span> Great revenues acquired by wrong or expended badly bring only trouble, vexation, and ruin upon a man and his family. Septuagint, "The fruits of the wicked shall perish." Spiritually, the works of the wicked cause misery to themselves and others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-7.htm">Proverbs 15:7</a></div><div class="verse">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish <i>doeth</i> not so.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge</span> (ver. 2; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>). The LXX. takes the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> in its other signification of "binding" or "embracing," and translates, "The lips of the wise are bound (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) with knowledge;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> knowledge is always on them and controls their movements. The wise know when to speak, when to be silent, and what to say. <span class="cmt_word">But the heart of the foolish doeth not so</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> doth not disperse knowledge. Vulgate, <span class="accented">cor stultorum dissimile erit</span>, "will be unlike," which probably means the same as the Authorized Version. (Compare a similar use of the words <span class="accented">lo-ken</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/48-18.htm">Genesis 48:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>.) But the contrast is stated rather weakly by this rendering, lips and heart having the same office to perform; hence it is better, with Delitzsch, Ewald, and others, to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ken</span>) as an adjective in the sense of "right" or "trustworthy," and either to supply the former verb, "disperseth that which is not right," or to render, "The heart of the foot  is not directed right;" the fool goes astray, and leads himself and others into error. Septuagint, "The hearts of fools are not safe (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a></div><div class="verse">The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright <i>is</i> his delight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord.</span> The costly sacrifice of the wicked is contrasted with <span class="cmt_word">the prayer</span>, unaccompanied with sacrifice, <span class="cmt_word">of the upright</span>. The first clause occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>, and virtually in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>. But in the latter passage the prayer of the wicked is denounced as abomination. Sacrifice, as legal and ceremonial, would be more naturally open to the charge of deadness and unreality; while prayer, as spontaneous and not legally enjoined, might be deemed less liable to for realism; all the more hateful, therefore, it is if not offered from the heart. The worthlessness of external worship without obedience and devotion of the heart is often urged by the prophets (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>; see also Ecclus. 31:18, etc.). The lesson was needed that the value of sacrifice depended upon the mind and disposition of the offerer, the tendency being to rest in the <span class="accented">opus operatum</span>, as if the external action was all that was necessary to make the worshipper accepted. This text was wrested by the Donatists to support their notion of the inefficacy of heretical baptism. St. Augustine replied that the validity of the sacrament depended not on the spiritual condition of the minister, but on the appointment of Christ. The text has also been applied to confirm the opinion that all the acts of unjustified man are sin. The truer view is that God's grace does act beyond the limits of his visible Church, and that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit concurs with the free will of man before he is formally justified. The second clause recurs virtually in ver. 29.

"The way of life." the Vulgate calls it; so <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a>. Ecclesiastes 21:6, "He that hateth reproof is in the way of sinners." The Authorized Version is quite allowable, and is supported in some degree by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Doctrina mala deserenti viam vitae.</span> The sinner is annoyed by discipline, correction, or true teaching, because they curb the indulgence of his passions, make him uneasy in conscience, and force him to look to future issues. Septuagint, "The instruction of the guileless (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is known by passers-by; but they who hate reproofs die shamefully." The Syriac adopts the same rendering; but it is a question whether the word ought not to be <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. Menander says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Man unchastised learns naught."</span>

The former is used generally as the place to which the souls of the dead are consigned - the receptacle of all departed spirits, whether good or bad. Abaddon is the lowest depth of hell, the "abyss" of <a href="../../par/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a>, etc.; 20:l, etc. The clause means that God's eye penetrates even the most secret corners of the unseen world. As Job (<a href="../../par/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>) says, "Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no covering" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">How much more then the hearts of the children of men?</span> (For the form of the expression, comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a> and Proverbs 19:7; and for the import, <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>.) If God knows the secrets of the world beyond the grave, much more does he know the secret thoughts of men on earth.

But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>). Happiness is shown in the outward look, but sorrow has a deeper and more abiding influence; it touches the inner life, destroys the natural elasticity, creates despondency and despair (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>).

The Vulgate <span class="accented">pauperis</span> gives a wrong impression. The persons intended are such as take a gloomy view of things, who are always in low spirits, and cannot rise superior to present circumstances. These never have a happy moment; they are always taking anxious thought (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>), and forecasting evil. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>, translates, "At all times the eyes of the evil expect evil." <span class="cmt_word">But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.</span> The cheerful man's condition is a banquet unceasingly, a fixed state of joy and contentment. Septuagint, "But the righteous are at peace always;" Vulgate, "A secure mind is like a perpetual feast." "For," says St. Gregory ('Moral,' 12:44), "the mere repose of security is like the continuance of refreshment. Whereas, on the other hand, the evil mind is always set in pains and labours, since it is either contriving mischiefs that it may bring down, or fearing lest these be brought down upon it by others." Our own proverb says, "A contented mind is a continual feast."

In the former clause the word for "contention" is <span class="accented">madon</span>, in the latter "strife" is <span class="accented">rib</span>, which often means "law dispute." It requires two to make a quarrel, and where one keeps his temper and will not be provoked, anger must subside.

"This plant, which is really a kind of potato, grows everywhere in the warmer parts of Palestine, rising to a widely branching shrub from three to five feet high; the wood thickly set with spines; the flower like that of the potato, and the fruit, which is larger than the potato apple, perfectly round, and changing from yellow to bright red as it ripens.... The <span class="accented">osher</span> of the Arab is the true apple of Sodom. A very tropical-looking plant, its fruit is like a large smooth apple or orange, and hangs in clusters of three or four together. When ripe, it is yellow, and looks fair and attractive, and is soft to the touch, but if pressed, it bursts with a crack, and only the broken shell and a raw of small seeds in a half-open pod, with a few dry filaments, remain in the hand" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:74, 117). Cato, 'Dist.,' 54:3, 5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Segnitiem fugito, quae vitae ignavia fertur;<br />Nam quum animus languet, consumit inertia corpus."</span> To the sluggard is opposed the righteous in the second member, because indolence is a grievous sin, and the greatest contrast to the active industry of the man who fears God and does his duty. <span class="cmt_word">The way of the righteous is made plain;</span> "is a raised causeway;" <span class="accented">selulah</span>, as <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>: <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>. The upright man, who treads the path appointed for him resolutely and trustfully, finds all difficulties vanish; before him the thorns yield a passage; and that which the sluggard regarded as dangerous and impassable becomes to him as the king's highway. Vulgate, "The path of the just is without impediment;" Septuagint, "The roads of the manly (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) are well beaten." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 30:51), "Whatever adversity may have fallen in their way of life, the righteous stumble not against it.

In the multitude of counsellors they are established (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-6.htm">Proverbs 24:6</a>).

There is, of course, the danger of secrets being divulged where counsellors are many; and there is Terence's maxim to fear, "Quot heroines, tot sententiae;" but, properly guarded and discreetly used, good counsel is above all price.

The path may be steep and painful, but at any rate it has this compensation - it leads away from destruction. It is obvious to read into the passage higher teaching. The good man's path leads heavenward, to a high life here, to happiness hereafter; his conversation is in heaven (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>), his affections are set on things above (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>).

In the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions which have been preserved, there are many invoking curses, curious and multifarious, against the disturbers of boundaries.

Professor Plumptre ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) notes that the Chaldee Targum paraphrases this clause, referring especially to lucre gained by unrighteous judgments, thus: "He who gathers the mammon of unrighteousness destroys his house;" and he suggests that Christ's use of that phrase (<a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>) may have had some connection with this proverb through the version then popularly used in the Palestinian synagogues. <span class="cmt_word">He that hateth gifts shall live</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>). Primarily this refers to the judge or magistrate who is incorruptible, and gives just judgment, and dispenses his patronage without fear or favour; he shall "prolong his days" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a>), And in all cases a man free from covetousness, who takes no bribes to blind his eyes withal, who makes no unjust gains, shall pass a long and happy life undisturbed by care. We see here a hope of immortality, to which integrity leads. The LXX., with the view of making the two clauses more marked in antithesis, restricts the application thus: "The receiver of gifts destroyeth himself; but he who hateth the receiving of gifts liveth." The Vulgate and Septuagint, after this verse, introduce a distich which recurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>. The Septuagint transposes many of the verses at the end of this chapter and the beginning of the next.

The Vulgate has "obedience," implying attention to the inward warnings of conscience and grace, before the mouth speaks. Poureth out (ver. 2). The wicked man never considers; evil is always on his lips and running over from his mouth. Septuagint, "The mouth of the ungodly answereth evil things." The LXX. here inserts ch. 16:7. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD <i>is</i> far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is far from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the wicked.</span> The maxim is similar to that in ver. 8 and <a href="../../par/john/9-31.htm">John 9:31</a>, "We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth." God is said to be "far" in the sense of not listening, not regarding with favour (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>). His attention to the righteous is seen in <a href="../../par/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18, 19</a>. The LXX. introduces here <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8, 9</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a></div><div class="verse">The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <i>and</i> a good report maketh the bones fat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>). The beaming glance that shows a pure, happy mind and a friendly disposition, rejoices the heart of him on whom it is turned. There is something infectious in the guileless, joyful look of a happy man or child, which has a cheering effect upon those who observe it. The LXX. makes the sentiment altogether personal: "The eye that seeth what is good rejoiceth the heart." <span class="cmt_word">A good report</span> (good tidings) <span class="cmt_word">maketh the bones fat;</span> strengthens them and gives them health (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>). Sight and hearing are compared in the two clauses, "bones" in the latter taking the place of "heart" in the former. The happy look and good news alike cause joy of heart. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-31.htm">Proverbs 15:31</a></div><div class="verse">The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ear that heareth</span> (hearkeneth to) <span class="cmt_word">the reproof of life abideth among the wise</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>). The reproof, or instruction, of life is that which teaches the true way of pleasing God, which is indeed the only life worth living. The ear, by synecdoche, is put for the person. One who attends to and profits by such admonition may be reckoned among the wise, and rejoices to be conversant with them. Wordsworth finds a more recondite sense here: the ear of the wise dwells, lodges, passes the night (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a>) in their heart, whereas the heart of fools is in their mouth (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>). This verse is omitted in the Septuagint, though it is found in the other Greek versions and the Latin Vulgate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-32.htm">Proverbs 15:32</a></div><div class="verse">He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - This verse carries on and puts the climax to the lesson of the preceding. <span class="cmt_word">He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul;</span> "hateth himself," Septuagint; commits moral suicide, because he does not follow the path of life. He is like a sick man who thrusts away (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Septuagint) the wholesome medicine which is his only hope of cure. <span class="cmt_word">He that heareth</span> (listeneth to) <span class="cmt_word">reproof getteth understanding</span>; literally, <span class="accented">possesseth a heart</span>, and therefore does not despise his soul, but "loves it" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8</a>), as the LXX. renders. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a></div><div class="verse">The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the instruction of wisdom; and before honour <i>is</i> humility.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom;</span> that which leads to and gives wisdom (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3, 7</a>, etc.; Proverbs 9:10). 'Pirke Aboth,' 3:26, "No wisdom, no fear of God; no fear of God, no wisdom. No knowledge, no discernment; no discernment, no knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">Before honour is humility</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-12.htm">Proverbs 18:12</a>). A man who fears  God must be humble, and as the fear of God leads to wisdom, it may be said that humility leads to the honour and glory of being wise and reckoned among the wise (ver. 31). A man with a lowly opinion of himself will hearken to the teaching of the wise, and scrupulously obey the Law of God, and will be blessed in his ways. For "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble" (<a href="../../par/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>). The maxim in the second clause has a general application. "He that shall humble himself shall be exalted" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). It is sanctioned by the example of Christ himself, the Spirit itself testifying beforehand his sufferings that were to precede his glory (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; see also <a href="../../par/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5</a>, etc.). Septuagint, "The fear of the Lord is discipline and wisdom, and the beginning of glory shall answer to it." Another reading adds, "Glory goeth before the humble," which is explained to mean that the humble set before their eyes the reward that awaits their humility, and patiently endure, like Christ, "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
