The system of irrigation signified in this passage is still to be seen in Eastern lands. "Flower beds and gardens of herbs are always made at a little lower level than the surrounding ground, and are divided into small squares, a slight edging of earth banking the whole round on each side. Water is then let in, and floods the entire surface till the soil is thoroughly saturated; after which the moisture is turned off to another bed, by simply closing the opening in the one under water, by a turn of the bare foot of the gardener, and making another in the same way with the foot, in the next bed, and thus the whole garden is in due course watered .... Only, in this case, the hand is supposed to make the gap in the clay bank of the streamlet, and divert the current" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 1:9).

But it is best to make the whole verse one idea, as in the Authorized Version. The lifting of the eyes is a term implying pride, as shown in supercilious looks, as if other people were of inferior clay and not worthy of notice. So we have "haughty eyes" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a> (where see note); and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a> we read, "There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up." "The enlargement of the heart" is the cause of the proud look, for it signifies the evil affections and concupiscence of the will, wholly filled up with self, and controlling the actions and expression of the body. Septuagint, "A high-minded man (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is stout-hearted in his pride." <span class="cmt_word">And the ploughing of the wicked is sin.</span> The Authorized Version takes the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nir</span>), which means "tillage' (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>), or, as Delitzsch supposes, "land ploughed for the first time" (<span class="accented">novale</span>). The proverb, taken thus, will mean, "high look, proud heart, even all the field which the godless cultivate, all that they do, is sin." "Pride," says the Talmud, "is worse than sin." But another pointing gives a different and very appropriate (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-20.htm">Proverbs 24:20</a>) meaning. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ner</span>) signifies "a lamp." Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Lucerna impiorum peccatum</span>, "The lamp of the wicked is sin;" and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "Lamp" is, as often, a metaphor for prosperity and happiness (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>); and it is here said that the sinner's outward prosperity and joyousness, springing from no good source, being founded in self, and not resting on virtue and godliness, are in themselves sinful and displeasing to God.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <i>is</i> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue</span> - the acquisition of wealth by fraud and falsehood - <span class="cmt_word">is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death</span>. The latter clause is variously rendered and interpreted. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">a fleeting breath, those seeking death.</span> The Revised Version makes the last words a separate proposition, "They that seek them seek death." But this seems unnecessary, and somewhat opposed to the gnomic style, which often combines two predicates in one construction; and there is no reason why we should not render the words, as in the Authorized Version, "of seekers of death." Such a mode of obtaining wealth is as evanescent and unstable as the very breath, and ends in death, which is practically the result of their quest. Thus Wisd. 5:14, "The hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with the tempest, and passeth away. as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day." Some think that the comparison regards the mirage of the desert, which deceives travellers with the phantasms of cool waters and refreshing shade. Such an allusion is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>. The Talmud enjoins, "Speak no word that accords not with the truth, that thy honour may not vanish as the waters of a brook." The Septuagint and Vulgate have followed a different reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), and render thus: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vanus et excors est, et impingetur ad laqueos mortis</span>, "He is vain and foolish, and will be taken in the snares of death;" Septuagint, "pursues vain things unto the snares of death (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). So St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire to be rich fall into a into a temptation and a snare (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>), and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition."

The reason of this fate is given in the concluding hemistich: <span class="cmt_word">Because they refuse to do judgment.</span> This is a judicial retribution on them for wilfully declining (ver. 25) to do what is right. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8</a></div><div class="verse">The way of man <i>is</i> froward and strange: but <i>as for</i> the pure, his work <i>is</i> right.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of man is froward and strange;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Perversa via viri, aliens est</span>. Both this and the Authorized Version miss the antithesis between the guilty and the pure man, which is intended. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>, translated "and strange" (which seems to mean "alien from what is right"), the <span class="accented">vav</span> is not the copulative, but part of the word, which is an adjective signifying "laden with guilt;" so that the clause ought to be rendered, "Crooked is the way of a guilty man" (see note on Proverbs 2:15, where, however, the word is different, though the idea is analogous). An evil man's way of life is not open and straightforward, simple and uniform, but stealthy, crooked, perverse, whither his evil inclinations lead him. Septuagint, "To the crooked (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) God sendeth crooked ways;" which recalls <a href="../../par/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>, "With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward." God allows the wicked to punish themselves by falling into mischief. <span class="cmt_word">As for the pure, his work is right;</span> or, <span class="accented">straight</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a>). The pure in heart will be right in action; he follows his conscience and God's law, and goes direct on his course without turning or hesitation. The LXX. refers the clause to God: "for pure and right are his ways." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop.</span> One is to think of the flat roof of an Eastern house, which was used as an apartment for many purposes: <span class="accented">e,g</span>. for sleeping and conference (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25, 26</a>), for exercise (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>), for domestic matters (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>), for retirement and prayer (<a href="../../par/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>). This, though exposed to the inclemency of the weather, would be not an uncomfortable situation during a great part of the year. But the proverb implies a position abnormally inconvenient as an alternative preferable to a residence inside. Hence, perhaps, it is advisable to render, with Delitzsch, "Better to sit on the pinhole of a house roof." Septuagint, "It is better to dwell in a corner of a place open to the sky (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Than with a brawling</span> (<span class="accented">contentious</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>woman in a</span> <span class="cmt_word">wide</span> <span class="cmt_word">house;</span> literally, <span class="accented">a house of society</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a house in common (comp. ver. 19 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-24.htm">Proverbs 25:24</a>). A solitary corner, replete with inconveniences, is to be preferred to house shared with woman, wife or other female relation, of a quarrelsome and vexatious temper. The LXX. puts the matter forcibly, "than in cieled rooms with unrighteousness  and in a common house." So the Latin proverb, "Non quam late, sed quam laete habites, refert." The Scotch have a proverb to the same effect: "A house wi' a reek and a wife wi' a reerd (scold) will sune mak' a man run to the door." "I had rather dwell," says the Son of Sirach (Ecclus. 25:16), "with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman."

Nothing is safe from his malignant activity (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>). He does not look with pity on friend or neighbour, if they stand in the way of the gratification of his desires; he will sacrifice any one, however closely connected, so that he may work his will. Nothing makes a man more atrociously selfish and hard-hearted than vice (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, and the note there). The LXX. takes the sentence in a passive sense, "The soul of the ungodly shall not be pitied by any one." They who have no pity for others shall meet with no pity themselves; while, on the other hand, the Lord says, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>).

When the wise is instructed (<a href="../../par/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>), he (the wise) receiveth knowledge. The wise man uses every opportunity, takes advantage of every circumstance and event, to increase his knowledge and experience. The Vulgate carries on the subject, "And if he (the simple) follow the wise man, he shall attain knowledge." Septuagint, "When the intemperate man is punished, the simple is made cleverer; and a wise man understanding will receive knowledge." "For it often happens," says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:38). "that the mind of the weak is the more unsteadied from the hearing of the truth, as it sees the despisers of the truth flourishing; but when just vengeance takes away the unjust, it keeps others away from wickedness."

The Vulgate refers the passage to the zeal of the righteous for the salvation of sinners - a thought quite foreign to the present subject - thus: <span class="accented">Excogitat justus de domo impii, ut detrahat impios a malo</span>, "The righteous man reflects concerning the house of the wicked how he may deliver them from <span class="accented">evil."</span> The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">A righteous one looketh on the house of the wicked</span>: <span class="accented">he precipitates the wicked to destruction.</span> There is no change of subject in the two clauses, and "a righteous One" (<span class="accented">tsaddik</span>) is God, put indeterminately to excite the greater awe (comp. <a href="../../par/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a>). The Lord keeps the sinners under his eye, that he may punish them at the fit moment (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-19.htm">Job 12:19</a>). The notion of God's moral government of the universe prevails most strongly in every pronouncement of the writer. The LXX. interprets "the house" as heart and conscience, and renders, "A righteous man understands the hearts of the godless, and despises the impious in their wickednesses;" he sees through their outward felicity, knows well its unreality, and despises them for the low aims and pursuits which satisfy them.

Wordsworth considers that the writer is saying in bitter irony that the evil man shall rest as a guest at a banquet, shall lie down and be regaled, but it will be in the company of the dead.

Septuagint, "But the upright man himself understands (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) his ways." The contrast lies in the audacious self-confidence of the unprincipled man, and the calm circumspection and prudence of the saint.

Septuagint, "There is no wisdom, there is no courage (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), there is no counsel, in respect of the ungodly;" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;</span>, <span class="accented">neged Jahve</span>, being taken as "that which is against Jahve," equivalent to "impious." Wordsworth quotes Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:6. 5, etc. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Dis te minorem quod geris, imperus:<br />Hino omne principium, huc refer exitum."</span> The following verse carries on and applies the import of this one: As men's wisdom is nothing worth, equally vain is all trust in external means and appliances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a></div><div class="verse">The horse <i>is</i> prepared against the day of battle: but safety <i>is</i> of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horse is prepared against the clay of battle.</span> The horse is an emblem of military power and activity. To the earlier Jews, who were unaccustomed to its use, and indeed forbidden to employ it (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>), the horse and horse-drawn chariots were objects of extreme terror (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>), and though Solomon had largely imported them from Egypt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>, etc.), these animals were used exclusively for war, and, at this time, their services were never applied to agricultural purposes. The proverb asserts that, though all preparations are made for the battle, and material forces are of the best and strongest description, <span class="cmt_word">but safety</span> (<span class="accented">victory</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is of the Lord</span> (see <a href="../../par/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>, etc.). Septuagint, "But from the Lord is the help (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>)." The great truth here taught may be applied to spiritual matters. The only safety against spiritual enemies is the grace of God; we can cry, with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>), "Thanks be  to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." "By the name 'horse,'" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 31:43), "is understood the preparation of right intention, as it is written, 'The horse is prepared,' etc.; because the mind prepares itself indeed against temptation, but contends not healthfully unless it be assisted from above." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 20"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 22"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
