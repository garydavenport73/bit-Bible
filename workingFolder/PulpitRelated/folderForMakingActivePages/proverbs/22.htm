It will be observed that "good" in the Authorized Version is in italics, showing that the epithet is not expressed in the Hebrew, which is simply <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shem</span>), "name." But this word carried with it the notion of good repute, as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; for being well known implied honour and reputation, while being nameless (<a href="../../par/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>) signified not only obscurity, but ignominy and discredit. Hence the versions have <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">nomen bonum</span>, and Ecclus. 41:12, "Have regard to thy name (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), for that shall continue with thee above a thousand great treasures of gold. A good life," the moralist continues, "hath but few days; but a good name endureth forever" (contrast <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And loving favour rather than silver and gold;</span> or, more accurately, <span class="accented">and before gold and silver grace is good</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> grace is far better than gold. Grace (<span class="accented">chen</span>) is the manner and demeanour which win love, as well as the favour and affection gained thereby; taken as parallel to "name," in the former hemistich, it means here "favour," the regard conceived by others for a worthy object. Publ. Syr., "Bona opinio hominum tutier pecunia est." The French have a proverb, "Bonne renommee vaut mieux que ceinture doree." The latter hemistich gives the reason for the assertion in the former - a good name is so valuable because it wins affection and friendship, which are far preferable to material riches, 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a></div><div class="verse">The rich and poor meet together: the LORD <i>is</i> the maker of them all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The rich and poor meet together</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/29-13.htm">Proverbs 29:13</a>): <span class="cmt_word">the Lord is the Maker of them all</span> (<a href="../../par/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>). God has ordained that there shall be rich and poor in the world, and that they should meet in the intercourse of life. These social inequalities are ordered for wise purposes; the one helps the other. The labour of the poor makes the wealth of the rich; the wealth of the rich enables him to employ and aid the poor. Their common humanity, their fatherhood in God, should make them regard one another as brethren, without distinction of rank or position: the rich should not despise the poor (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>), the poor should not envy the rich (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-31.htm">Proverbs 3:31</a>), but all should live in love and harmony as one great family of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a></div><div class="verse">A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A prudent man foresesth the evil, and hideth himself.</span> The whole verse is repeated in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>. St. Jerome has <span class="accented">callidus</span>, and the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the translation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">arum</span>); but it must be taken in a good sense, as cautions, farseeing, prudent (see note on Proverbs 1:4) Such a man looks around, takes warning from little circumstances which might escape the observation of careless persons, and provides for his safety in good time. Thus the Christians at the siege of Jerusalem, believing Christ's warnings, retired to Pella, and wine saved. A Spanish proverb runs, "That which the fool does in the end, the wise man does at the beginning." <span class="cmt_word">The simple pass on, and are punished.</span> The subject of the former hemistich is in the singular number, for a really prudent man is a comparatively rare bring; the second clause is plural, teaching us, as Hitzig observes, that many simple ones are found for one prudent. These silly persons, blundering blindly on their way, without circumspection or forethought, meet with immediate punishment, incur dangers, suffer less. A Cornish proverb runs, "He who will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the rock." Septuagint, "An intelligent man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) seeing a wicked man punished is himself forcibly instructed; but fools pass by, and are punished" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-11.htm">Proverbs 21:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a></div><div class="verse">By humility <i>and</i> the fear of the LORD <i>are</i> riches, and honour, and life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By humility and the fear of the Lord,</span> etc. This does not seem to be the best rendering of the original. The word rendered "by" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> <span class="accented">ekeb</span>), "in reward of," is also taken as the subject of the sentence: "The reward of humility ['and,' or, 'which is'] the fear of God, is riches," etc. There is no copulative in the clause, and a similar asyndeton occurs in ver. 5; so there is no reason why we should not regard the clause in this way. Thus Revised Version, Nowack,  and others. But Delitzsch makes the first hemistich a concluded sentence, which the second member carries on thus: "The reward of humility is the fear of the Lord; it [the reward of humility] is at the same time riches," etc. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Finis modestiae timor Domini, divitiae et gloria et vita</span>; Septuagint, "The generation (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f70;</span>) of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and wealth," etc. It is preferable to translate as above, taking the two expressed virtues as appositional, thus: "The reward of humility, the fear of the Lord." Humility brings with it true religion, which is expressed by "the fear of the Lord." The feeling of dependence, the lowly opinion of self, the surrender of the will, the conviction of sin, all effects which are connected with humility, may well be represented by this term, "the fear of God," which, in another aspect, is itself the source of every virtue and every blessing; <span class="cmt_word">it is riches, and honour, and life.</span> These are God's gifts, the guerdon of faithful service (see notes on Proverbs 3:16 and Proverbs 21:21; and comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-18.htm">Proverbs 8:18</a>). The Easterns have a pretty maxim, "The bending of the humble is the graceful droop of the branches laden with fruit." And again, "Fruitful trees bend down; the wise stoop; a dry stick and a fool can be broken, not bent" (Lane). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-5.htm">Proverbs 22:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thorns <i>and</i> snares <i>are</i> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward.</span> The words are in the Hebrew without the conjunction (see note, ver. 4), though the versions generally add it. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">arma et gladiii</span> but the Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. It is a question whether the thorns are what the perverse prepare for others, or what they themselves suffer. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a> the hedge of thorns represented the difficulties in the sluggard's path; but here, viewed in connection with the following hemistich, the thorns and snares refer to the hindrances proceeding from the froward, which injuriously affect others; "thorns" being a figure of the pains and troubles, "snares" of the unexpected dangers and impediments which evil men cause as they go on their crooked way. The word for "thorns" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, which occurs in <a href="../../par/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>. The plant is supposed to be the <span class="accented">Rhamnus paliurus</span>, but it has not been accurately identified. <span class="cmt_word">He that doth keep his soul shall be far from them</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>). The man who has regard to his life and morals will go far, will keep wholly aloof, from those perils and traps into which the perverse try to entice them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a></div><div class="verse">Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Train up a child in the way he should go.</span> The verb translated "train" (<span class="accented">chanak</span>) means, first, "to put something into the mouth," "to give to be tasted," as nurses give to infants food which they have masticated in order to prepare it for their nurslings; thence it comes to signify "to give elementary instruction," "to imbue," "to train." The Hebrew literally is, <span class="accented">Initiate a child in accordance with his way.</span> The Authorized Version, with which Ewald agrees, takes the maxim to mean that the child should be trained from the first in the right path - the path of obedience and religion. This is a very true and valuable rule, but it is not what the author intends. "His way" must mean one of two things - either his future calling and station, or his character and natural inclination and capacity. Delitzsch and Plumptre take the latter interpretation; Nowack and Bertheau the former, on the ground that <span class="accented">derek</span> is not used in the other sense suggested. But, as far as use is concerned, both explanations stand on much the same ground; and it seems more in conformity with the moralist's age and nation to see in the maxim an injunction to consider the child's nature, faculties, and temperament, in the education which is given to him. If, from his early years, a child is thus trained, <span class="cmt_word">when he is old, he will not depart from it.</span> This way, this education in accordance with his idiosyncrasy, will bear fruit all his life long; it will become a second nature, and will never be obliterated. The Vulgate commences the verse with <span class="accented">Proverbium est</span>, taking the first word substantively, as if the author here cited a trite saying; but the rendering is a mistake. There are similar maxims, common at all times and in all countries. Virg., 'Georg.,' 2:272 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adeo in teneris consuescere multum est."</span> Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:2, 67 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nunc adbibe puro<br />Pectore verba, puer."</span> For, as he proceeds - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem<br />Testa diu."</span> Thus we have two mediaeval jingles - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Cui puer assuescit, major dimittere nescit."<br />"Quod nova testa capit, inveterata sapit."</span> Then there is the German saw, "Jung gewohnt, alt gethan." "What youth learns, age does not forget," says the Danish proverb. In another and a sad sense the French exclaim, "St jeunesse savait! si vieillesse pouvait!" All the early manuscripts of the Septuagint omit this verse; m some of the later it has been supplied from Theodotion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a></div><div class="verse">The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <i>is</i> servant to the lender.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The rich ruleth over the poor.</span> "The rich man (singular) will rule over the poor" (plural); for there are many poor for one rich (see on ver. 3). This is the way  of the world (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-23.htm">Proverbs 18:23</a>). Aben Ezra explains the gnome as showing the advantage of wealth and the inconvenience of poverty; the former bringing power and pre-eminence, the latter trouble and servitude; and hence the moralist implies that every one should strive and labour to obtain a competency, and thus avoid the evils of impecuniosity. The borrower is servant to the lender. (For the relation between borrower and louder, or debtor and creditor, see on Proverbs 20:16; and comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25, 34</a>.) Delitzsch cites the German saying, "Borghart (borrower) is Lehnhart's (leader's) servant." We have the proverb, "He that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing." The Septuagint departs from the other versions and our Hebrew text, translating, "The rich will role over the poor, and household servants will lend to their own masters" - a reading on which some of the Fathers have commented. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a></div><div class="verse">He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity;</span> shall gain nothing substantial, shall have nothing to show for his pains. But <span class="accented">aven</span> also means "calamity," "trouble," as <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>; so the gnome expresses the truth that they who do evil shall meet with punishment in their very sins - the exact contrast to the promise to the righteous (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>). "To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward." Thus we have in <a href="../../par/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>, "They that plough iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same;" and the apostle asserts (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, etc), "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting." Eastern proverbs run, "As the sin, so the atonement:" "Those who sow thorns can only reap prickles" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the rod of his anger shall fail.</span> The writer is thinking especially of cruelty and injustice practised on a neighbour, as Delitzsch has pointed out, and he means that the rod which he has raised, the violence intended against the innocent victim, shall vanish away or fall harmlessly. Ewald and others think that the rod is the Divine anger, and translate the verb (<span class="accented">kalah</span>) "is prepared," a sense which here it will not well bear, though the LXX. has lent some countenance to it by rendering, "And shall fully accomplish the plague (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>,? 'punishment') of his deeds." The rendering, "shall fail." "shall be consumed, or annihilated," is confirmed by <a href="../../par/genesis/21-15.htm">Genesis 21:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-28.htm">Isaiah 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>, etc. The Septuagint adds a distich here, of which the first member is a variant of ver. 9<span class="accented">a</span>. and the second another rendering of the latter hemistich of the present verse: "A cheerful man and a giver God blesseth (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>): but he shall bring to an end (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) the vanity of his works." The first hemistich is remarkable for being quoted by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>), with a slight variation, <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. So Ecclus. 32 (35):9, "In all thy gifts show a cheerful countenance (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a></div><div class="verse">He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed</span>. The "good of eye" is the kindly looking, the benevolent man, in contrast to him of the evil eye, the envious, the unfriendly and niggardly man (<a href="../../par/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>). St. Jerome renders, <span class="accented">Qui pronus est ad misericordiam.</span> Such a one is blessed by God in this world and the next, in time and in eternity, according to the sentiment of <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>. Thus in the temporal sense (Ecclus. 34 (31):23). "Him that is liberal in food lips shall bless, and the testimony of his liberality will be believed." Septuagint, "He that hath pity upon the poor shall himself be continually sustained (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." The reason is added, For he giveth of his brans to the poor. The blessing is the consequence of his charity and liberality. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>, "He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Vulgate and Septuagint add a distich not in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Victoriam et honorem acquiret qui dat munera</span>; <span class="accented">animam autem aufert accipientium</span>; <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, "Victory and honour he obtaineth who giveth gifts; but he takes away the life of the possessors." The first hemistich appears to be a variant of <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a><span class="accented">b</span>, the second to be derived from <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a><span class="accented">b</span>. The second portion of the Latin addition may mean that the liberal man wins and carries away with him the souls of the recipients of his bounty. But this, though Ewald would fain have it so, cannot be the signification of the corresponding Greek, which seems to mean that the man who is so liberal in distributing gifts obtains the power to do so by oppressing and wronging others.

We have had something very similar at ch. 16:13. Some of the versions consider that by the king God is meant. Thus the Septuagint, "The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all blameless persons are acceptable with him." The rest of the clause is connected by the LXX. with the following verse, "A king guides his flock (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) with his lips; but the eyes of the Lord," etc.

The expression, "preserve knowledge," is found at Proverbs 5:2 (where see note) in the sense of "keep," "retain," and, taken by itself, it might here signify that the Lord alone possesses knowledge, and alone imparts it to his servants (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>); but as in the following clause a person, the transgressor, is spoken of, it is natural to expect a similar expression in the former. The Revised Version is correct in rendering the abstract "knowledge" by the concrete "him that hath knowledge;" so that the clause says that God watches over and protects the man who knows him and walks in his ways, and uses his means and abilities for the good of others (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-9.htm">Proverbs 11:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he</span> (the Lord) <span class="cmt_word">overthroweth</span> <span class="cmt_word">the words of the transgressor</span>.

The supposed lion is without, in the open country, and yet he professes to be in danger in the midst of the town. <span class="cmt_word">I shall be slain in the streets.</span> Others consider that the sluggard makes two excuses for his inactivity. If work calls him abroad, he may meet the lion which report says is prowling in the neighbourhood; if he has to go into the streets, he may be attacked and murdered by ruffians for motives of plunder or revenge. "Sluggards are prophets," says the Hebrew proverb. Septuagint, "The sluggard maketh excuses, and saith, A lion is in the ways, there are murderers in the streets." Lions, though now extinct in Palestine, seem to have lingered till the time of the Crusades, and such of them as became man eaters, the old or feeble, were a real danger in the vicinity of villages (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>).

(For "strange woman" as equivalent to "a harlot" or "adulteress," see note on Proverbs 2:16.) By her "mouth" is meant her wanton, seductive words, which entice a man to destruction of body and soul. It may be that theology rather than morals is signified here - rather false doctrines than evil practice. In this case the mention of the strange or foreign woman is very appropriate, seeing that perversions of belief and worship were always introduced into Israel from external sources. <span class="cmt_word">He that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein.</span> He who has incurred the width of God by previous unfaithfulness and sin is left to himself to fall a prey to the allurements of the wicked woman (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>).

Then are added three lines not in the Hebrew, which, however, seem to be reminiscences of other passages: "There are evil ways before a man, and be loveth not to turn away from them; but it is needful to turn away item a perverse and evil way."

Septuagint, "Folly is attached (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) to the heart of the young," in which version Cornelius a Lapide sees an allusion to the ornament hung by fond parents round the neck of a child whom they were inclined to spoil rather than to train in self-denying ways. To such a child folly adheres as closely as the <span class="accented">bulla</span> with which he is decorated. But <span class="cmt_word">the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</span> Judicious education overcomes this natural tendency, by punishing it when  exhibited, and imparting wisdom and piety (see on Proverbs 13:24 and Proverbs 19:18; and comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-15.htm">Proverbs 29:15</a>; Ecclus. 30:1, etc). The LXX. pursue their notion of the the indulgent parents letting the child have his own way, for they render the last clause, "But the rod and discipline are far from him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a></div><div class="verse">He that oppresseth the poor to increase his <i>riches, and</i> he that giveth to the rich, <i>shall</i> surely <i>come</i> to want.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches</span> (so the Vulgate), <span class="cmt_word">and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.</span> There are various renderings and explanations of this verse. The Authorized Version says that he who oppresseth the poor to enrich himself, and he who wastes his means by giving to those who do not need it, will come to poverty. But the antithesis of this distich is thus lost. The Hebrew literally rendered brings out the contrast, <span class="accented">Whosoever oppresseth the poor, it is for his gain</span>; <span class="accented">whosoever giveth to the rich, it is for his loss.</span> Delitzsch explains the sentence thus: "He who enriches himself by extortion from the poor, at any rate gains what he desires; but he who gives to the rich impoverishes himself in vain, has no thanks, reaps only disappointment." One cannot but feel that the maxim thus interpreted is poor and unsatisfactory. The interpretation in the 'Speaker's Commentary' is more plausible: The oppressor of the poor will himself suffer in a similar mode, and will have to surrender his ill-gotten gains to some equally unscrupulous rich man. But the terse antithesis of the original is wholly obscured by this view of the distich. It is far better, with Hitzig, Ewald, and others, to take the gain in the first hemistich as that of the poor man, equivalent to "doth but bring him gain;" though the sentence is not necessarily to be explained as suggesting that the injustice which the poor man suffers at the hand of his wealthy neighbour is a stimulus to him to exert himself in order to better his position, and thus indirectly tends to his enrichment. The maxim is really conceived in the religious style of so many of these apparently worldly pronouncements, and states a truth in the moral government of God intimated elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>; and that truth is that the riches extorted from the poor man will in the end redound to his benefit, that by God's providential control the oppression and injustice from which he has suffered shall work to his good. In the second hemistich the loss is that of the rich man. By adding to the wealth of the rich the donor increases his indolence, encourages his luxury, vice, and extravagance, and thus leads to his ruin - "bringeth only to want. Septuagint, "He that calumniates (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) the poor increaseth his own substance, but giveth to the rich at a loss (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>)" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so as to lessen his substance.

It is better to take the clause in the optative, as Delitzsch, Ewald, Nowack, and ethers: "Let them abide altogether upon thy lips;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be not ashamed to profess them openly, let them regulate thy words, teach thee wisdom and discretion.

It is better to consider it as dependent on the second hemistich, the fact of instruction being placed after the statement of its object. All the instruction herein afforded is meant to teach that entire confidence in the Lord which, as soon as his will is known and understood, leads a man to do it at any cost or pains, leaving the result in God's hands. <span class="cmt_word">I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.</span> The repetition of the personal pronoun brings home the teaching to the disciple, and shows that it is addressed, not merely to the mass of men, but to each individual among them, who thus becomes responsible for the use which he makes of it (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>). The expression, "this day," further emphasizes the exhortation. The learner is not to remember vaguely that some time or other he received this instruction, but that on this particular  day the warning was given. So in <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7, 13</a> we read, "As the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.... Exhort one another daily, so long as it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." Septuagint, "That thy hope may be in the Lord, and he may make thy way known unto thee." Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') quotes Biekell's correction of this verse, "That thy confidence may be in Jehovah, to make known unto thee thy ways;" but the alteration seems arbitrary and unnecessary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20</a></div><div class="verse">Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge?</span> There is a difficulty about the word tendered "excellent things." The Khetib has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "the day before yesterday, formerly;" but the word occurs nowhere alone, and, as Nowack says, can hardly have been the original reading. However, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, adopting it, suppose that the author refers to some earlier work. Cheyne cites Bickell's rendering, "Now, years before now, have I written unto thee long before with counsels and knowledge," and considers the words to mean either that the compiler took a long time over his work, or that this was not the first occasion of his writing. One does not see why stress should be here laid on former instruction, unless, perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, in contrast to "this day" of the previous verse. The LXX. renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> thus, "And do thou record them for thyself triply for counsel and knowledge upon the table of thine heart." St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter, in cogitationibus et scientiis.</span> Other versions have also given a numerical explanation to the term. In it is seen an allusion to the three supposed works of Solomon - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles - which is absurd; others refer it to the threefold division of the Testament - Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa; others, to three classes of youths for whom the admonitious were intended; others, again, think it equivalent to "oftentimes," or "in many forms." But the reading is as doubtful as the explanations of it are unsatisfactory. The genuine word is doubtless preserved in the Keri, which gives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shalishim</span>), properly a military term, applied to chariot fighters and men of rank in the army. The LXX. translates the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>), which is equivalent to "chieftain." Hence the Hebrew term, understood in the neuter gender, is transferred to the chief among proverbs - "choice proverbs," as Delitzsch calls them. The Venetian, by a happy turn, gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Thus we come back to the rendering of the Authorized Version as meet correct and intelligible.

Septuagint, "I therefore teach thee a true word and knowledge good to learn." <span class="cmt_word">That thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee.</span> This implies that the pupil will be enabled to teach others who apply to him for instruction; "will be ready." as St. Peter says, "always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>). But the last expression is better translated, "them that send thee;" <span class="accented">illis qui miserunt te</span>, Vulgate (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>); and we must conceive of these as being parents or tutors who send a youth to a school or wise man to be educated. The moralist expresses his desire that the disciple will carry home such wholesome, truthful doctrines as will prove that the pains expended upon him have not been useless. Septuagint, "That thou mayest answer words of truth to those who put questions to thee (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)" The Syriac adds, "That I may make known unto thee counsel and wisdom."

The Law endeavoured to mitigate this penalty (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12, 13</a>). But doubtless its merciful provisions were evaded by the moneylenders (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-12.htm">Ezekiel 18:12</a>, "hath not restored the pledge").

(On the sanctity of landmarks, see note on Proverbs 15:25.) Some of the stones, exhibiting a bilingual inscription, which marked the boundaries of the Levitical city of Gezer, were discovered by Gauneau in 1874 ('Quart. Statement Pal. Explor. Fund,' 1874).
