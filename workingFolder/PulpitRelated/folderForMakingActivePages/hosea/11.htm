The prophet goes back to that early period when the national life of Israel was in its infancy; it was then that a few patriarchs who had gone down to sojourn in Egypt were becoming a people; the predicate precedes, to emphasize, that early day when Israel became God's peculiar people. The <span class="accented">ray</span> marks the apodosis recording God's love in choosing that people, calling them into the relation of sonship, and delivering them out of Egypt. <span class="accented">Thus</span> Kimchi says, "When Israel was vet a child, <span class="accented">i.e. in</span> Egypt, then I loved him, therefore I am more angry with them than with the rest of the nations; for from their youth onward I have loved them, and delivered them out of the bands of their enemies. But when they transgress my commandments it is incumbent on me to chastise them as a man chastises his son." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The people of Israel is called God's son in consequence of God choosing them and bringing them into close relationship to himself, such as that of a son to a father. The commencement was the message to Pharaoh by Moses in the words, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn: and I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me." This sonship was solemnly ratified by the giving of the Law at Sinai; and the condition clearly stated that, in the event of their preserving the knowledge of God, fulfilling his Law, and doing his will, they would at all times enjoy Divine protection, defense, and blessing, while from generation to generation they were addressed by that honorable title. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As the deliverance hem Egypt is always described as a "leading" or "bringing out," and never elsewhere as a "calling out," some expositors maintain that the words, "out of Egypt," signify from the time Israel was in Egypt, and are parallel to "when Israel was a child," both referring to time, the time of national infancy. From that period God began to manifest his love, and in its manifestation he called him by the endearing name of "son" - my son. The words of this verse are applied by St. Matthew to the sojourn of  Jesus in Egypt. The older interpreters refer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the first part of the verse to Israel and the second part typically to the history of Messiah's childhood, in whom that of Israel reached its completeness. Rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the verse was applied typically to Israel, and to Jesus as the antitype; to the former primarily, and to the latter secondarily. Thus the head and the members are comprehended in one common prediction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Adverting to his own call mentioned in the first verse, God here refers to the many subsequent calls which he addressed to them through his servants the prophets and other messengers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The subject of the verb is erroneously understood by some, as, for example, Aben Ezra and Eichhorn, to be the idols, or their false priests or prophets; while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome is also mistaken in referring the words to the time of Israel's rebelling when Moses and Aaron wished to lead them out of Egypt. The correct reference is that first stated, and the sense is that, instead of appreciating the invitations and monitions of the prophets of God, they showed their utter insensibility and thanklessness, turning away from them in contempt and scorn. Nay, the more the messengers of God called them, the more they turned a deaf ear to those who were their truest friends and best advisers. Pursuing their idolatrous practices, they sacrificed to Baal, that is to say, the various representations of that idol, and burned incense to their images, whether of wood or stone or precious metal. Thus Kimchi correctly comments as follows: "The prophets which I sent to them called to them morning and evening to turn to Jehovah, so (much the more) did they go away from them, not hearkening to their words nor desisting from their evil works." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, even so, denoting the measure or relation, corresponds to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span> to be supplied in the first clause. The imperfects imply continuance of action or a general truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Septuagint rendering, followed by the Syriac, is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, "from my presence: they;" as if they had read on <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> instead of the present text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-3.htm">Hosea 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I taught Ephraim also to fro, taking them by their alms; but they knew not that I healed them.</span> This picture of God's guiding and guarding care of Ephraim is very touching and tender. It is that of an affectionate parent or tender nurse teaching a child to walk by leading-strings; taking it up in the arms when stumbling or making a false step; and in case it fell curing the wound. Thus, nurse-like, God taught Ephraim, his wayward perverse child, to use his feet (so the original word imports), all the while lending considerate help and seasonable aid. He took them by the hand to guide them, that they might not stray; he took them in his arms to hold them up, that they might not stumble and to help them over any obstacle that might lie in the way; and when, left to themselves during a short season, and in order to test their strength, they did stumble and fall, he healed their hurt. And yet they did not apprehend nor appreciate God's gracious design and dealings with them in thus guiding and guarding them, and in healing their diseases both temporal and spiritual. There is, perhaps, an allusion to <a href="../../par/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee." This promise, it will be remembered, was vouchsafed immediately after the bitter waters of Marah had been sweetened by the tree which, according to Divine direction, had been cast therein. Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">And</span> they have not acknowledged that I healed them of every sickness and every affliction, as he said, 'I will put none of these diseases upon thee.'" The reference is rather to all those evidences of his love which God manifested to them during their forty years' wandering in the wilderness; or perhaps to his guidance of them by 'his Law throughout their entire history. Rashi remarks that "they knew it very well, but dissembled [literally, 'trod it down with the heel,' equivalent to 'despised'] and acted, as if they did not know." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is properly taken both by Kimchi and Gesenius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>; the former says; "The <span class="accented">tar</span> stands in place of <span class="accented">he:</span> this is the opinion of the grammarians;" the latter regards it as a solitary example of Tiphel; others again consider it a corrupt reading instead of the ordinary form of Hiph. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some take it for a noun, as J. Kimchi, who says it is "a noun after the form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>, and although the word is Milel (while in <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> it is Milra), yet it is the same form;" thus the translation is, "As for me, my guidance was to Ephraim;" so Jerome, "I have been as a nurse to Ephraim;" likewise also Cyril. The former explanation is simpler and also otherwise preferable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint has the incorrect rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "I bound the feet of Ephraim," which Jerome explains, "I bound the feet of Ephraim that they might not fly further from me," though his own rendering is that given above. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span> has also occasioned some difficulty and consequent diversity of explanation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some explain it to be an infinitive construct equivalent to the Latin gerund indo, as elsewhere. Thus in the Authorized Version it is "taking them by their arms;' but the common form of the infinitive of this verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; besides, the suffixes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> are contradictory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Olshausen and Ewald read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> in the first person, the received text having, according to the latter, maintained its place only through <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>; but this is conjectural and wants manuscript authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Still worse is Abarbanel's interpretation, who understands the subject of the verb and the suffix of the noun as referring to Ephraim; thus: "He (Ephraim) took them (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the idols) on his arms." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The correct explanation, as we think, is that of Kimchi and Gesenius, who take the verb for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> by a not unusual aphaeris of the <span class="accented">lamed:</span> "He took them in his arms," the transition from the first to the third person being justified by the pictorially descriptive style of the passage. The following comment of Kimchi is worthy of attention: "The prophet only mentions Ephraim (instead of all Israel), because it was he that made the calves. He says, 'And how does Ephraim reward me for this that I bestowed on them so many benefits, and accustomed them to go on their feet, and did not burthen them with my commandments and my service?' And because he has compared Ephraim to a boy, he uses the word, 'I led them by strings.' Just as one leads a boy that he may accustom himself to go little by little without trouble, so I led them from station to station, when I brought them out of Egypt; I led them gradually without overexertion, the cloud going before them by day, and the pillar of fire by night." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love.</span> This verse contains a further representation of Jehovah's fatherly guidance of Israel. The <span class="accented">cords of a man</span> are such as parents use in leading weak or young children. <span class="accented">Bands of lore</span> qualify more closely the preceding expression, "cords of a man," and are the opposite of those which men employ in taming or breaking wild and unmanageable animals. The explanation of Rashi is similar: "I have always led them with tender cords such as these with which a man leads his child, as if he said with loving guidance." Aben Ezra and Kimchi, in their explanations, carry out more fully the same idea. The former says, "The bands of love are not like the bands which are fastened on the neck of a plowing heifer;" the latter, "Because he compared Ephraim to a heifer, and people lead a heifer with cords, he says, 'I have led Israel by the cords of a man, and not the cords of a heifer which one drags along with resistance, but as a man draws his fellow-man without compelling him to go with resistance: even so I have led them after a gentle method;' and therefore he afterward calls them (cords of a man) bands of love." The LXX., taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, in the sense of" injure," "destroy," have the mistaken rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, "When men were destroyed I drew them." The other Greek versions have the correct rendering. <span class="cmt_word">And I was to them as they that take off the yoke.</span> The word <span class="accented">herim</span> does not mean "to lift up on" and so "impose a yoke," as some think, nor "to take away the yoke," but "to lift it up." The figure is that of a humane and compassionate husbandman raising upwards or pushing backwards the yoke over the cheeks or dewlaps of the ox, that it may not press too heavily upon him or hinder him while eating. The reference is, according to Kimchi, to "taking the yoke off the neck, and letting it hang on the jaw, that it may not pull but rest from labor one or more hours of the day." The fact thus figuratively expressed is, not the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, but the loving-kindness of Jehovah in lightening the fulfillment of the Law to Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. omit the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, yoke, and strangely translates the clause, "I will be to them as a man smiting (another) on the cheeks." <span class="cmt_word">And I laid meat unto them.</span> The older and many modern interpreters, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> as the first person future apoc., Hiph., from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d8;&#x5d7;</span>, translate, "And I reached them food to eat," namely, the manna in the wilderness. This would require <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, which some substitute for the present reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald, Keil, and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d8;</span> as an adverb in the sense of" gradually," "gently," translating, "And gently towards him did I give him feral," or "I gently fed him." Some, again, as Kimchi, take <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> as a noun, after the form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>; and others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> take it to be an anomalous form for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, the first person future Hiph., like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-8.htm">Jeremiah 46:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In this clause also the Septuagint, probably reading as follows: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, translates, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I will have respect to him; I will prevail with him." Continuing the several clauses of this verse, we may express the meaning of the whole as follows: "Cords of a man" denote humane methods which Jehovah employed in dealing with and drawing his people - not such cords as oxen or other animals are drawn by; while "bands of love" is a kindred expression, explaining and emphasizing the former, and signifying such leading-strings as those with which a parent lovingly guides his child. The means employed by God for the help, encouragement, and support of his people were kind as they were bountiful. His benevolent and beneficent modes of procedure are further exhibited by another figure of like origin; for just as a considerate and compassionate man, a humane husbandman, gives respite and relief to the oxen at work by loosening the yoke and lifting it up off the neck upon the cheeks; and thus affords not only temporary rest and ease, but also allows an occasional mouthful or more of food, or even abundant provender, to the animal which toils in the yoke while plowing or at other work; so Jehovah extended to Israel, notwithstanding their frequent acts of unfaithfulness, his sparing mercy and tender compassions, supplying them in abundant measure with all that they needed for the sustenance and even comforts of life. Thus their sin in turning aside to other gods, which were no gods, in quest of larger benefits and more liberal support and succor, was all the more inexcusable. The next three verses (5-7) describe the severe chastisement Israel incurred by ingratitude for, and contempt of, the Divine love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-5.htm">Hosea 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</span> These words sound like an announcement that the season of Divine grace, so long extended to that sin-laden people, had at length expired; and that on account of their stubborn and on-grateful rebellion against Jehovah they would be forced, to go into exile and become subject to the monarch of Assyria. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They had been threatened with a return to Egypt and its bondage in <a href="../../par/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>, "They shall return to Egypt;" and <a href="../../par/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, "Ephraim shall return to Egypt;" vet now God, without any change of purpose, changes his mode of procedure, not allowing them to return to Egypt, but dooming them to a worse bondage under the Assyrians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Having been tributary to Assyria from the time of Menahem, they had revolted and applied to Egypt for help; now, however, no help would be permitted to come from Egypt nor even an opportunity of applying for it allowed. The power of Assyria would be paramount; instead, therefore, of native kings and Egyptian auxiliaries, Israel would have to submit to that iron yoke. However desirous of returning to Egypt, they would have neither the power nor the privilege of doing so. And this poor privilege of a choice of masters they were refused as a just retribution, because they had not repented of their sin and returned to God. Various methods have been resorted to, to harmonize the apparent contradiction alluded to, that is, between the affirmative and negative statements about Israel's return into Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Dathe, Eichhorn, and De Wette agree with the LXX. in reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, and connecting it with the preceding verse; but the other versions, as well as the manuscripts, support the received text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome and Rosenm&uuml;ller explain it of the people's desire to conclude an alliance with Egypt in order to throw off the yoke of Assyria, being frustrated by the superior power of the latter; thus the sense is that they shall not return any more to Egypt, as they had lately done by their ambassadors, to seek help from that land or its people. Then he assigns the reason why they would not again send ambassadors to Egypt for the purpose indicated, because the Assyrian alone would be their king. The objection to this is that <span class="accented">lo yashubu</span> must refer to the whole people rather than to their ambassador going to and fro between the countries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ewald, Maurer, and others cut the knot by taking <span class="accented">lo</span> interrogatively, as if it were <span class="accented">halo</span>, and thus equivalent to an affirmative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">Shall</span> they not return to Egypt and the Assyrian be their king?" The expected answer would be in the affirmative. Neither grammar nor context sanctions this interrogative sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> According to Hitzig, Keil, Simson, and others, we are to understand Egypt in the previous places, viz. <a href="../../par/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a> and <a href="../../par/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, as <span class="accented">received</span> of the land of bondage, where in the present passage the typical sense is inadmissible, owing to the contrast with Assyria. Into Egypt Israel should not return, lest the object of the Exodus might seem frustrated, but a worse lot lay before them - another and harder bondage awaited them; the King of Assyria would be their king and reign over them, and all because of their impenitence and refusal to return to Jehovah. The following is the explanation of Kimchi: "They should not have returned to the land of Egypt to seek help; I had already said to them, 'Ye shall henceforth return no more that way;' for if they had returned to me, they would not have needed help from Egypt. And against their will Assyria rules over them, and they serve him and send him a present year by year. And why is all this? Because they refused, etc.; as if he said (they refused) to return to me; for if they had returned to me, foreign kings (literally, 'kings of the nations') would not have ruled ever them, but they would have ruled over the nations as they had done in the days of David and Solomon, when they did my will; and so have I assured them, 'Thou shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.'" The root of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span> is cognate with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5e2;</span>, to hold back, refuse; the <span class="accented">le</span> strengthens the connection of the objectival infinitive with the governing verb; the ellipsis of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;</span> is obvious.

Nay, they could not free themselves from invasion and attack. The sword of war would whirl down upon their cities and consume the branches, that is, the villages, or the city bars, or the strong warriors set for defense. Some understand the word so variously interpreted in the sense of "liars," and refer it to the prophets, priests, and politicians who spake falsehood and. acted deceitfully.

Again, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is, as already intimated, variously rendered. The most appropriate translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> is (literally, "<span class="accented">poles</span> for carrying the ark," <a href="../../par/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13</a>) "<span class="accented">bolts</span> or bars" for securing gates, the root being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;</span>, to separate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Some explain it as a figure for "<span class="accented">mighty</span> men;" so Jerome and the Targum, as also Rashi: "It destroys his heroes and consumes them." this is the meaning of the word preferred by Gesenius. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Ewald understands it in the sense of "fortresses," especially on the frontier, by which a land is shut against or opened to the enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi take it to mean "branches," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> villages, and are followed by the Authorized Version. "The explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>," <span class="accented">says</span> Kimchi, "is ' branches,' and it is a figure for villages, for he had already mentioned his cities; and villages are related to cities as branches to a tree; in like manner they are called ' daughters,' being related to a city as daughters to a mother." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The LXX. render it by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, as also the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">Because of their own counsels</span>. The cause of all their calamitous invasions, which city gates barred and bolted could not shut out, was their evil counsels in departing from the Lord, as Kimchi correctly explains: "All this comes upon them in consequence of their evil counsel, because they have forsaken my service to serve other gods." Rashi draws attention to the peculiarity of the accentuation - tasha and sellug - to separate it from the preceding word. The Septuagint here again blunders, obviously reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and translating, "And shall eat (the fruit) of their evil counsel."

With all their sinfulness and shortcomings, Israel was still the people of God - my <span class="accented">people</span>; they were guilty of the sin of backsliding, and of backsliding from God, the best of benefactors and their chief good. Nor was it occasionally and after long intervals of time that they backslided; it was their habit, their tendency. They were suspended on, or rather fastened on, backsliding. <span class="cmt_word">Though they called them to the Most High, none at all would exalt him</span>; margin, <span class="accented">together they exalted him not</span>. This second clause signifies either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the prophets called Israel from their idols to the Host High, yet none exalted him (literally, "together they did not or would not exalt him") by abandoning their idols and abstaining from backsliding; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "though they call him (Israel) upwards, yet not one of them all will lift himself up," that is, they together - one and all - refused or neglected to lift themselves upward towards God or goodness. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, so that it signifies, according to Keil, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "suspended," "hung up, hanging fast upon," "impaled on; ' Hengstenberg, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "swaying about from inconstancy," and "in danger of falling away;" but Pusey seems to combine both in the original sense of the word, and explains it as follows: "Literally, hung to it! as we say, 'a man's whole being <span class="accented">hangs</span> on a thing.' A thing <span class="accented">hung to</span> or on another sways to and fro within certain limits, but its relation to that on which it is hung remains immovable, Its power of motion is restrained within these limits. So Israel, so the sinner, however he veer to and fro in the details and circumstances of his sin, is fixed and immovable in his adherence to his sin itself." Though Rashi and the Targum of Jonathan make <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span> as synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;</span>, thus: "When the prophets teach them to return to me, they are in suspense whether <span class="accented">to return</span> or not to return; with difficulty do they return to me," - they are, however, distinguished as turning away from and turning to <span class="accented">God - aversion frets</span> anal <span class="accented">conversion to him</span>; while the suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span> is objective, that is, "My people are hung to apostatizing from me." The phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is variously interpreted, by some as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "upwards," the prophets being the subject; thus Rashi: "To the matter that is above him (Israel) the prophets call him unitedly; but my people do not lift themselves up nor desire to do it." Corruption was so deeply seated in Israel, that the idle mass gave no response to the voice of the prophets urging them upwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi both take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> as an adjective, and synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, the Most High. Kimchi explains as follows: "He says, My people oscillate between distress and freedom; sometimes distress comes upon them, and again they are in the condition of freedom, and this takes place for their <span class="accented">backsliding</span> from me, as if he said, because of the backsliding and rebellion which they practice against me... The prophets call them constantly to return to <span class="accented">God most high</span>." So Aben Ezra: "The interpretation is, the callers call him <span class="accented">to the Most High</span>, and they are the prophets of God; but they all in one way raise not the head." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome takes it for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, a yoke, and renders accordingly: "But a yoke shall be imposed on them together, that is not taken away." The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;</span> signifies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to Gesenius and many others, "to celebrate with praises," or "extol." It is rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "to lift one's self up," "rise upwards;" nor is it necessary with this sense to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;</span>, his head, with Grotius, nor yet to understand it written for or in the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, with Joseph Kimchi. Similarly the Syriac: "They call him to God, but they think together, conspire, and do not raise themselves." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d3;</span> is "all together," and therefore <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> is "no one." The LXX. translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the second clause as follows: "But God shall be angry with his precious things, and shall not at all exalt <span class="accented">him</span>," having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? <i>how</i> shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? <i>how</i> shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim?</span> This verse paves the way for transition to promise. Although the Israelites on account of such conduct had merited complete annihilation, yet Jehovah, for his love and mercy's sake, substitutes grace for justice, and will not destroy them from off the face of the earth. One rendering <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> gives the clause the turn of an exclamation rather than of an interrogation; thus: "How readily and justly could I [or should I, or how thoroughly could I if I punished thy rebellion as I deserved] give thee up to destruction!" We prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the ordinary rendering, by which it is treated as a question: "How shall I give thee up to the power of the enemy, and not only that, but destroy thee?" Calvin's exposition seems indeed to favor the former: "Here," he says, "God consults what he is to do with the people; and first, indeed, he shows that it was his purpose to execute vengeance such as the Israelites deserved, even wholly to destroy them; but yet he assumes the character of one deliberating, that none might think that he hastily fell into anger, or that, being soon excited by excessive fury, he devoted to ruin those who had lightly sinned, or were guilty of no great crimes By these expressions of the text God shows what the Israelites deserved, and that he was now inclined to inflict the punishment of which they were worthy, and yet not without repentance, or at least not without hesitation. He afterwards adds in the next clause, <span class="accented">This I will not do</span>; <span class="accented">my heart is within me changed</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together</span>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, literally, "upon," "with," then, "in," or "within:" "My heart is turned or changed from anger to pity in me." The expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, signifies, according to Rashi, "one <span class="accented">warmed</span>," as in <a href="../../par/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>, where this same word is rendered in the Authorized Version," yearned:" "His bowels did yearn upon his brother," or "warmed towards." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> many modern interpreters understand the word in the sense of" gathering themselves together:" "<span class="accented">The</span> feelings of compassion gathered themselves together;" <span class="accented">nichumim</span>, from Piel <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, a noun of the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, less definite than <span class="accented">rachamim</span>, bowels, as the seat of the emotions, "<span class="accented">gathered</span> themselves together," or "were excited all at once." The cities of the plain included Admah and Zeboim, Sodom and Gomorrah, all of which, in consequence of their sins, were overthrown and perished in one common calamity. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> these cities are all named, though Admah and Zeboim are not mentioned by name in the narrative of the catastrophe contained in Genesis. Though Israel had been as guilty and deserving of wrath as these, God expresses strong reluctance to deliver them over into the hands and power of their enemies, or to give them up to destruction. His heart revolted at the thought, and turned aside from the fierceness of his anger, though so fully deserved, into the direction of mercy; a new turn was given to his feelings in the direction of compassion. All his relentings or repentings together - one and all - yearned or were at once aroused. Repenting on the part of God is an expression suited to human comprehension, implying no change of purpose on the side of God, but only a change of procedure consistent with his purpose of everlasting love. "The Law speaks in the language of the sons of men." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a></div><div class="verse">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I <i>am</i> God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim.</span> The promise of this verse is in harmony with the spirit of compassion expressed in the preceding. It is at once the effect and evidence of that feeling of Divine compassion. God would neither execute the burning heat of his wrath, for so the words literally mean, nor destroy Ephraim utterly, or again any more as formerly. The historic event referred to may be the destruction effected by Tiglath-pileser, ally of Ahaz King of Judah against Pekah King of Israel and Rezin King of Syria, when he carried away captive the inhabitants of Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali, as we read in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>, "In the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazer, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria." But while this is probably the primary allusion, there is an ulterior reference to the future restoration of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">For I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city</span> (or, <span class="accented">come into bumming wrath</span>, Keil). A reason is here assigned for the exercise of the Divine com<span class="accented">miseration</span> just expressed; this reason is God's covenant of everlasting love. He is God, and must be measured by a Divine standard - not man, implacable and revengeful; though his people's provocation had been grievous, God was in the midst of them as their God, long-suffering and steadfast to his covenant of love and purposes of mercy. He would not enter <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> into the city as an enemy, and for the purpose of utter destruction, as he had entered into the cities of the plain for their entire and final ruin; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> if the alternative rendering be preferred, he would not come into burning wrath. The fiery heat or fierceness of God's wrath tends to destruction, not the amendment of the impenitent. The expression, "I will not return," may also be understood as equivalent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "I will not turn from my pity and promises;" or, "I will not turn away from Israel;" but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it suits the context better to translate on the principle of two verbs expressing one idea in a modified sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will not return to destroy," that is, "I will not again destroy Ephraim." Jerome's explanation favors the first, and is, "I will not act according to the fury of my anger, nor change from my clemency to destroy Ephraim; for I do not strike to destroy for ever, but to amend... for I am God and not man. Man punishes for this purpose of destroying; God chastises for the purpose of amending." As God, his purpose of mercy was changeless; as the Holy One in Israel, he was infinitely pure and absolutely perfect, "the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning." The meaning <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> already given of coming into the city is supported by ancient versions, Hebrew expositors, and some of the ablest Christian commentators; yet <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> we prefer that which understands <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> in the sense of "the heat of wrath," deriving it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> effervescence, which is that given in Keil's translation. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> an explanation strongly advocated by Bishop Lowth and adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller. It is as follows in the words of the bishop: "Jerome is almost singular in his explanation: 'I am not one of those who inhabit cities; who live according to human laws; who think cruelty justice.' Castalio follows Jerome. There is, in fact, in the latter member of the sentence, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, a parallelism and synonym to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> in the former. The future <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> has a frequentative power (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a> and 8), 'I am not accustomed to enter a city: I am not an inhabitant of a city.' For there is a beautiful opposition of the different parts: 'I am God, and not man.' This is amplified in the next line, and the antithesis a little varied: ' I am thy God, inhabiting with thee, but in a peculiar and extraordinary manner, not in the manner of men.' Nothing, I think, can be plainer or more elegant than this." The bishop's rendering of the whole verse is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I will not do according to the fervent of my wrath,<br />I will not return  to destroy Ephraim:<br />For I am God, and not man;<br />Holy in the midst of thee, though I inhabit not thy cities."</span>

But this necessitates a double ellipsis of "<span class="accented">after</span> which." They would go after the Lord in obedience to his summons. That summons is represented as far-reaching and terrible. Calling his people to return, the Lord roars as a lion, to denote at once the loudness of the call, and the awful majesty of the Lord when thus calling his people to return. "<span class="accented">As</span> a lion," says Kimchi, "<span class="accented">which</span> roars that the animals whose king he is may assemble to him, so the Israelites shall assemble on hearing the voice of the Lord when he roars." The roaring of the lion may signify his terrible judgments on Israel's enemies, when he calls his people home from the lands of their dispersion.  The result would be a speedy return of his children from the lands of the West - the countries round or beyond the Mediterranean.

The trembling here is eager haste, or precipitate agitation, in which they would hurry home, and that from west and east and south - from west as we infer from ver. 10, from Assyria in the east and Egypt in the south. They would thus hurry as a bird home to its nest in the greenwood; as a dove no longer a silly dove, but flying home to its window. This chapter is regarded by some as ending here. Others include ver. 12.
