A general summary of all David's wars is given in ch. 8, and it was probably after he had subdued the Philistines and Moab, and his throne was now fully established, that in some time of peace, possibly before Hanun forced him into wars which won for him an empire, David sent for Nathan, and told him his full desire. Its position here immediately after the account of the bringing of the ark to Zion has a higher unity than that of chronology. It shows that David had always a larger purpose than the mere placing of the ark in its feint; and, as soon as a period of tranquillity arrived, he confided his thoughts to the prophet. Thus, with only one step taken towards his whole plan, David exercised a wise moderation in leaving the service at Gibeon unmolested. As regards the word "rest," we have to distinguish between the first series of wars, which established David firmly on his throne, and the second series, which gave him widespread dominion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A house of cedar;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">cedars.</span> As these trees were sent by Hiram, and as the house was built, and David now settled in it, some considerable time must have elapsed since his accession. Moreover, the league with Hiram would be the result of David's successes recorded in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>; for the bond of union between the two was their mutual fear of the Philistines. As we have seen before, the alliance with Tyro had a very civilizing effect upon the Hebrews, who were far inferior to the Tyrians in the mechanical arts; and David's house of hewn cedar logs was marvellous in the eyes of a people who still dwelt chiefly in tents. David purposed to build even a more sumptuous palace for Jehovah, and advised with Nathan as his chief counsellor, and the person to whom subsequently the education of Solomon was confided. <span class="cmt_word">Within curtains;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the curtain</span>; that is, the tent. The tabernacle prepared by Moses for the ark was formed of ten curtains (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>), but the significance lay, not in their number, but in the dwelling of Jehovah still being a mere temporary lodging, though his people had received from him a settled land. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-3.htm">2 Samuel 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for the LORD <i>is</i> with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go, do all that is in thine heart.</span> Nathan rashly approves. The king's purpose seems so pious that he does not doubt its acceptance by God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word of Jehovah came unto Nathan.</span> Not every word of a prophet was inspired, and only a very few of the prophets, and those only upon great and solemn occasions, spake under the direct influence of the Spirit of God. In his usual relations with the king, Nathan was simply a wise, thoughtful, and God-fearing man. In giving his approval he probably meant no more than that a permanent dwelling for Jehovah was what all pious men were hoping for. But from the days of Samuel to those of Ezra, there was never wanting one or even more holy men who were, on fit occasions, commissioned to bear a message from God to man; and as these generally belonged to the prophetic order, men too often now confound prophecy with prediction. So inveterate is this confusion that even in the Revised Version Amos is made to say, "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son," whereas the Hebrew distinctly is, "I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son [that is, one trained in the prophetic schools], but I am a herdsman" (<a href="../../par/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a>). But though not a prophet by profession, yet Amos was discharging a prophet's higher duty in testifying against wickedness and impiety, and was acting under a special Divine call. Still, he did not belong to the prophetic order, nor wear the garment of black camel's hair, which was their professional dress. On the present occasion, Nathan, in approving, had spoken as a man, but now a Divine message comes to him. How we know not. but in ver. 17 it is called a "vision;" and it is also said that it came "that night." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou, etc.?</span> The question implies an answer in the negative; but there is no disapproval of David's purpose as such; but only the deferring of its full execution unto the days of his son. There is more than this. The idea which runs through the Divine message is that the dwelling of Jehovah in a tent was a fitting symbol of Israel's unquiet possession of the laud. It was David's mission to give them tranquillity and security in the region which they had conquered long ago, but wherein they had never hitherto been able to maintain their liberty unimpaired. Then, upon the accomplishment of David's special duty, his son, Shelomo, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the peaceful, was to build the solid temple, as the proof that Jehovah had now taken permanent possession of the land. We find also a further thought, namely, that the building of the temple  signified "the making for David of a house." In its full significance this means that the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David were now chosen by God as the ancestors of the Messiah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-6.htm">2 Samuel 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">Whereas I have not dwelt in <i>any</i> house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have walked continually</span>; that is, I have ever been a wanderer, first, in the wilderness, and subsequently at Gilgal, Shiloh, Nob, and Gibeon. Instead of a "tabernacle," the Hebrew has a "dwelling." This may refer to the houses of Abinadab and Obed-Edom, but the words more probably signify "a tent that was my dwelling." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">In all <i>the places</i> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In all the places wherein I have walked;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">in all wherein I continued walking</span>; that is, in all my walking, in all the whole time wherein I have been a wanderer. Instead of <span class="accented">tribes</span>, the Chronicler (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-6.htm">1 Chronicles 17:6</a>) reads "judges," the words in the Hebrew being almost identical. "Judges" is, of course, the more easy and natural reading, but "tribes" gives a fuller sense, and is supported by all the versions. For in the troubled anarchy which lasted until Saul's reign, first one tribe and then another was called to the front, and had a temporary ascendancy; but neither did Jehovah give it any command to provide a settled place for his worship, nor did any one of the judges conceive the thought of making his tribe permanently the chief, by providing a fixed abode for the ark and for God's worship within its borders. <span class="cmt_word">To feed my people Israel.</span> The shepherd, in biblical language, is the ruler, and <span class="accented">to feed</span> is to govern, yet in a kindly way, going in front as the shepherd before his flock, to bear the brunt of danger, to clear the road, and to guide into the safe pastures. So tribe after tribe had been called to bear the brunt of war, and, after winning deliverance, it became its duty to guide and lead the people. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16, 18, 25</a>, and still more remarkably in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8, 9</a>, we find large additions made to the account here given. It follows that we have in this place only a brief summary of the message brought by Nathan, but one containing all the chief points. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I took thee from the sheepcote.</span> There is in Nathan's message a marked advance upon the words of all previous prophecies. Hitherto God's promises had been general, and no tribe, and much less any special person, had been chosen as the progenitor of the Messiah. The nearest approach to the selection of a tribe had been the prediction of Judah's supremacy until Shiloh came (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>); but it was not even there expressly declared that Shiloh should be of Judah's race. But now David is clearly chosen. Jehovah takes him from the sheepcote; Hebrew, "the meadow" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>). It was in the meadows, the Naioth, round Ramah, that Samuel had gathered the young men of Israel to study their ancient records, and raise their country to a sense of its high calling. In those meadows David had been formed for his high vocation; but he had returned from them to Bethlehem, to feed his father's sheep. And now, "from following the ewes that gave suck," Jehovah takes him to be "his servant," a word of high dignity, applied to but few persons in the Old Testament. It signifies the prime minister, or vicegerent of Jehovah, as the theocratic king, and is the special title of Moses among God's people, and, among the heathen, of Nebuchadnezzar, as one summoned to do a great work for God. But it is in the last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah that the title reaches its full grandeur. For there, first of all, Israel is called Jehovah's servant, because it was Israel's office to be the witness for the oneness of God amidst the debasing polytheism of all the nations round. And then, finally, the servant is Messiah, as being the personal Representative of God upon earth. The title is now given to David as the type of Christ's kingly office, and also as the sweet singer, who added a new service to the worship of God, and made it more spiritual, and more like the service of angels round God's throne. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great <i>men</i> that <i>are</i> in the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made thee a great name.</span> The widespread conquests of David, and his great empire, were not for the sake of mere earthly dominion. It was, first of all, a type of Messiah's reign, to whom God has premised the heathen for his inheritance, and that his gospel shall be carried to the ends of the earth. But, secondly, if Messiah was to be "David's Son," it was necessary that that king should hold a special place in the hearts of all Israelites. In the fables and tales of the Arabs, it is Solomon who holds the foremost place. Just as our forefathers showed the native qualities of the race by making Arthur's court the abode of prowess and chivalrous bravery; so the Arabs made Solomon's court the representative of that dazzling splendor and magnificence which they so admired; and invested him with superhuman knowledge and magical power, such as made janns and ifreets the humble slaves of his will. In the Old Testament no king is "Jehovah's servant" but David; no king is ever connected with Messiah but David. The religious fervent of the people may gather round a Hezekiah or a Josiah, and prophets may encourage them in their work; but no prophet sees in either of them the ancestor of Christ. It is, however, in the Psalms that we learn the full meaning of  Nathan's words. Here a veil is partly drawn over them. But it would be a wilful closing of the eyes to read this message and not bear in mind the clear light with which every word is illumined by the inspired outpouring of David's own heart. He thoroughly understood the fulness and blessedness of God's revelation, and has taught us that it all looked onward to Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover I will appoint... will plant.</span> For "moreover," the Hebrew has "and." The tenses also continue the same: "And I have appointed...  and have planted." It is all part of the same act. As regards the second verb, the past tense alone makes sense. Jehovah was not about to plant Israel in a place of their own, but had just done so completely. For David's kingdom had given them security, and with it the power of doing for God that duty which was Israel's special office in the world. Had the anarchy of the times of the judges continued, and the energies of the nation been spent in a hard struggle for existence, that rapid advance in literature which followed upon the institution of Samuel's schools, and which filled David's court with poets and chroniclers, never could have existed, and prophecy would have been impossible. The age of Hezekiah was apparently the culminating period of Hebrew civilization, after which came the depressing influences of the Assyrian invasions, and then long exile, followed by a second weary struggle for existence. If writing was at first a mystery and an art known only to priests, it became throughout the monarchy the possession especially of the prophets, who were Israel's learned men. At the head of their roll stands the matchless Isaiah, and to render it possible for his genius to display itself, not only Samuel's schools, but the security of David's era of conquest, and the long peace and magnificence of Solomon's reign, were all necessary. When "God had given David rest from his enemies round about," he had thereby finally appointed a place for Israel and had planted them there. There is, perhaps, some difficulty in the verb forms at the end of ver. 11, but none in the meaning. The reign of David marks an era in the national life. Under him Israel obtained secure possession of the place appointed for it; and now, having no longer to waste its energies in perpetual fighting, the national life grows upwards, and attains to culture, to thought, and civilization. Canaan is now their own, and instead of being mere warriors, they develop national institutions and a national character. What could men do that belongs to a higher and nobler life who were in daily fear of being swept away by Canaanites and Midianites, by Philistines and Ammonites? This miserable period is described as "beforetime," and as "since the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel." And here a colon should be placed; and the Hebrew will then proceed, "But now I have caused thee to rest from thine enemies, the anarchy and its attendant weakness is over; "and Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house." Rest has been given; the establishment of David's family as the Messianic lineage is to follow (see on this promise, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a></div><div class="verse">And as since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a></div><div class="verse">And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy seed...  which shall proceed.</span> As the son is to be established in the kingdom and to build the house, he must be Solomon, who plainly, therefore, was not as yet born (see note on ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a></div><div class="verse">He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> The temple which Solomon was to build was the symbol of the new development of Israel, and naturally these words suggest a meaning not unworthy of so great an advance in the accomplishment of the nation's mission. Had we, indeed, only this passage, we might be content to take it in a popular sense, as signifying that, whereas Saul's throne (and subsequently that of the many usurpers in Samaria) had but a brief existence, Solomon's descendants should hold for many centuries undisputed possession of the kingdom of Jerusalem. But in <a href="../../par/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a> we read, "His (David's) seed will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven." And again in vers. 36, 37 a continuance is assured to it as lasting as that of the sun and moon. We can scarcely, therefore, be wrong in the conviction that these promises pointed onwards to the establishment of Christ's kingdom, and that the great importance attached to the building of the temple finds its explanation in its relation to him. This full establishment after so long a delay of the Mosaic typical ritual, the addition to it of psalmody, giving it a spiritual side, and making the worship that of the heart, the bestowal of empire, and the rapid development of the people under David and Solomon, were all steps in that wonderful series of special providences which made the Jews fit to be the progeniters of the Messiah, which surrounded him during his ministry with companions capable of understanding and recording his teaching, and provided for him, after his death, missionaries, not merely with zeal enough, but with intellectual gifts sufficient to enable them to persuade both Greece and Rome to listen to tidings so wonderful and mysterious as that God for our salvation had become man. Keil also well points out that the temple was a symbol of Christ's  incarnation; for it meant the dwelling of God on earth. "I have surely," says Solomon, "built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in forever" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>). The same thought was in St. John's mind when he said, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt as in a tabernacle among us" (<a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). For the verb used by him, literally "tabernacled," is a comparison between Christ's life on earth, and the dwelling of God in "the tent of meeting." But there is more than this. Christ himself calls his body "the temple" (<a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19, 21</a>). At the Resurrection he raised up again the temple of his body which the Jews had destroyed, and at the Ascension it was removed from the earth, to be reserved in heaven until his second advent. His reign now is spiritual, and his temple is not a building made with hands, but is the heart of the renewed believer (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). And this indwelling of Christ in the heart will continue unto the end of the present dispensation. For Christ's indwelling is that also of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>); and the gift of the Spirit continues unto the end of the world. "The Father shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever" (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be his Father, and he shall be my son.</span> Between father and son there is not only love, but oneness. Whatsoever the father hath, that belongs also to the son by natural right. But this sonship is magnified in the Psalms beyond the measure of Solomon or any natural limits. The Son there is "the Firstborn," which Solomon was not, "higher than the kings of the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>); and he must have "the nations for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession" (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>). Psalms like the second and seventy-second belong, not to Solomon personally, but to him as the type of the prince of Peace; and they help to show us what is the true meaning and fulfilment of the words here. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of men;</span> that is, such punishment as men fitly receive for their faults. David's natural posterity was to be exempt neither from human depravity, nor from punishment, nor from the changes and chances of mortal life. With them, as with men generally, there would be a tangled skein, of virtue and sin, of folly and wisdom, of terrible fall and penitent recovery. But there was to be no blotting out of David's lineage. Great earthly houses, in the long course of events, one after another become extinct, and even the tabernacle of David was to fall (<a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>), but not forever. God would "raise up its ruins' in Christ, and "build it as in the days of old." So in <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> there is the same thought of the complete down-hewing of David's earthly lineage, yet only to rise again to nobler life and vigour, in the Branch, or Sucker, that was to spring from the fallen trunk. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-15.htm">2 Samuel 7:15</a></div><div class="verse">But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before thee.</span> This does not refer to time, but means "in thy presence," or "before thy face," that is, "as thou hast thyself been witness." There is a strong contrast between the fate of Saul's house and this eternal endurance promised to that of David. The lineage of Saul might have made a new start in Jonathan, and even when he died at Gilboa, he left a son behind him. Still, no one ever locked upon Mephibosheth as having any title to the throne; and though Shimei (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>) may have conceived the hope that, if David were overthrown, the kingdom might return to Saul's family, yet, as a matter of fact, among the many vicissitudes of the ten tribes, the attempt never was made to search for a descendant of Saul to be Israel's king. Saul's was a royalty for one generation; David's throne was to be established forever. Not because David was sinless. His character is sullied by crimes of the darkest hue. But he never sank into a mere tyrant, such as Saul was towards David and towards the priests at Nob. Nor did David ever become an irreligious man (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a>), though there is in him a strange and painful mixture of great good and great evil. The salt that preserves his character is his genuine sincerity and earnestness both towards God and man; and these qualities make him not unworthy of the high place he holds among God s people. Still, the premise was not because of David's deserts, but because from him was to come the Christ, who is blessed. forevermore.

This word does not imply that Nathan saw anything with the natural eye, but signifies that sort of prophecy which was vouchsafed to a "seer." Thus the prophecies of Isaiah, of Nahum, and of Obadiah are called "visions." Probably the word is taken from the fixed gaze, with which the seer looked into the far off world with unmoved eyes, yet seeing not with them, but with the spiritual sight within. It would thus be an intellectual process accompanied by a rigidity of the natural organs, caused partly by intensity of feeling, but chiefly by mental preoccupation, which left no faculty at liberty to discharge its ordinary function.

The rabbins give the word its ordinary meaning, and say that it was the privilege of kings to pray in a sitting posture. But we cannot possibly believe that kings at this early stage had established a special etiquette for observance in prayer, and the difficulty is  merely imaginary. Because the Jews prayed standing, and we moderns pray kneeling, we both assume that to pray sitting was an irreverent act. It was not so, nor are we to think of David as sitting at ease in a chair. He sat upon the ground, as was the Oriental custom, with his feet doubled under him, and his head bent forward; and in this posture meditated upon Jehovah's message, and then poured out his thoughts. As it is expressly said that "he sat before Jehovah," the place must have been the outer court of the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Who am I, O Lord Jehovah!</span> In the Authorized Version <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> is rendered "God," because it has the vowels of the word <span class="accented">Elohim</span>; usually it is rendered "Lord," because the Masserites attached to it the vowels of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, "lord," equivalent to <span class="accented">Dominus.</span> As <span class="accented">Adonai</span> here precedes <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the Massorites were driven from their usual practice, and were so superstitious as to suppose it more reverent to pronounce the name <span class="accented">Elohim</span> than that of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, to which the Jews attached magical powers. David's words are not so much a prayer as a meditation, full of thanksgiving, and even of wonder at the greatness of God's mercies to him. In it he first acknowledges his own unworthiness and the meanness of his father's house compared with the high dignity which God is bestowing upon him. For not only has he raised him to the kingly office, but promised him the continuance of his house "for a great while to come." Whether David understood as yet that he was now placed in the same position as Abraham of old, in that "in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed," is uncertain, and depends upon the interpretation put upon the following words. This only we may affirm, that whet he says in this place of his house remaining until a distant future falls far short of the meaning of the passages quoted above from the Psalms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-19.htm">2 Samuel 7:19</a></div><div class="verse">And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And <i>is</i> this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and this is the law of man, O Lord Jehovah.</span> In the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-17.htm">1 Chronicles 17:17</a>) the Hebrew has, "And thou hast regarded me according to the law of a man of high degree." The rendering of the Authorized Version here, which, by making the clause interrogative, implies a negative, gives absolutely no sense; but some commentators render, "And this is the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah," understanding thereby that God was acting towards David in a human manner, that is, as an earthly friend and benefactor would do. But though the Revised Version favours this rendering, the Hebrew word <span class="accented">torah</span> never has this meaning, and, unless, the attempt be made to amend the text, for which the versions give no help, we must take <span class="accented">torah</span> in its usual sense, and understand that this continuance of David's house into the distant future has now become a human law, that is, a divinely constituted ordinance, which must now take its place among the laws which govern human affairs. The words are undoubtedly difficult, and we feel that David was speaking in an ejaculatory manner, in sentences but half expressed, breaking forth from him bit by bit, under the pressure of deep excitement within. We notice too that, while there is no direct reference to the Messiah in David's words, yet that the Psalms indicate that he did connect the duration of his house with the Messiah's advent; and this ejaculation may have sprung forth, if not from a fully formed conviction, yet from the feeling that the permanence of his house was for the purpose of a higher kingdom than that of Jerusalem; and so the promise was a "law of man" and the promulgation of a decree which affected the whole human race. This may be the meaning of the Vulgate, which renders "a law of Adam," that is, one embracing within its scope all Adam's race, 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-20.htm">2 Samuel 7:20</a></div><div class="verse">And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, Lord. God, knowest thy servant.</span> The Hebrew throughout has <span class="accented">Lord Jehovah</span>, except in vers. 22, 25, where it has "Jehovah God," the title of Deity used in <a href="../../par/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>. The repeated use Of this covenant and personal name of God is very emphatic; and the appeal to Jehovah's knowledge of his heart reminds us of similar outpourings of David's consciousness of his sincere devotion to his Maker, as for instance in <a href="../../par/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-21.htm">2 Samuel 7:21</a></div><div class="verse">For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy word's sake;</span> In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a> we read, "For thy servant's sake." The phrase seemed, perhaps, to the Chronicler difficult, but it does not mean "because of thy previous promise," for no such promise had been given, but "because thou hast now said it." Nor does it imply pre-existing merit in David, but that God had now chosen to declare his will, and what was according to his own heart. It thus makes God's own good will and pleasure the cause of the great honours bestowed upon David. Instead of these great things, the Hebrew has <span class="accented">this great thing</span>; that is, the lasting continuance of David's family. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-22.htm">2 Samuel 7:22</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore thou art great.</span> God's goodness is to David a proof of his greatness, and he sees it displayed, not only in his dealings with himself, but also in the past history of the Jewish nation. There is in this a depth of evangelic piety. An unconverted heart would see the greatness of God in the majesty of creation, or in severe dealings with the impenitent. David saw it in acts of mercy and kindness.  We look upon Elijah as the very type of sternness, yet he too recognized the presence of God in "the still small voice" of gentleness and love (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a></div><div class="verse">And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people, <i>even</i> like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, <i>from</i> the nations and their gods?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And what one nation,</span> etc.? The translation should be, <span class="accented">And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation upon earth which God went to redeem for himself to be his people, and to make for him a name</span>, etc.? Israel both was and remains to this day a nation unique in its history, both in those early dealings of God with it, and also in its later history and its marvellous preservation unto this day. It is remarkable that in this place the word for "God," <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, is followed by a verb plural, the almost invariable rule in Hebrew being that, though <span class="accented">Elohim</span> is itself plural, it takes a verb singular whenever it refers to the true God. In the corresponding passage (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) the verb is in the singular. No adequate reason has been given for this deviation, but probably the usage in these early times was not so strict as it became subsequently. It is the influence of writing, and of the eye becoming conversant with writing, that makes men correct in their use of language and in the spelling of words. In the Syriac Church, God the Word and God the Holy Ghost were at first spoken of in the feminine gender, because "Word" and "Spirit" are both feminine nouns; but grammar soon gave way to soundness of thought and feeling. So probably in colloquial language <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was often used with a verb plural, but correct thinking forbade and overruled grammar. We may regard this, then, as one of the few passages in which the colloquial usage has escaped correction, and attach no further importance to it. <span class="cmt_word">For you.</span> "You" is plural, and refers to the people. The Vulgate has "for them," which is in accordance with the greater exactness of modern grammar. But sudden changes of person are very common in Hebrew, which follows the rules of thought rather than of written composition; and so David speaks of Israel as <span class="accented">you</span>, because they seemed to him to be present. We must note, however, that in the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">for thy land, and thy people,</span> the pronoun is singular, and refers to God. <span class="cmt_word">From the nations and their gods.</span> Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, by inserting "from," which is not in the Hebrew, take "nations" as in apposition with "Egypt;" but a moment's consideration shows that this is untenable, as "nations" is plural. But the whole verse is so full of grammatical difficulties as to make it extremely probable that the text is corrupt, and that we ought to supply the verb "to drive out," which is actually read in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>, or even to substitute it in the place of "for thy land," which is omitted in the parallel passage. The nations which God drove out had nothing to do with Egypt, but were the seven dominant tribes of Canaan; and the bestowal upon Israel of their territories was as essential a part of Jehovah's dealings with his people as the Exodus itself. Thus the reading will be, <span class="accented">To drive out before thy people, whom thou purchasedst for thee from Egypt, nations and their gods.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-24.htm">2 Samuel 7:24</a></div><div class="verse">For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel <i>to be</i> a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast confirmed.</span> The word means "thou hast firmly and securely established Israel to "be thy people." This plainly refers to [he settlement in Canaan, now at last completed by David's victories, and not to the deliverance from Egypt. In the words that follow David recognizes the spiritual importance, not only of the permanent continuance of his house, but also of the empire given unto him. For Israel is now to be <span class="cmt_word">a people forever: and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.</span> It is very necessary to retain here the personal name, Jehovah, as it is in the Hebrew, and not dilute it down to the <span class="accented">Lord</span> of the Septuagint. For now, to David's mind, the covenant seemed complete, and ratified forever. Israel is to have an everlasting existence - a promise belonging to it in its full sense only spiritually. For as long as the world lasts, it is against the spiritual Israel that the gates of hell shall never prevail. And next, first as the theocratic people, and then as the Church, it is to hold a unique relation to Jehovah, who is to be its God. For Israel, that is, the Jewish and the Christian Church, worships, not the God of nature, <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, but <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the God of grace; and they learn his attributes, not from philosophy, nor by metaphysical inquiry, but from his own revealed will, in which he teaches us what he is, what we are, and how we are to become one with him.

The special relation of Jehovah to Israel is throughout kept constantly in view; for Jehovah is the Name of Deity in covenant with his people, and it is in the confirmation and permanence of the covenant that David sees the true value of the lasting continuance of his own house.

Here it simply means "courage," as in,  <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-32.htm">1 Samuel 17:32</a>. The Revised Version puts this in the margin: "Therefore hath thy servant been bold to pray this prayer." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a></div><div class="verse">And now, O Lord GOD, thou <i>art</i> that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now, O Lord God, thou art that God.</span> The pronoun rendered "that" is really a personal pronoun used as the copula, which the Authorized Version inserts in italics. As this grammatical usage, which is common to all the Semitic languages, was not understood at the time when our version was made, we find all the parts of the verb "to be" constantly printed in italics, as though absent, while really they are expressed in the Oriental way. This has the advantage, however, of reminding the reader that wherever the verb "to be" is printed in Roman characters it has a much stronger meaning than the mere union of subject and predicate. Thus in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> the first "was," in Roman type, means "existed," or possibly "became;" the second "was," in italics, is simply the copula. Here the correct translation is, <span class="accented">And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art the God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the one real, true God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-29.htm">2 Samuel 7:29</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken <i>it</i>: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let it please thee to bless;</span> or, <span class="accented">begin and bless.</span> Literally, the verb signifies to make up the mind and set about the doing of the thing purposed. Thus David prays that the blessing may now at once begin to take effect. It is often rendered "please" in our version, because the verb is one used only of a determination resolved upon of the free will of the purposer. Its force is well seen in <a href="../../par/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>, where what Job prays for is that God would deliberate no longer, but decide the matter and set about destroying him. The Authorized Version was led, by the use of this verse "please," to adopt the optative form. Really, it is the language of firm faith, and should be rendered, <span class="accented">And now</span> [there is no "therefore"] <span class="accented">begin of thy own good will, and bless the house of thy servant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
