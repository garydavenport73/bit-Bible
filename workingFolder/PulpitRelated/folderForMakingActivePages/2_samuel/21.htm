And the LORD answered, <i>It is</i> for Saul, and for <i>his</i> bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was a famine in the days of David;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and there was.</span> There is an entire absence of any mark of time to show in what part of David's reign this famine took place. It does not even follow, from the mention of Mephibosheth's name, that it must have happened at a time subsequent to the sending for that prince from Machir's house; for it may have been the search after the descendants of Saul which made David remember the son of his old friend. The burial, however, of the bones of Saul and Jonathan as an act of respect to the slaughtered king makes it probable that the narrative belongs to the early part of David's reign, as also does the apparent fact that the seven victims were all young and unmarried. Mephibosheth, we read, had a young son when David sent for him. Now, he was five years old when his father was slain (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), and thus at the end of David's reign of seven years and a half at Hebron, he would be twelve and a half years of age. The famine lasted three years, and if David had been king four or five years when the famine began, Mephibosheth, at the age of twenty, might well have a "young son" in a country where men marry early. We cannot believe that the famine occurred long after David had been king of all Israel, because manifestly it would have been unjust and even monstrous to punish a nation for the sins of a king who had long passed away. The sins of its rulers are visited upon a nation constantly through a long series of years, but it is always in the way of natural development. A statesman may put a nation upon a wrong track, and may involve it in serious difficulties, and even in irretrievable disaster, unless some one be raised up able to make it retrace its steps and regain the rightful direction. But this famine was a direct interference of Providence, and to justify it the sin must be still fresh in the national remembrance. Had it been an old crime long ago forgotten, instead of leading men to repentance, this long and terrible punishment would have hardened men's hearts, and made them regard the Deity as vindictive. It is even probable that the sin was still being committed; for though commenced and approved by Saul, his oppression and purpose of gradually destroying the native races was too much in accord with men's usual way of acting not to be continued, unless stopped by the justice of the ruler. We all know how the Red Indian, the Bushman, the Maori, and the Australian disappear before the advance of the white man. It needs only apathy on the part of the government, and rougher methods for clearing them off are practised than men would care to own. So with Gibeonites and Perizzites and other native races, a similar process would be going on. The lands they held, their little villages, their pastures, and above all their strongholds, would be coveted by the dominant race, and entrenchments would lead to quarrels, in which the natives would find any resistance on their part punished as rebellion. Even David seized the hill fortress of Jebus for his capital, though he still left Araunah the nominal title of king (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-23.htm">2 Samuel 24:23</a>). Saul had lent all the weight of the royal authority to the extermination of the natives, and this chapter records the Divine condemnation of wrong done by the dominantrace to the aborigines. It remains to this day the charter for their protection, and not only forbids their extinction, but requires that they shall be treated with fair and even justice, and their rights respected and maintained. It has been objected that the execution of Saul's seven sons was a political crime committed to render David's throne secure. If at all to his advantage, it was so only to a very slight extent. The sons of Rizpah could never have become pretenders to the throne; nor were the sons of Merab likely to be much more dangerous. In a few years they would have married, and formed other ties, and been merged in the general population. Mephibosheth was the heir of Saul, and David protected him and Micha his son. It was quite in the spirit of the times to visit upon Saul's house the sins of its chief. The principle was the same as when all Israel stoned Achan, his sons and his daughters, his oxen and his asses, his sheep and his tent, for brining iniquity upon the people (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>). We keep chiefly in view the doctrine of personal responsibility; in the Old Testament the other doctrine of the collective responsibility of a family, a city, a nation, was made the more prominent It was the Prophet Ezekiel who in ch. 18. stated clearly and with Divine force that  "the soul that sinneth it shall die;" but that the sinner's son, if he walk in God's statutes, shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live. But the collective responsibility enacted in the second commandment is still God's law. In the philosophic jargon of our times the two factors which form human character and decide our fortunes are "heredity and environment." Heredity was the prevailing sentiment in David's days; and it seemed right to the Gibeonites that the sons of the man who had slaughtered them should die for their father's sins; and it seemed just to David also. But he spared the heir to Saul's throne. There is no adequate reason for supposing that David was influenced by political motives, and the more important lesson of the narrative is the emphatic condemnation given in it of wrong and cruelty to aboriginal tribes. <span class="cmt_word">David inquired of the Lord;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">David sought the face of Jehovah.</span> The phrase is remarkable, and not found elsewhere in Samuel. Probably it means that he went to Gibeon to pray in the sanctuary, and consult God by Urim and Thummim. His bloody house. The Hebrew means "the house on which rested the guilt of murder." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-2.htm">2 Samuel 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites <i>were</i> not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul sought to slay them in his zeal.</span> We gather from various incidental circumstances that Saul, in some part of his reign, manifested great zeal in an attempt to carry out literally the enactments of the Levitical Law; but he seems to have done so with the same ferocity as that which he displayed in slaughtering the priests at Nob with their wives and children. Thus he had put to death wizards and all who dealt with familiar spirits (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-9.htm">1 Samuel 28:9</a>), in accordance with <a href="../../par/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>. In the same way he seems to have tried to exterminate the aboriginal inhabitants of Palestine, in accordance with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, and had especially massacred a large number of Gibeonites, in violation of the covenant made with them by Joshua and all Israel (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 15-27</a>). And as he would thus acquire "fields and vineyards" robbed from them to give to his captains, his conduct was probably popular, and the cause of a general system of wrong and oppression practised upon all the natives. It had thus become a national sin, and as such was punished by a national calamity. Amorites; that is highlanders, mountaineers. Strictly they were Hivites (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>).

Literally the verb means to "cover up," the idea being that of a veil drawn over the offence to conceal it by means of a gift or offering. Thence gradually it attained to its religious idea of an expiation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-4.htm">2 Samuel 21:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, <i>that</i> will I do for you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No silver nor gold.</span> It is a common practice in most semi-civilized nations for a fine to be accepted as compensation for the shedding of blood. As no distinction was drawn between murder and homicide, and as the nearest relative was bound in every case to revenge the blood shed, the custom of receiving a money compensation gradually grew up to prevent the tribe or nation being torn to pieces by interminable revenge. The Arabs still retain this usage, but it was forbidden by the Levitical Law (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>), and rightly so, because a distinction was there made between murder and accidental bloodshed, and precautions taken for the rescue of one who had not acted with malice. <span class="cmt_word">Neither for us shalt thou kill any turn in Israel.</span> The singular is used at the beginning of their answer, in the same way as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-42.htm">2 Samuel 19:42, 43</a>. Literally their words are, <span class="accented">It is not to me a matter of silver and gold with Saul and his house, nor is it for us to put to death any one in Israel</span>; that is, "We refuse a money compensation, and it is beyond our power to exact the blood penalty which would gratify our anger." They make it quite plain that they do want blood, while the Authorized Version makes them say that they do not. The Revised Version more correctly translates, "Neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel."

But the Gibeonites were probably very barbarous, and, when David had delivered the seven lads into their hands, would perhaps wreak upon them a cruel vengeance. <span class="accented">Seven</span> were chosen, because it is the perfect number, with many religious associations; and <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord</span> means "publicly."

We have noticed a very flagrant instance before in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a>. The object of these mistranslations is always the same, namely, to remove some verbal discrepancy in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew says here "five sons of Michal, whom she bare to Adriel;" but Michal never bore a child, therefore something must be substituted which will save the Hebrew from this verbal inaccuracy, and Michal must be represented as having taken Merab's place (perhaps at her death), and been foster mother to her children. This explanation is, it is true, taken from the Jewish Targum; but the Targum never professes to be an exact translation, and constantly perverts the meaning of the plainest passages for preconceived reasons. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-9.htm">2 Samuel 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell <i>all</i> seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first <i>days</i>, in the beginning of barley harvest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The beginning of barley harvest.</span> The barley became ripe in April, about the time of the Passover (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>).

The word "upon" has led many commentators to suppose that she used it as a bed; but this is not the meaning of the Hebrew, though given by the Vulgate. The sackcloth was the loose wrapper or cloak which formed the outer dress of mourners. As regards the bodies of those crucified or impaled, the Law required that they should be taken down and buried that same evening (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). Here they remained exposed for six months, as a grim trophy of Gibeonite vengeance. <span class="cmt_word">Until water dropped upon them out of heaven;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">was poured upon them</span>; until copious and heavy rains came. The outpouring of these rains would put an end to the famine, and be regarded as a proof that the wrath of Heaven was appeased. There is no reason for supposing that these rains came before the usual period, in autumn, which was about the middle of October. Thus, for six months, with no other protection than her mantle of sackcloth hung against the rock, this noble woman watched the decaying bodies of her loved ones, until at last her devoted conduct touched David's heart, and their remains were honourably interred.

A new narrative begins here, and the heroic acts related in it are taken probably from some record of the martial deeds of David and his mighties. We have already seen that the Book of Jasher (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>) was a national anthology, full of ballads and songs in praise of glorious exploits of Israel's worthies. The source of the narratives recorded here apparently was a history in prose, and commenced, perhaps, with David's own achievement in slaying Goliath - a deed which celled forth the heroism of the nation, and was emulated by other brave men. These extracts were probably given for their own sake, and are repeated in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4-8</a>, where they are placed immediately after the capture of Rabbah; but they here form an appropriate introduction to the psalm of thanksgiving in ch. 22. It was usual in Hebrew, in making quotations, to leave them without any attempt at adapting them to their new place; and thus the "moreover" and "yet again," which referred to some previous narrative in the history, are left unchanged. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-16.htm">2 Samuel 21:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Ishbibenob, which <i>was</i> of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear <i>weighed</i> three hundred <i>shekels</i> of brass in weight, he being girded with a new <i>sword</i>, thought to have slain David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ishbi-benob.</span> The Hebrew has <span class="accented">Ishbo-benob</span>, which Gesenius interprets as meaning "dweller upon the height."

The Septuagint reads a "mace" instead of "new;" others think that he had a new suit of armour. If the narrator had thought it of sufficient importance to let us know that the article was new, he would scarcely have left the thing itself unspecified. It is evident, however, that the Septuagint did not read <span class="accented">hadasha</span>, "new," but the name of some strange warlike instrument, which being unknown to the scribes, they substituted for it a word which they did know, but which makes no sense. We cannot, however, depend upon the translation of the Septuagint, "mace." The want of special knowledge on the part of the translators of the Septuagint, though partly accounted for by the long absence from Palestine of its authors, and their having to depend entirely upon such knowledge of their language as survived at Alexandria, is more than we should have expected or can quite understand. Here, however, there is nothing remarkable in their not knowing the exact meaning of this carious weapon of the Rephaite; but plainly it could not be a mace, but must have been something that could be gift upon him. The Authorized Version, moreover, gives a look of probability to the insertion of "sword," which is wanting in the Hebrew; for it does not connect his purpose of killing David with the hadasha. The Hebrew is, "And Ishbo-benob, who was a Rephaite, and whose spear weighed three hundred shekels, and who was girt with an hadasha; and he thought to smite David."

He is called "the Hushathite," as being a descendant of Hushah, of the family of Judah, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Saph, which was of the sons of the giant;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">of the Raphah:</span> He is called <span class="accented">Sippai</span> in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a></div><div class="verse">And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew <i>the brother of</i> Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear <i>was</i> like a weaver's beam.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite.</span> The words "the brother of" are inserted by the Authorized Version in order to bring this place into verbal agreement with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, where we read that "Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite." The Jewish Targum had the same reading as that still found in the text, but regards Elhanan, "God is gracious," as another name for David, and, instead of Jair or Jaare, reads Jesse. Its translation is as follows: "And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Bethlehem, slew Goliath the Gittite." Possibly the Authorized Version is right in concluding that the present text is a corruption of that in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>. For, first, the repetition of <span class="accented">oregim</span>, "weavers," is suspicious, the Hebrew being, not "weaver's beam," but the plural "weavers' beam," <span class="accented">menor oregim.</span> Next, <span class="accented">Jaare</span> is a transposition of the letters of Jair (in the Hebrew) made probably in order that the compound <span class="accented">Jaare-oregim</span> may obey the rules of Hebrew grammar. More important is it to notice that <span class="accented">Lahmi</span> is part of the word "Bethlehemite" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-hallahmi</span>), and might thus easily suggest to the eye of a scribe the completion of so well known a word. We must add that among the thirty Gibborim is "Elhanan the son of <span class="accented">Dodo</span> of Bethlehem." Whoever slew Goliath's brother would certainly attain to high rank among the heroes, but if the name <span class="accented">Jair</span> is right, the Elhanan there spoken of is not the person who slew Lahmi.
