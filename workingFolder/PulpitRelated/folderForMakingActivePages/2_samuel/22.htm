The scribe who collected the Book of Psalms would be a priest, and he has repeated it with one or two additions, the most important of which is that the psalm was written "by David the servant of Jehovah." This title; meaning the minister or vicegerent of Jehovah, is one so high that it would certainly not have been given to David in his lifetime; nor was it even until Moses was dead that he was honoured with this rank (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>). But what was David's right to this title, which put him on a level with Moses? It was this: In adding to the sacrificial ritual enacted by Moses a daily service in the temple of sacred minstrelsy and songs, David was acting with higher powers than were ever exercised by any other person. For though, as we have seen, Samuel was the originator of these services in his schools, yet. there is a wide difference between private and public services; and David made his anthems part of the national liturgy. But it would only be when the halo of long use had gathered round his holy psalmody that David would be placed on in equality with Moses, and his authority a institute a new ritual for the nation be recognized. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Jehovah is my Cliff and my Stronghold and my Deliverer:<br />The God of my rock, in whom I take refuge;<br />My Shield and the Horn of my salvation,<br />My Fastness and my Place of refuge:<br />My Saviour: thou savest me from violence.<br />I call upon Jehovah, the praised One,<br />And I am saved from my enemies."</span> The Syriac in ver. 2 inserts, "Fervently do I love thee, Jehovah my Strength;" but it probably only borrows the words from <a href="../../par/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>. For we may well believe that it was at a later period of his life, after deeper and more heart searching trials, that David thus felt his love to Jehovah only strengthened and made more necessary to him by the loss of his earthly happiness. In ver. 3, <span class="cmt_word">The God of my rock</span> is changed in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> into "My God my Rock" (Authorized Version, "strength") - probably an intentional alteration, as being far less rugged and startling than this bold metaphor of the Deity being his rock's God. In the original the words present each its distinct idea. Thus in ver. 2 the <span class="accented">rock</span> is a high cliff or precipice. It is the word <span class="accented">sela</span>, which gave its name to the crag city of Idumea. <span class="cmt_word">Fortress</span> really means a rock, difficult of access, and forming a secure retreat. It is entirely a natural formation, and not a building. In ver. 3 <span class="accented">rock</span> is a vast mountainous mass (<a href="../../par/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a>), and, as it suggests the ideas of grandeur and immovable might, it is often used for God's glory as being the Strength and Protection of his people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>, margin). Next follow two ordinary metaphors, the <span class="accented">shield</span> for defence, and the horn for attack; after which David, who had so often sought safety among the cliffs and fastnesses of the mountains, returns to the same circle of thoughts, and calls God his <span class="cmt_word">High Tower,</span> the word signifying, not a building, but a height, a lofty natural stronghold; and finally <span class="accented">his Refuge</span>, a place of safe retreat among the mountains. This and the rest of the verse are omitted in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. In ver. 4 the words are as literally translated above, and signify, "Whenever call, I am saved." In all times of difficulty, prayer brings immediate deliverance.

But "cords of death" mean the fatal snares of the hunter, and are not in keeping with "torrents of wickedness." "Belial," literally, "worthlessness," is by many supposed, from the context to mean herd "destruction," that is, physical instead of moral wickedness. So in <a href="../../par/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a> "a counsellor of Belial" means a ruinous, destructive counsellor. <span class="cmt_word">Sheol</span> is the world of the departed, and is equivalent to "death." <span class="cmt_word">Cried</span> is the same verb twice used. In <a href="../../par/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a> it is altered, in the former part of the verse unto "I called" - a change probably suggested by the more fastidious taste of a later age. For temple we should translate <span class="accented">palace</span>, or <span class="accented">heavenly temple.</span> It is not the temple in Jerusalem, which was not yet built, but God's heavenly dwelling, that is meant. Instead of the terse ellipse, "And my cry in his ears," the full but heavy phrase, "My cry before him came into his ears," is substituted in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-6.htm">2 Samuel 22:6</a></div><div class="verse">The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</div><div class="comm">

But the poetic vigour of David's imagination intensities the imagery, and makes it more grand and startling. Not merely is there the earthquake and the volcano and the storm cloud, but the dim form of the Almighty is present, with the smoke of just anger at unrighteousness ascending from his nostrils, and the lightnings flashing forth to execute his wrath. But David certainly intended that these metaphors should remain ideal; and it was quite unnecessary for the Targum carefully to eliminate all such expressions as seem to give the Almighty bureau shape. In so doing it merely changes poetry into prose. But even more dull and commonplace is the explanation given by some modern commentators, that all that is meant is that David was once saved by a thunderstorm from some danger or other. Really this glorious imagery, taken from all that is grandest on earth, is intended to magnify to us the spiritual conception of God's justice coming forth to visit the earth and do right and equity. In ver. 8 for "the foundations of the heavens," we find in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a> "the foundations of the hills." The former is the grander metaphor, and signifies the mighty mountain ranges, like those of Lebanon, on which the skies seem to rest. <span class="cmt_word">The smoke</span> signifies hailstorms and, perhaps, also the rain driven in wreaths along the ground by the wind. <span class="cmt_word">Red hot cinders burned from him</span> describes the flashing lightnings that were shot forth like the coals from the refiner's furnace when heated to the full. It is to be regretted that the Revised Version retains the bathos of the old rendering, that God's fiery breath set coals on fire.

In this psalm the cherub is his chariot, on which he rides forth to judgment. <span class="cmt_word">He was seen.</span> There can be little doubt that the right reading is preserved in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, where we find a verb signifying the swooping down of a bird of prey upon its quarry (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>). The two words differ only in the substitution of <span class="accented">r</span> for <span class="accented">d</span>, and these letters are so similar in Hebrew that they are constantly interchanged. <span class="cmt_word">Booths</span>; made of branches of trees, and forming a temporary abode. So the dark storm clouds are gathered round the Almighty to veil his awful form from sight as he goes forth for judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Gathering of waters;</span> probably the right reading, instead of which in the psalm we find "dark waters." The gathering of waters would describe the massing of the rain clouds. The difference here also consists only in one letter. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the brightness,</span> which closely surrounds the Deity in the midst of the black mass of the tempest, the lightning flashes forth. This brightness is the Shechinah (see above), to which St. Paul also refers where he says that God's dwelling is in "the unapproachable light" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).

It is the same verb in all these places. <span class="cmt_word">Staff</span>; in the Authorized Version, "stay."

For while be acknowledges in them a tendency to sin, he affirms that he had been on his guard against it, and that he had ever kept God's statutes present before his view. However complete may be the penitent's recovery, yet can he never again be "perfect," the word applied to an animal without blemish, and therefore fit for sacrifice. The crime remains a blemish, even though the intense sorrow for the sin may make it the means of even attaining to a higher stage of spirituality and devotion. In ver. 22 the words literally are, "I have not sinned away from God," sin necessarily removing the sinner away from that nearness to God which is the privilege of the saint.

The general current of their lives is so ordered as to be in harmony with their characters. It is not by luck or good fortune that prosperity attends the righteous, nor is it by chance that things go awry with the fraudulent, but it is by the law of God's providence. <span class="cmt_word">Pious</span>. The Hebrew word means "pious" in the original sense of the word, which includes kindness to men as well as love to God. <span class="cmt_word">Perverse</span>. In the Authorized Version "unsavoury." Really it is the same word as that used in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>, and signifies "thou wilt make thyself twisted," only the form is archaic, as is the case with some other words here. Experience confirms the psalmist's verdict. For constantly a strange perversity of fortune and an untowardness of events are the lot of those whose hearts are crooked. <span class="cmt_word">Afflicted</span>. The word in the original includes the idea of humility, and so leads naturally on to the thought of the abasement of the proud. In the psalm the somewhat harsh expression used here has been softened into the more easy phrase, "The haughty eyes thou wilt bring down." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-27.htm">2 Samuel 22:27</a></div><div class="verse">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</div><div class="comm">

The lamp burning in the house is the proof of life and activity present there; and thus the extinguishing of the lamp means ruin and desolation (<a href="../../par/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a>). So David is called "the lamp of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>), because the active life of the nation centred in him. In a still higher sense the life and being of his people centres in God, and without him the soul is waste and void, like the universe before God said, "Let there be light." <span class="cmt_word">I run.</span> To the warrior in old time speed was as important as strength, and thus Homer constantly calls Achilles "fleet of foot." It was his fleetness which gave Asahel a high place among the mighties (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>), and to this quality David now refers. The <span class="cmt_word">troop</span> signifies a light armed band of marauders, whom with God's aid David could overtake, and stop in their course of rapine. The <span class="cmt_word">wall</span> means fortifications like those of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>).

In the second clause the word is <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, the ordinary name of God. The psalmist's question is a strong assertion that Jehovah alone is God, and that he alone is a Rock of safety for his people. <span class="cmt_word">He guideth,</span> etc. In <a href="../../par/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32</a> "He maketh my way perfect," like his own. The phrase here is probably that which David wrote, as being less usual, and it signifies that God will direct the upright man in his good way. <span class="cmt_word">Hinds</span>. David's feet are swift as hinds, an animal famous for its speed and sureness of foot. <span class="cmt_word">My high places.</span> The tops of the mountains are the favourite resort of the antelope (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>); and so with David, the possession of such rocky citadels as Bozez and Seneh (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4</a>) made him master of the whole country.

The bending of such a bow was proof of great strength, and the last artifice of Penelope, to save herself from the suitors, was to promise her hand to the man who could bend Ulysses' bow. <span class="cmt_word">Thy hearing of me;</span> in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>, and Authorized Version and Revised Version here, "thy gentleness." The words in the Hebrew are very nearly alike, but the Septuagint notices the difference, and translates "hearing" in this place, but "chastisement" in the psalm. The Vulgate has "gentleness" or "mildness" here, and "discipline" in the psalm. The Syriac alone has "discipline" in both places. <span class="cmt_word">My feet;</span> literally, <span class="accented">ankle bones</span>, the weakness of which causes men to totter.

This exultation of David at the result of his wars is in accordance with the harsh treatment inflicted by him upon the vanquished. His enemies were God's enemies, whom he must consume. The "new commandment" of Christianity forbids and condemns this delight in conquest. Vers. 41-43. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And mine enemies thou hast made to turn upon me their back,<br />Even those that hate me; and have utterly destroyed them.<br />They looked, but there was none to save,<br />Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.<br />And I beat them small as the dust of the earth;<br />As the mire of the streets I stamped upon them, I trode them down."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Those that hate me.</span> The sentence is to be completed from the previous clause, "my  haters" and "my enemies" being equivalent. There are several small variations between the text here and in <a href="../../par/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, such as "they cried" for they looked; and "I emptied them out" for I stamped upon them, the difference in both cases consisting in a single letter.

He now feels that the watchful which had protected him during that dangerous period had a higher purpose than the union of the twelve tribes under one head. He was to be the founder also of that empire over the nations which symbolized the gift of the heathen world to Christ. And this empire had been extended to people previously unknown to David. Such might be the case with Hadarezer, King of Zobah, but it more especially referred to Toi, and the Hittite kingdom of Hamath (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>). It was not from force of arms, but from the hearing of the ear, that is, from the wide extended fame of David's conquests, that Toi sent ambassadors to offer allegiance and presents. <span class="cmt_word">They fled trembling.</span> This is certainly the sense in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a>, where, however, there is a transposition of letters. Probably it is the sense here. But if we might go to the cognate languages for an explanation of a rare word, it would mean "came limping out of their fastnesses," as men worn out with fatigue and exhaustion.

Perhaps there seemed to the compiler to be some confusion in calling Jehovah, first David's Rock, and then the God of his rock (but see note on ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">Avengements</span>, in the plural. In the Law the sanctions were chiefly temporal, and therefore the saints of old watched anxiously for, and were strengthened by observing, the constantly recurring proofs of God's righteous government of men. <span class="cmt_word">Peoples</span>, in the plural; heathen nations. <span class="cmt_word">The violent man</span> may especially be Saul, as is supposed in the title prefixed to this song in the Book of Psalms. There probably it is general, and includes all who were bitter in their hostility to David.
