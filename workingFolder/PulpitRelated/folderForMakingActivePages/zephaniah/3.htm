Dr. Briggs renders, "From beyond the rivers of Gush will be my incense (<span class="accented">athar</span>); the daughter of Phut will bring a minchah." This brings out the parallelism. The universal worship of Messianic times is expressed in the ceremonial terms of the old dispensation, but has a very real applicableness to the Christian religion (see note on Malachi 1:11).
