EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE AND TO PERSEVERANCE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 1. <span class="accented">The prophet urges all to examine their ways before the day of the Lord come</span>; <span class="accented">and he prays the righteous to seek the Lord more earnestly, in order that they may be safe in the judgment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gather yourselves together</span>. So the versions; and this rendering is probably correct. The prophet calls upon his nation to assemble themselves together in order to take mutual counsel or to make general confession and supplication to God. Another rendering, based on some alteration of letters, is, "Set yourselves to be ashamed; yea, be ashamed" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-8.htm">Isaiah 46:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, gather together.</span> The LXX. renders the two words, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "be ye gathered and bound together;" "Id est," says Jerome, "estote vobis caritatis vinculo copulati." <span class="cmt_word">O nation not desired;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">gens non amabilis</span> - a litotes for abominable, hated for its sins, unworthy of God's love and care. The Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "unchastened," points to the meaning affixed by the Chaldee paraphrase, that does not wish to be converted," having no desire for amendment; like what is said in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>, "they received no correction." Others render, "which does not turn pale," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which is not ashamed, comparing <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>. The verb <span class="accented">kasaph</span> seems to have this meaning in niphal, according to Talmudic use; but its usual signification is "to pine" or "long for." The Revised Version gives in the margin, "that hath no longing" - a rendering adopted by Professor Gandell, implying that the people are quite satisfied with their present condition, and have no aspiration for anything better or higher (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>). This is a very apposite interpretation; but there is no sufficient ground for rejecting the translation of the Authorized Version, which is supported by high authority, is agreeable to the use of the word, and affords a satisfactory sense.

"The day" must be still the day of the Lord, not the day of life or the day of repentance. God brings on the judgment as easily and as quickly as the wind carries the chaff before it. The Septuagint and Syriac join the two clauses together; thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Before ye become as a flower that passeth away." And Jerome gives, "Priusquam pariat jussio quasi pulverem transeuntem diem," "Before the decree beget the day which passeth by like the dust." The present Hebrew text does not confirm these versions. The figure of the chaff is common (see <a href="../../par/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>).

Four of the five cities of the Philistines are mentioned, as denoting the whole territory, which again is the representative of the heathen world more definitely particularized later on. Thus the four quarters of the world are virtually specified: the Philistines representing the west,, the Moabites and Ammonites (vers. 8-10) the east, the Cushites (vers. 11, 12) the south, and the Assyrians (vers. 13-15) the north. <span class="cmt_word">Gaza</span> (see note on Amos 1:6) <span class="cmt_word">shall be forsaken;</span> depopulated and desolate. There is a paronomasia in the Hebrew: <span class="accented">Azzah will be azubhah.</span> Some of the other localities are treated in the same manner (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10-15</a>, and notes there). <span class="cmt_word">Ashkelon a desolation</span> (see note on Amos 1:8). <span class="cmt_word">They shall drive out Ashdod.</span> The inhabitants shall be expelled. (For Ashdod, see note on Amos, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) At the noon day. The hottest part of the day, the most unlikely time for a hostile attack, hence the expression is equivalent to "unexpectedly and suddenly" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>). Ekron shall be rooted up. In the Hebrew paronomasia, <span class="accented">Ekron</span> ("the Deep-rooted") shall be <span class="accented">teaker</span>. (For Ekron, see note on Amos, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>., where the fulfilment of prophecy concerning that town is noted.) Gaza (see note on Amos 1:7), after being depopulated and again re-peopled by Alexander the Great, fell into the hands of Ptolemy, and was destroyed by Antiochus,  <span class="date">B.C. 198</span> (Polybius, 'Reliq.,' 16:40; Pusey, p. 457). Often rebuilt, it was as often razed to the ground; and the present representative of the ancient town, Ghuzzeh, stands upon a hill composed of the accumulated ruins of successive cities. Of the condition of Ashkelon, Dr. Thomson writes, "There are no buildings of the ancient city now standing, but broken columns are mixed up with the soil .... Let us climb to the top of these tall fragments at the southeast angle of the wall, and we shell have the whole scene of desolation before us, stretching terrace after terrace, quite down to the sea on the northwest .... No site in this country has so deeply impressed my mind with sadness. They have stretched out upon Ashkelon the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness. Thorns have come up in her palaces, and brambles in the fortresses thereof, and it is a habitation of dragons and a court for owls (<a href="../../par/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11-13</a>)" ('The Land and the Book,' p. 546). "It was for ages," says Dr. Porter, "a great and strong city. Under the Philistines, the Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Saracens, the Crusaders, it was a place of note. The shattered walls that still surround the site were built by Richard Coeur de Lion. When I first clambered to the top of a broken bastion, a scene of desolation burst suddenly upon my view for which I was not prepared, though I had seen Baal-bec and Palmyra, Heliopolis and Memphis. The whole site was before me, and not a fragment of a house standing. One small section was covered with little gardens; but over the rest of the site lay smooth rounded hillocks of drifting sand. The sand is fast advancing - so fast, that probably ere the close of the century the site of Ascalon will have been blotted out forever" ('Illust. of Bible Proph.,' p. 21). As for Ekron, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Akir</span>, travellers note that it is now a little village, consisting of about fifty mud houses, without a remnant of antiquity except two large walls; its very ruins have vanished. The omission of Gath, a town at this time of small importance (see note on Amos 1:6), is probably owing to a feeling of the symbolism of numbers, four denoting completion, or the whole, like "the four winds, the four ends of the earth," etc.

To the east of this the hills commence, not the hill country, but a series of low spurs and undulating ground, culminating in hogs' backs, running nearly north and south, and rising in places to twelve hundred feet above the ocean" ('Survey Memoirs: Jerusalem,' p. 436). <span class="cmt_word">The nation of the Cherethites.</span> So in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>.

Part of David's bodyguard was composed of the same people (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). The name seems to have belonged to a portion of the Philistines who inhabited the southern part of the district. "One of the principal villages of Philistia is now called <span class="accented">Keretiya</span>, so that the term may apply to the inhabitants of this town - an ancient Cherith not mentioned in the Bible" (Courier's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 237).

Neale, "The road from Gaza to Askalon lay along the sea shore. In the winter months many parts of it are impracticable, owing to the encroachment of the sea. The surf then dashes wildly into the huge caverns worked out of the endless sand hills that line this coast. These caverns were tenanted, when we passed, by goatherds and their flocks. Thither they resort for shelter from the fierce heat of the noontide sun; and here during the night the goats are penned. There are wells and reservoirs in the vicinity which furnish water for the flocks the whole year round, and the brambles and thorn bushes that flourish near the seaside form their pasturage" ('Eight Years in Syria,' 1:40, 41).

The destruction of the kingdom of Israel and the weakness of that of Judah gave occasion to these neighbours to display their haughtiness and independence. The LXX. has, "my borders."

"There are no settled inhabitants," says Dr. Porter, writing of Moab, "but the hillsides and glens are studded with the ruins of ancient towns and villages. We at length pitched our tents by the lonely fountain of Heshbon. The site of this royal city is commanding - a rounded hilt on the edge of avast plateau, which extends on the south and east to the horizon, and on the west breaks down in steep slopes, jagged cliffs, and wild ravines, to the Dead Sea and Jordan valley, nearly four thousand feet below. The hill was the nucleus of the city. Its sides are covered  with ruins, and remains of houses, temples, and other buildings are strewn over a considerable section of the adjoining plain. All is desolate. Not a building, and scarcely a fragment of a wall, is standing; yet, though deserted for centuries, it bears its ancient name. I looked from Heshbon far and wide over the ancient territory of the Moabites, and saw desolation everywhere. The old towns and villages are all deserted and in ruins. In fact, there is not at this moment a single inhabited town or village in Moab, except Kerak, which stands on the extreme southern border. The sites of many were visible - grey mounds dotting the plain" ('Illust. of Bible Proph.,' pp. 24, 25). "The cities, towns, villages, are all in ruins. ... And no attempt is ever made to rebuild or repair; no man ventures to seek even a temporary abode among the ruined cities of Moab. The local Arab avoids the old sites, and seeks rest and security amid rocks and ravines; the powerful desert tribes sweep over the country periodically, and devour and destroy all in their track" (ibid., p. 28). <span class="cmt_word">Even the breeding of nettles;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a possession of nettles</span>; a place where nettles only grow.

Assyria was greatly indebted for its remarkable fertility to a very successful system of artificial irrigation, and when this was not maintained, great tracts soon relapsed into a wilderness (Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:68). "Cultivation," says Professor Rawlinson, "is now the exception instead of the rule. 'Instead of the luxuriant fields, the groves and gardens of former times, nothing now meets the eye but an arid waste' (Chesny). Large tracts are covered by unwholesome marshes, producing nothing but enormous reeds; others lie waste and bare, parched up by the fierce heat of the sun, and utterly destitute of water; in some places sand drifts accumulate, and threaten to make the whole region a mere portion of the desert" ('Anc.

The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ericius.</span> But neither hedgehog nor porcupine utters cries or frequents pools of water, and it may well be doubted whether some marsh-loving bird is not meant. Certainly the following clause suits the habits of a bird better than those of a hedgehog (see 'Bible Educator,' 3:312, where Dr. Tristram is quoted saying, "As a matter of fact, the bittern is very abundant in these swamps of the Tigris, and in all the marshy grounds of Syria; and its strange booming note, disturbing the stillness of the night, gives an idea of desolation which nothing but the wail of the hyena can equal"). No notice of the bittern seems to be found in the Assyrian monuments, though the mention of the heron is not uncommon. The <span class="accented">kaath</span> and <span class="accented">kippod</span> are commonly mentioned together, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>.

Others translate, "Hark! it singeth in the windows." There are no traces of windows in any of the Assyrian palaces, even in the case of chambers next the outer walls. If daylight were admitted, it must have entered through openings in the ceilings (Layard, 'Nineveh.' 2:260). Desolation shall be in the thresholds. The word rendered "desolation" (<span class="accented">chorebh</span>) Jerome notes may be read as meaning "sword," "drought." and "raven;" he adopts the last signification, and translates, in agreement with the LXX., <span class="accented">corvus.</span> But it seems best to take the term as signifying "desolation;" no human creature shall be found there, only ruin and rubbish. Ewald renders, "Owls shall sing in the windows, crows on the threshold, 'shivered. crushed.'" For he shall uncover (<span class="accented">he hath laid bare</span>) the cedar work. God, or the enemy, has so destroyed the palaces that the cedar panelling is exposed to the weather. Jerome has, "Attenuabo robur ejus." We see by Sennacherib's boast (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>) that the Assyrians imported cedars for building purposes. And we have monumental evidence of the employment of cedar in palaces at least since  the time of Assurnazirpal,  <span class="date">B.C. 860</span>. Esar-haddon reports that he received cypress and cedar from Lebanon as tribute; and Assurbanipal states that in erecting his palace he used cedar pillars from Sirjon and Lebanon (Schrader, 'Die Keilinschrift. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 183, 453). Neriglissar, King of Babylon,  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>, in rebuilding his palace, records that he "arranged tall cedars for its roof" ('Records of the Past,' 5:142).
