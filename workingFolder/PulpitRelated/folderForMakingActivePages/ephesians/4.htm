Inference not only from last chapter, but the whole Epistle. Paul's interest in the Ephesians led him to a double application of the great subject which he had expounded: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to ask God on their behalf that he would bestow on them the full measure of the blessing to which of his grace they were entitled (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to entreat them on God's behalf to live in a way befitting their high calling (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>.).

An exhortation from such a prisoner ought to fall with double weight. <span class="cmt_word">Beseech you to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye were called.</span> Their call was to be God's people (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a>); this not a mere speculative distinction, but one that must have practical form and that must lead to suitable fruit. True grace in the heart must show itself by true goodness in the life. They were not to conceal their religion, not to be ashamed of it, but to avow it and glory in it, and their lives were not to be disgraced by unworthy conduct, but to be brightened and elevated by their relation to Christ.

Long-suffering and loving forbearance are phases of the same state of mind - denoting the absence of that irascibility and proneness to take offence which flares up at every provocation or fancied neglect, and strives to maintain self-control on every occasion. It is from such qualities in God that our redemption has come; it is miserable to <span class="accented">accept</span> the redemption and not try to attain and exhibit its true spirit.

"endeavoring," and denotes an object to be carefully and earnestly watched for and promoted. "The unity of the Spirit" is equivalent to the unity of which the Spirit is the Author. In all in whom he works savingly, the Spirit produces a certain oneness in faith, in repentance, in knowledge, in their views of sin, grace, Christ, the world, etc. This oneness exists, and cannot but exist, even when Christians are not careful of it, but the <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of it is lost; it seems to the world as if there were no such oneness. "Many men, many minds," says the world, when believers differ much and contend much, and are at no pains to preserve and manifest the unity wrought by the Spirit. It is due to the Spirit, as well as to the interests of the kingdom of God, that the unity of the Spirit be maintained <span class="cmt_word">in the bond of peace.</span> The genitive, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, is commonly held to be that of apposition, the bond which consists of peace - a peace-loving spirit, a spirit laying more stress on the points in which Christians agree than those in which they differ.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There is</i> one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - WHEREIN UNITY CONSISTS - SEVEN PARTICULARS. There is one body (see <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>). The Church is an organic whole, of which believers are the members, and Christ the Head, supplying the vitalizing power: The real body, being constituted by vital union with Christ, is not synonymous with any single outward society. <span class="cmt_word">One Spirit</span>; viz. the Holy Spirit, who alone applies the redemption of Christ, and works in the members of the Church the graces of the new creation. <span class="cmt_word">As ye also were called in one hope of your calling.</span> This is one of the re-suits of the Spirit's work; when the Spirit called you he inspired you all with one hope, and this one hope was involved in the very essence of your calling (comp. <a href="../../par/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, "Looking for the blessed hope, even the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ"). To all believers the Spirit imparted this one blessed hope. <span class="cmt_word">One Lord</span>; Jesus Christ, unique and beyond comparison: as Teacher, all hang on his words; as Master, all own his supreme authority; to his example all refer as the standard; his likeness all covet as the highest excellence (where Mary is worshipped, though nominally you have but one Lord, virtually you have two). <span class="cmt_word">One faith</span>; not objective in the sense of creed, but as denoting the one instrument of receiving salvation (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>), the one belief in the one Savior by which we are justified, adopted, and in other ways blessed. <span class="cmt_word">One baptism</span>. One initiatory rite admitting into the visible Church - baptism in name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, symbolic of the washing of regeneration, the one way of entering the Church invisible. <span class="cmt_word">One God and Father of all.</span> We rise now to the fountain of Godhead, the one supreme Being with whom all have to do, the only Being who is or can be the Father of us all; who can be to us what is implied in the name "Father," who, so love and grace can satisfy our hearts. <span class="cmt_word">Who is over all</span>; the supreme and only Potentate, exercising undivided jurisdiction, "doing according to his will in the armies of heaven." etc. <span class="cmt_word">And through all</span>; pervading the whole universe, sustaining and ruling it, not dwelling apart from his works, but pervading them; not, however, in any pantheistical sense, but as a personal God, whose essence is separate from his works. <span class="cmt_word">And in all.</span> A closer and more abiding influence; he dwells in them, and walks in them, molding their inner being, and filling them with his own light and love. Some commentators of mark have tried to find a reference to each of the persons of the Godhead in the three prepositions <span class="accented">over</span>, <span class="accented">through</span>, and <span class="accented">by</span>, but this seems a strained view. The three persons, however, appear clearly in the seven elements of unity, but, as before (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>), in the reverse of the common order - first, the Spirit; second, the Son; and third, the Father. These seven elements constitute the true rarity of the Church. It is out of the question to identify the Church which is thus one, with any external organization like the Roman Catholic Church. How many millions have been connected with it who have notoriously been destitute of the one hope, the one Spirit, the one Father! It is of the invisible Church the apostle speaks, and his exhortation is, seeing that this blessed sevenfold unity is the unity wrought by the Holy Spirit, maintain that unity; maintain the manifestation of it; give no occasion to any one to say that there is no such unity - that the Holy Ghost is a Spirit of confusion and not a Spirit of order and unity.

Compare parable of talents. "Grace" does not refer merely to supernatural gifts, but also to the ordinary spiritual gifts of men. These are varied, because what each gets he gets for the good of the rest; the Church is a fellowship or brotherhood, where each has an interest in all and all in each, and is bound to act accordingly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high he led captivity captive, and received gifts for men.</span> The speaker is God, the author of Scripture, and the place is the sixty-eighth psalm. That psalm is a psalm of triumph, where the placing of the ark on Zion is celebrated as if it had been a great victory. As this quotation shows, the psalm in its deepest sense is Messianic, celebrating the victory of Christ. The substance rather than the words of the passage are given, for the second person ("thou hast ascended," etc.) is changed into the third; and whereas in the psalm it is said, "gave gifts <span class="accented">to</span> men," as modified by the apostle it is said, "received gifts for men." As in a literal triumph, the chiefs of the enemy's army are led captive, so the powers of darkness were led captive by Christ (captivity, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, denotes <span class="accented">prisoners</span>); and as on occasion of a triumph the spoils of the enemy are made over to the conqueror, who again gives them away among the soldiers and people, so gifts were given to Christ after his triumph to be given by him to his Church. We must not force the analogy too far: the point is simply this - as a conqueror at a triumph gets gifts to distribute, so Christ, on his resurrection and ascension, got the Holy Spirit to bestow on his Church (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now (the fact) that he ascended, what does it imply but that he descended first?</span> The ascent implied a previous descent; that is, the ascent of the Son of God - of one <span class="accented">who was himself in heaven</span>, who was in the bosom of the Father (comp. <a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>), implied that he had come down from heaven, a striking proof of his interest in and love for the children of men. And the descent was net merely to the ordinary condition of humanity, but to a more than ordinarily degraded condition, not merely to the surface of the earth, but <span class="cmt_word">to the lower parts of the earth.</span> This has sometimes been interpreted of Hades, but surely without reason. If the expression denotes more than Christ's humble condition, it probably means the <span class="accented">grave</span>. This was the climax of Christ's humiliation; to be removed out of men's sight, as too offensive for them to look on - to be hidden away in the depths of the earth, in the grave, was indeed supremely humbling. The object is to show that, in bestowing gifts on men, Christ did not merely bring into play his inherent bountifulness as the Son of God, but acted as Mediator, by right of special purchase, through his work of humiliation on earth; and thus to lead us to think the more highly both of the Giver and of his gifts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens.</span> There was a proportion between the descent and the ascent. His descent was deep - into the lower parts of earth; but his ascent was more glorious than his descent had been humbling. The Hebrew idea of various heavens is brought in; the ascent was not merely to the third heaven, but far above all heavens. <span class="cmt_word">That he might fill all things.</span> A very sublime view of the purpose for which Christ reigns on high. The specific idea with which the apostle started - to give gifts to men - is swallowed up for the moment by a view far grander and more comprehensive, "<span class="accented">to</span> fill all things." Jesus has gone on high to pour his glory and excellence over every creature in the universe who is the subject of grace, to be the Light of the world, the one Source of all good. As in the solar system it is from one sun that all the supplies of light and heat come, all the colors that beautify earth, <span class="accented">sea</span>, and sky, all the influences that ripen the grain and mature the fruit, all the chemical power that transforms and new-creates; so the ascended Jesus is the Sun of the universe; all healing, all life, all blessing are from him. It is quite in the manner of the apostle, when he introduces the mention of Christ, to be carried, in the contemplation of his person, far above the immediate occasion, and extol the infinite perfection and glory that distinguish him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gave some (to be) apostles.</span> Coming back to the diversity of gifts (ver. 7), He enumerates some of these, as Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">he</span>, emphatic) bestowed them. The organization of the Church is not a mere human arrangement; its officers are of Divine appointment. The first gift is, his apostles. It is not meant that he gave to some the gifts needed to constitute them apostles, though that is true; but that, having qualified some to be apostles, he gave them to the Church. An apostle had his commission direct from Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>); he possessed supernatural gifts (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>); it was necessary for him to have seen the Lord (<a href="../../par/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>); his diocese was the whole world (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>). The apostles were the constituent body of the Church - they had all necessary gifts for setting it up, and as all Christian history has testified, they were a marvelous gift of Christ to his Church. <span class="cmt_word">And some, prophets.</span> Next to the apostles in point of value, as gifts to the Church, having supernatural knowledge of God's will present and future (<a href="../../par/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>). Prophets were indispensable before the New Testament was given as the Church's infallible guide to the will of God, but not apparently necessary after the will of God was fully recorded. <span class="cmt_word">And some, evangelists.</span> The nature of this office is known only from the meaning of the term and the work of those who bore the designation (<a href="../../par/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>) - persons not attached to a particular congregation, but who went about preaching the glad tidings, and otherwise building up the Church, but without the full powers of apostles. <span class="cmt_word">And some, pastors and teachers.</span> The more ordinary settled ministers of congregations, called pastors, because they watched over the flock, trying to lead all in right ways; and teachers, because they communicated Divine knowledge. Some have thought that each expression denotes a separate office, but, coupled as they are together, it is better to regard them as indicating two functions of one office (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>).

Some maintain that it implies that <span class="accented">all</span> these offices are to continue in the Church until the result specified is obtained (Catholic Apostolic or Irvingite Church): this is contradicted by Scripture and by experience, so far as apostles and prophets are concerned, for the gifts for these offices were not continued, and without the gifts the offices are impossible. The meaning is that, till the event specified, there is to be a provision in the Church of the offices that are needed, and the apostle, in using "until," probably had in view the last office in his list - pastors and teachers. <span class="cmt_word">To the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</span> Both genitives are governed by unity; already there is one faith (ver. 5), but we all, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. all who compose or are yet to compose the body of Christ, the totality of this body, have to be brought to this faith. As in ver. 5 "faith" is not equivalent to "creed," or truth believed, but the act of believing; so here the consummation which the ministers of the Church are given to bring about is a state in which faith in the Son of God shall characterize all, and that, not a blind faith, but a faith associated with knowledge. Usually faith and knowledge are opposed to each other; but here faith has more the meaning of trust than of mere belief - trust based on knowledge, trust in the Son of God based on knowledge of his Person, his work, and his relation to them that receive him. To bring all the elect to this faith is the object of the ministry; when they are all brought to it, the body of Christ will be complete, and the functions of the Christian ministry will cease. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</span> The idea of organic completeness is more fully expressed by these two clauses; the consummation is the completeness of the whole body of Christ as <span class="accented">such</span>; but that involves the maturity of each individual who is a constituent part of that body; and the measure or sign of maturity, both for the individual and for the whole, is the stature of the fullness of Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "<span class="accented">Whom</span> he did foreknow, them he also foredained to be <span class="accented">conformed to the image of his Son"</span>). The question has been put - Will this consummation be in this life or the next? The one seems to melt into the other; the idea of a complete Church and that of a new economy seem inseparable; as the coming of Christ will terminate the observance of the Lord's Supper, so it will terminate the ministries ordained by Christ for the completion of his Church.

The ignorant and inexperienced lie at the mercy of abler persons, and, when there is no regular ministry provided by Christ, are liable to be swept along by any plausible person that professes to be a Christian teacher, and such persons are often very dangerous, working <span class="cmt_word">by the sleight of men,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cunning legerdemain by which the teachings of men - teachings devised by the hearts of men - are made to appear to the uninitiated the same as Christ's teaching. <span class="cmt_word">In craftiness, tending to the scheme of error.</span> Such teachers employ crafty methods, apparently harmless, but tending to further the method or scheme of error. The strong language here used corresponds with that in which, at Miletus, the apostle warned the elders of Ephesus of the "grievous wolves" that were to come in among them, and of the men "speaking perverse things" that were to arise among themselves, not sparing the flock (<a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>).

How great the work of growth is that should be sought in the case of every living believer is evident from the enormous gulf there is between his spiritual and moral state and that of Christ. Yet such growth is reasonable, considering the relation of the body to him, its Head. The fact of this relation should encourage us to seek and expect the growth, and encourage ministers to labor hopefully towards promoting it.

Not, however, in a mere <span class="accented">individual</span> sense, but as an organization, the parts being adapted and articulated to one another (this process being continuous; see present participles, (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). In the Church there are babes in Christ, also young men and old men; some are clear in intellect, some strong in faith, some warm in love, some excel in passive virtues, some in active; but in a well-ordered Church these should be getting jointed together, and learning to work with and for one another, no one despising gifts which he has not but another has; in tiffs sense, there ought to be a spiritual communism, for all are one spiritual body. But spiritual communism does not involve social communism or even social equality, nor will social distinctions be obliterated in a pure Church, except so far as they hinder spiritual communion. <span class="cmt_word">According to the energy in the measure</span> (or, <span class="accented">proportion</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of each individual part.</span> This clause seems to be most naturally connected with what follows. In the fit framing of the body, channels as it were are laid for the propagation and working of the vital force throughout the body; this force is not alike, but of various amount in the different parts; some members have much of it, some little, but the measure of this vital three regulates the growth. <span class="cmt_word">Carries on the growth of the body.</span> The middle voice, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, indicates that it is a growth from within, while depending on the energy furnished by Christ. <span class="cmt_word">For building up of itself in love.</span> This is the end, <span class="accented">so far as the body itself is concerned</span>, though, of course, the completed spiritual body, like the completed natural body, has work to do outside itself. In a healthy Church there is a continual work of building up: construction, not destruction, is its proper business - promoting peace, purity, prayerfulness, trust, activity in the work of the Lord, but all in love, the absence of which makes winter instead of summer, declension instead of progress, death instead of life. In illustration of the various measure of grace, and yet its real efficiency in all the members of the Church, Eadie says, "No member or ordinance is superfluous. The widow's mite was commended by him who sat over against the treasury. Solomon built a temple. Joseph provided a tomb. Mary the mother gave birth to the child, and the other Marys wrapped the corpse in spices. Lydia entertained the apostle, and Phoebe carried an Epistle of old, the princes and heroes went to the field, and wise-hearted women did spin. While Joshua fought, Moses prayed. The snuffers and trays were as necessary as the magnificent lampstand.... The result is that the Church is built up, for love is the element of spiritual progress. That love fills the renewed nature." The Church has been defined as an institution that has truth for its nourishment, love for its atmosphere, and Christ for its Head.

Truth apart from the person of Christ has little power; abstract doctrines have little influence; the very atonement may be a barren dogma. But the atonement taught "in Jesus," in connection with the living, loving, dying, risen Savior tells; the blood of redemption in connection with the Son of God incarnate thus loving us, and meekly, patiently suffering the agonies of the cross in our room, is not only a power, but the greatest moral power that can move the heart.

The change is very decided and very complete. It is emphatically <span class="accented">personal</span>; not a mere change of opinions or of religious observances, but of life, habit, character; not altering a few things, but first putting off <span class="accented">the man</span> as we put off a garment. "It is a change which brings the mind under the government of truth, and gives to the life a new aspect of integrity and devoutness." Which is rotting according to the lusts of deceit.

Sin is a disintegrating dissolving thing, causing putridity, and in all cases, when unchecked, tending towards it. Deceit is personified; it is an agent of evil, sending out lusts which seem harmless but are really ruinous - their real character is concealed; they come as ministers of pleasure, they end as destructive tyrants. Lust of power, lust of money, lust of pleasure, have all this character; they are the offspring of deceit, and always to be shunned.

This renewal is the work of the Holy Spirit; how, then, can it be the subject of an exhortation to us? In this sense, that we are to prize, long for, encourage, watch, this work of the Holy Spirit, feeling it to be most vital and essential, not to be neglected without awful sin and danger. Usually the Holy Spirit works in us by stirring up our spirit to desire and endeavor after holiness; to resist these strivings of the Spirit, or even to be indifferent to them, is a deadly and most dangerous sin.

A new object is clean, fresh, tidy; let your life have something of the same aspect - let your principles, aims, habits, be new, in the sense of being conformed to Christ, who is your life. <span class="cmt_word">Which after God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.</span> "After God," equivalent to "after the image of him that created him" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>). Some think" the new man" equivalent to "Christ" (<a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>), constituted the Head of renewed humanity, as Adam of depraved. But this would not correspond with the exhortation to put off the old man, nor should we be exhorted to put on Christ <span class="accented">after</span> being exhorted to be renewed in the spirit of our minds. In what sense, then, has the "new man" been created? The idea presented itself to the apostle <span class="accented">in the abstract - there</span> has been a creation of a new man; but concretely, we have to conform to the Divine creation, in respect of righteousness and holiness; righteousness denoting personal uprightness and fidelity to all social duties; holiness, the state of the spirit toward God. The last words, "of truth," denote the relation of righteousness and holiness to the truth. The words are opposed to "of deceit" in ver. 22. Lust is bred of deceit, but righteousness and holiness of truth. They never deceive, never disappoint, are solid to the end.

It is an attribute of fallen humanity: "They go astray from the womb, speaking lies;" and one of the earliest vices that appear in children is deceit. Not only is it God's will and command that we speak the truth, but it is peculiarly incumbent on Christians as children of the light, as followers of him who is the Truth, as having renounced the devil, who is the father of lies. Another reason is added. <span class="cmt_word">For ye are members one of another.</span> Falsehood is always designed to mislead; but to deceive our own members is emphatically wicked. Says Chrysostom (quoted by Eddie), "Let not the eye lie to the foot, nor the foot to the eye. If there be a deep pit, and its mouth, covered with reeds, shall present to the eye the appearance of solid ground, will not the eye use the foot to ascertain whether it is hollow underneath or whether it is firm and resists? Will the foot tell a lie, and not the truth as it is? And what, again, if the eye were to spy a serpent or a wild beast, will it lie to the foot?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a></div><div class="verse">Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye angry, and sin not.</span> Quotation from the Septuagint version of <a href="../../par/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a>. Anger, the feeling and expression of displeasure, is not wholly forbidden, but is guarded by two checks. Our Lord did not make anger a breach of the sixth commandment, but being angry with a brother <span class="accented">without cause</span>. The first check is to beware of sinning; to keep your anger clear of bitterness, spite, malevolence, and all such evil feelings. The second is, <span class="cmt_word">Let not the sun go down on your irritation</span>; examine yourself in the evening, and see that you are tranquil. Eadie quotes Thomas Fuller: "St. Paul saith, 'Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,' to carry news to the antipodes in another world of thy revengeful nature. Yet let us take the apostle's meaning rather than his words - with all possible speed to depose our passion; not understanding him so literally that we may take leave to be angry till sunset; then might our wrath lengthen with the days, and men in Greenland, where day lasts above a quarter of a year, have plentiful scope of revenge. And as the English, by command of William the Conqueror, always raked up their fire, and put out their candles when the curfew bell was rung, let us then also quench all sparks of anger and heat of passion." It is especially becoming in men, when about to sleep the sleep of death, to see that they are in peace and charity with all men; it were seemly always to fall asleep in the same temper.

There seems no special reference to the last exhortation, but as that demands a special act of vigilance and self-control, so the activity of the devil demands vigilance and self-control on all occasions, and especially on those on which the devil is most apt to try to get a foothold. The reference to the devil is not a figure, but an obvious recognition of his personality, and of the liability of all Christians to fall under his influence.

In either case it implies that even Christians might continue to steal, and that they had to be warned against the habit. This may seem strange to us, but not to those who consider how little theft was thought of among the pagans, and how liable such habits are to remain among converts from heathenism. Where there is a low moral tone and an uneducated conscience, very great irregularities may be found. Dishonesty in trade, deceit in business, are just the same. Among the Ephesians, thieving was probably the result of idle habits and of dislike to hard work. Hence the apostle says, But rather let him labor, working with his hands the things that are good, that he may have to impart to him that hath need. Idleness is mean, labor is honorable; Christ calls us to work, not for this reason only, but in order that we may have something to give away. Paganism would rob others of what is rightfully their own; Christianity leads me to give to others what is rightfully my own. This different genius of the two systems appears here very clearly. Observe the true use of superfluities - look out for the needy, and give for their relief.

The aorist, "<span class="accented">forgave</span>," is more literal and better than the perfect, "hath forgiven;" it points to a definite time when forgiveness was bestowed, viz. the moment of real belief in Christ, and hearty acceptance of his grace. The vague atmosphere in which many envelop the question of their forgiveness is very hurtful; it checks their thanksgivings, dulls their joy, quenches hope, and dilutes the great dynamic power of the gospel - the power that impels us to forgive our brother, as well as to abound in the work of the Lord with a tender conscience, the sense of forgiveness urges to the most full and hearty doing of God's will; but when hypocrites, with seared consciences claim to be forgiven, they steal what is not their own, and become more abandoned to wickedness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ephesians/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ephesians 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ephesians 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ephesians/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ephesians 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ephesians 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
