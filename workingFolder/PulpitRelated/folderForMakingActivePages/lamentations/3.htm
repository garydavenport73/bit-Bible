An analogous expression m <a href="../../par/job/30-13.htm">Job 30:13</a> is rendered in the Authorized Version, "they mar my path." Thenius thinks that the destruction of a raised causeway is the figure intended; but the word is quite correctly rendered "paths;" see the note of Delitzsch on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschIsaiah 59:8.

But the Massora mention <a href="../../par/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, as passages in which "my people" is used, whereas we should expect "peoples." The Syriac Version of our passage actually translates "to all peoples," and the prefixed "all" certainly favours the plural, and so, in a far higher degree, does the view we have been led to adopt of the speaker of this Lamentation (see Introduction). The correction (<span class="accented">ammim</span> for <span class="accented">ammi</span>) has been received by Archbishop Seeker, by Ewald, and by J.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he hath (unnatural as it may seem in Israel's Father) given me stones instead of bread (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-9.htm">Matthew 7:9</a>). The Jewish rabbi commonly called Rashi thinks that a historical fact is preserved in these words, and that the Jewish exiles were really obliged to eat bread mixed with grit, because they had to bake in pits dug in the ground. So too many later commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Grotius, who compares a passage of Seneca ('De Benefie.,' 2:7), "Beneficium superbe datum simile est pani lapidoso." <span class="cmt_word">He hath covered me with ashes;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he hath pressed me down into ashes.</span> A figurative expression for great humiliation. So in the Talmud the Jewish nation is described as "pressed down into ashes" ('Bereshith Rabba,' 75). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/3-17.htm">Lamentations 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast removed my soul</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast rejected my soul.</span> The words look like a quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a> (Hebrew, 15), where they are undoubtedly an address to Jehovah. But there is another rendering, which grammatically is equally tenable, and which avoids the strangely abrupt address to God, viz. <span class="accented">My soul is rejected</span> (<span class="accented">from peace</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/3-18.htm">Lamentations 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-21.</span> - These verses prepare the way for a brief interval of calmness and resignation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remembering</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remember.</span> It is the language of prayer.

In the next verse we read, "This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope," which seems inconsistent with ver. 20 as given in the Authorized Version. An equally grammatical and still more obvious translation is, <span class="accented">Thou</span> (<span class="accented">O God!</span>) <span class="accented">wilt surely remember, for my soul is bowed down within me.</span> The latter part of the line is a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>, at least, if the text be correct, for the closing words do not cohere well with the opening ones. The Peshito (Syriac) has, "Remember, and revive [literally, 'cause to return'] my soul within me," which involves a slightly different reading of one word. But more tempting than any other view of the meaning is that of Bickell, though it involves a correction and an insertion, "My soul remembereth well and meditateth on thy faithfulness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This I recall to my mind,</span> etc.; viz. that thou wilt remember me, or, thy faithfulness (ver. 20). Here again there appears to be a reminiscence of a passage in <a href="../../par/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42</a>. (ver. 4). Others suppose that "this" refers to the following verses; but in this case a new section would begin in the middle of a triad (the triad of verses beginning with <span class="accented">zayin</span>), which is certainly improbable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is of</i> the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-36.</span> - RESIGNATION AND HOPEFULNESS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - It is of <span class="cmt_word">the Lord's mercies</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">The Lord's mercies that we are not consumed.</span> But the "we" is difficult, especially considering that in ver. 23 (which is clearly parallel) the subject of the sentence is, not "we," but "the Lord's mercies." Hence it is probable that the reading of the Targum and the Peshite (adopted by Thenius, Ewald, and Bickell) is correct, "The Lord's mercies, verily they cease not" (<span class="accented">tammu</span> for <span class="accented">tamnu</span>).

The thought of the verse is that of <a href="../../par/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>.

Youth is mentioned as the time when it is easier to adapt one's self to circumstances, and when discipline is most readily accepted. The words do not prove that the writer is young, any more than vers. 9 and  100 of <a href="../../par/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>. prove that the psalmist was an aged man (against this view, see vers. 84-87). There is no occasion, therefore, for the textual alteration (for as such I cannot help regarding it), "from his youth," found in some Hebrew manuscripts in Theodotion, in the Aldine edition of the Septuagint, and in the Vulgate. The reading was probably dictated by the unconscious endeavour to prop up the theory of Jeremiah's authorship. The scribes and translators remembered, inopportunely, that the trials of Jeremiah began in early manhood.
