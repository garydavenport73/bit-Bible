The word occurs only once outside this Epistle (<a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), and it was, perhaps, from Christ's use of it then that St. John adopted it (verses 12, 28; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>).

As distinct from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13, 18</a>), the word seems to imply spiritual fatherhood. <span class="cmt_word">These things</span> (the section, <a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-10</a>) <span class="cmt_word">I write to you, that ye may not sin.</span> The aorist forbids the rendering, "continue in sin;" as before, those who are walking in light and yet sin through frailty are addressed. Two apparently contradictory principles have been set forth: you must walk in light; you must confess that you sin. St. John now goes on to reconcile them. I write <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to charge you not to sin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> [to tell you that] if we sin, we have an Advocate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of understanding "to tell you that," we may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> as "and yet" - a frequent use in St. John. There are two seemingly opposite truths - sin is wholly alien from the Christian, and the Christian is never wholly free from sin; and St. John struggles to give them their right balance, not in the dialectical manner of St. Paul, but by stating them alternately, side by side, varying the point of view. <span class="cmt_word">We have an Advocate.</span> The possession of the Advocate is as continual <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as of the sin (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>). Every one feels that "a <span class="accented">Comforter</span> with the Father" is an impossible rendering. But St. John alone uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, four times in his Gospel of the Spirit (see on John 14:16), and once here of Christ. Is it likely that he would use so unusual and important a word <span class="accented">in two different senses</span>, and that in two writings intended as <span class="accented">companions to one another?</span> The rendering "Advocate," necessary here, carries with it the rendering "Advocate" in the Gospel. Moreover, what is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, if Christ is an <span class="accented">Advocate</span>, but the Spirit a <span class="accented">Comforter?</span> If Christ is one Advocate and the Spirit "another Advocate," all is intelligible. Philo frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the high priest as intercessor for the people, and also of the Divine <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. There is a difference, however, between "Paraclete" as used of the Spirit and as used of Christ. It is applied to the Spirit in his relation to the disciples; to Christ in his relation to the Father. Christ is our Advocate <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>: his advocacy <span class="accented">turns towards</span> the Father to propitiate him. And not in vain; for he is himself "righteous." A sinner could not reconcile God to sinners; but a righteous Advocate can, for his character is a warrant for the righteousness of his cause. Thus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the set-off to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>. One who has sinned needs an advocate; one who has not sinned can best undertake the office. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> at the end, without the article, is gently suggestive of the plea, "Jesus Christ, <span class="accented">a Righteous One."</span>

Although <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> does not necessarily include the idea of sacrifice, yet the use of the word in the LXX, and of <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Hebrews 2:27) and <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>) in the New Testament, points to the expiation wrought by the great High Priest by the sacrifice of himself. It is <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, because the prominent fact is Christ as an Offering rather than as One who offers. With the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>. Our sins are the <span class="accented">subject-matter</span> of his propitiatory work. <span class="cmt_word">And not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</span> Again we seem to have an echo of the prayer of the great High Priest (<a href="../../par/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20, 24</a>). The propitiation is for all, not for the first band of believers only. The sins of the whole world are expiated; and if the expiation does not effect the salvation of the sinner, it is because he rejects it, loving the darkness rather than the light (<a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>). No man - Christian, Jew, or Gentile  - is outside the mercy of God, unless he places himself there deliberately. "It seems clear that the sacrifice of Christ, though peculiarly and completely available only for those who were called, does in some particulars benefit the whole world, and release it from the evil in which the whole creation was travailing" (Jelf). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-6.</span> - Thirdly, walking in the light involves obedience. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And herein we perceive that we know him, if we keep his commandments</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, we come to know, we recognize; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, we have come to know, we know). The token of our having this knowledge is stated hypothetically; not <span class="accented">because</span>, but if, we obey. To serve under another and obey him is one of the best ways of knowing his character. The knowledge is  no mere intellectual apprehension, such as the Gnostic, postulated, but a moral and spiritual affection and activity. It is possible to know and hate (<a href="../../par/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>). Again, the knowledge is not a mere emotional appreciation. Christianity knows nothing of piety without morality. To know Christ is to love him, and to love him is to obey and imitate him. By "keep" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is recant "keep the eye fixed upon, <span class="accented">observe."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The participial substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> now takes the place of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> with the subjunctive, but the two are equivalent (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>, which is almost exactly parallel to this, and shows what "knowing him" really is, viz. having fellowship with him, just as not keeping his commandments is the same as walking in darkness). St. John says, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, not, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the case being hypothetical - if there be such a man, he is a liar, and has no idea of truth (see on 1 John 1:8). He must have lost the very power of recognizing truth to maintain that he knows Christ, when he habitually transgresses his commands. It is no great thing, as Bode says, to know as the devils do, who "believe and tremble." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Once more (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7, 9</a>) the opposite is stated and the thought carried further. <span class="cmt_word">But whoso keepeth his word</span> (his doctrine as a whole, including the separate commandments), <span class="cmt_word">of a truth in him hath the love of God been perfected;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as an accomplished fact; the relation of love has been established. In St. John <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is no mere expletive; it expresses reality, and reality that is <span class="accented">known.</span> From verse 4 we might have expected "of a truth <span class="accented">he knoweth God</span>;" but the apostle goes beyond this, and shows that really knowing God involves loving him (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). The context shows that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is objective - his love of God rather than God's love of him. The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> here, and the drift of the Epistle thus far, are in favour of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in verses 3-5 meaning God rather than Christ, although <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in verse 2 tells the other way. The last clause sums up and reaffirms, but as usual with a new turn of thought, the whole section (verses 3-5), which begins and ends with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Knowing God implies keeping his Word; and keeping his Word involves loving him; and all this implies being in him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, having that fellowship with him and his Son in which the Christian's life (which is eternal life) consists, and to promote which St. John publishes his Gospel (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3, 4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Profession involves an obligation to act up to the profession.

To be or abide in God or in Christ implies an <span class="accented">habitual condition</span>, not isolated apprehensions of his presence. Obedience, not feeling, is the test of union; and the Christian who is really such has least to tell of "experiences" of special visitations. He who is ever in the light has few sensible illuminations to record. Note the strong <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">even as</span> (not merely <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>, as); nothing less than "the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>) is to be aimed at.

"New wine must be put into <span class="accented">fresh</span> skins" (<a href="../../par/mark/2-22.htm">Mark 2:22</a>). Are two commandments meant - one to cultivate brotherly love, the other to walk as Christ walked? Or is there only one, which from different points of view may be regarded as either new or old? Commentators are divided; but the latter seems better. Then what is the commandment which is at once new and old? The whole gospel, or the command to love one another? <a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> and John 15:2 will incline us to the latter view. The command was old, for" Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) was part of the Mosaic Law. But the <span class="accented">standard</span> was new: "Even as I loved you;" "Even as he also walked;" and the <span class="accented">motive</span> was new: because "God so loved us" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). Brotherly love, enforced by such an example, and based on such a fact, was a new command as compared with the cold injunction of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning</span> may have either of two senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from of old, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, long  before the Gospel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the beginning of your career as Christians.

How can "the darkness is passing away," etc., be a commandment? <span class="cmt_word">The light, the true light</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the real, the perfect, the <span class="accented">very</span> light, that which most fully realizes the ideal of light; in opposition to those "wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever" (<a href="../../par/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>).

These verses set forth in a variety of forms the affinity between love and light, hatred and darkness, and the consequent incompatibility between hatred and light. "Hate" <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not to be watered down into "neglect" or "fail to love." St. John knows nothing of such compromises. Love is love, and hate is hate, and between the two there is no neutral ground, any more than between life and death, or between Christ and antichrist. "He that is not with me is against me." "Love is the moral counterpart of intellectual light. It is a modern fashion to represent these two tempers as necessarily opposed. But St. John is at once earnestly dogmatic and earnestly philanthropic; for the Incarnation has taught him both the preciousness of man and the preciousness of truth" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith.</span> For the fifth time St. John points out a glaring inconsistency which is possible between profession and fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6, 8, 10</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a>.9); cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>. In all these passages the case is put hypothetically; but in some of the Gnostic teaching of the age this inconsistency existed beyond a doubt. Is in darkness even until now. His supposing that hatred is compatible with light proves the darkness in which he is. Nay, more, it shows that, in spite of his having nominally entered the company of the children of light, he has really never left the darkness. "If ye loved only your brethren, ye would not yet be perfect; but if ye hate your brethren, what are ye? where are ye?" (St. Augustine). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-10.htm">1 John 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Whereas he who loves his brother has not only entered the region or' light, but has <span class="accented">made it his home:</span> he abideth in the light. It is difficult to determine whether the "occasion of stumbling" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is in reference to himself or to others. The context here and <a href="../../par/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9, 10</a> are in favour of the former. It is a man's own salvation that is under consideration here, not his influence over others: and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> seems exactly parallel. To have no light in one is to be in danger of stumbling; to have light in one is to have no occasion of stumbling (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>, which is very parallel). But elsewhere in the New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means a stumbling-block or snare in <span class="accented">another's</span> way, not in one's <span class="accented">own</span> way; and this makes sense here. There is yet a third explanation. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> may mean "in it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "in the <span class="accented">light</span> there is no occasion of stumbling." This makes a good antithesis to the close of verse 11, "knoweth not whither he goeth." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-11.htm">1 John 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Note the alternation: verse 10 is the antithesis of verse 9, and verse 11 of verse 10, repeating and enlarging verse 9. Note also the climax effected by the gradual increase of predicates: in verse 9 one, in verse 10 two, in verse 11 three. The brother-hater has darkness as his habitual condition and as the atmosphere in which he lives and works; and long ago (aorist) the continual darkness deprived him of the very power of sight, so that he is in ignorance as to the course he is taking. Cf. "They know not, neither will they understand; <span class="accented">they walk on in darkness"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>); "The fool <span class="accented">walketh in darkness"</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a>). "St. John scouts all the pretences of men to illumination which do not involve the practical acknowledgment of brotherhood. A man may say he is in the light as much as he pleases; but to be in the light implies that he is able to see his brethren, and not to stumble against them" (Maurice).

This suggests several questions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">What is the difference between</span> "I <span class="accented">write"</span> (<span class="accented">or</span>, "am writing") and "I <span class="accented">wrote"</span> (or, "have <span class="accented">written</span>;" for this is a case where the English perfect may represent the Greek  aorist)? Five answers are given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The change is made for <span class="accented">emphasis:</span> "I write; I wrote; there is nothing more to be said." But in this case the past tense should come first: "I wrote; I write it again." Moreover, we should expect the perfect rather than the aorist, as in <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "I write" refers to what <span class="accented">follows</span>; "I wrote," to <span class="accented">what precedes.</span> And some have even tried to find out the three different portions in each part of the Epistle; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "I <span class="accented">write to</span> you, little children" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15-17</a>); "to you, fathers" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18-27</a>); "to you, young men" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28-3:22</a>): "I <span class="accented">wrote</span> to you, children" (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-7</a>); "to you, fathers" (chapter 1:8-2:2); "to you, young men" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-11</a>). But this is fanciful and very arbitrary; and in this case also the past tense should come first: "I have written thus far to you; again I proceed to write to you." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "I write" refers to the <span class="accented">whole Epistle</span>; "I wrote," to what <span class="accented">precedes.</span> This answer has the sanction of the 'Speaker's Commentary;' but it seems to be quite frivolous. What could induce St. John first of all to tell each class that he writes the <span class="accented">whole</span> Epistle to them, and then to tell them that he wrote the <span class="accented">first part of it</span> to them? There would be little enough sense in first saying that he wrote the beginning to them, and then that he writes the whole to them; but there is no sense in the former statement if it comes after the latter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> "I am writing" is <span class="accented">from St. John's point of view</span>, as he pens the growing letter. "I wrote" is from <span class="accented">the readers' point of view</span>, as they peruse the completed letter. But what is gained by this change of standpoint? Is it probable that St. John would make three distinct addresses in the position of the writer of the Epistle, and then solemnly repeat them in the position of the recipients of it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The Epistle is written as a companion to the Gospel: therefore "I write" refers <span class="accented">to the Epistle</span>, which he is in the act of composing; "I wrote," to <span class="accented">the Gospel</span>, which lies completed before him, and on which the Epistle serves as a commentary. This seems to be the most satisfactory explanation (see on chapter 1 John 1:4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Who are indicated by the three classes?</span> In the first triplet, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as elsewhere in the Epistle (verses 1, 28; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4, 5, 21</a>), refers to his readers as a whole, of whom <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> are two component divisions. This is probably the case in the second triplet also, although the change from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> renders this a little doubtful (see on verse 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Does the difference between "fathers" and</span> "young <span class="accented">men" refer to age as men or age as Christians?</span> Probably the former. In both Gospel and Epistle St. John writes to mature and well-instructed Christians. The following table will illustrate the view taken: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">I write this Epistle</span>: ? <span class="accented">Reasons for writing it</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To all of you. ?

No less fit, but for a different reason, are the younger among his readers. To fight is the lot of the young soldier; and a victorious warfare against Satan is the distinction of youthful Christians.

Some would limit <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to actual children; but in that case we should expect a different order - children, young men, fathers; or fathers, young men, children.

He is forbidding those things the love of which rivals and excludes the love of God - all those immoral tendencies and pursuits which give the world its evil character. The world <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is order; the things in the world are the elements of disorder - those things which arise from each man making himself the center of the world, or of some little world of his own creation. These rival centers clash with one another, and also with the one true Center. All this St. John forbids.

Not the former, for its object is already passing away; while not only does the Father abide for ever, but he who loves him and does his will abides for ever also. The antithesis, as usual, is a progress; it carries us beyond the limits of the original statement. The world is passing away like a dissolving view. It has its sentence of death in itself; its decay has begun. And even if it were not passing away, our capacity for enjoying it would none the less certainly come to an end. "The sensualist does not know what the delights of sense are; he is out of temper when he is denied them; he is out of temper when he possesses them" (Maurice). To love the world is to lose everything, including the thing loved. To love God is to gain him and his kingdom. Some men would have it that the external world is the one thing that is certain and permanent, while religion is based on a mere hypothesis, and is ever changing its form. St. John assures us that the very reverse is the case. The world is waning: it is God alone and his faithful servants who abide. As St. Augustine says, "What can the world promise? Let it promise what you will, it makes the promise, perhaps, to one who tomorrow will die." <span class="cmt_word">The will of God</span> is the exact antithesis of "all that is in the world." The one is the good power "that makes for righteousness;" the other is the sum of the evil powers which make for sin. Abideth for ever is literally, <span class="accented">abideth unto the age</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>).

The contrast is not between "passing away" and "lasting <span class="accented">forever,"</span> but between "passing away" and <span class="accented">abiding</span> till "the age" comes. But as "the age" is the age of eternity as distinguished from this age of time, the rendering "abideth for ever" is justified.

It is the last hour. What does this mean? There is scarcely room for doubt. The perishableness of the world has suggested the thought of its end, and St. John goes on to warn his readers that this thought is full of meaning to them; for they may recognize the time in which they are living as the last hour by the many antichrists that have arisen. "The last hour" can only mean <span class="accented">the last hour before the second coming of Christ.</span> Nothing but the unwillingness of Christians to admit that an apostle, and especially the Apostle St. John, could seem to be much in error about the nearness of the day of judgment, could have raised a question about language so plain. All explanations about its signifying the Christian dispensation, or the nearness of St. John's death, or the nearness of the destruction of Jerusalem, must be firmly set aside. How could the rising of antichrists show that the Christian dispensation had begun? It was Christ, not antichrist, that showed that? What had antichrists to do with St. John's death? or with the fall of Jerusalem, which, moreover, had fallen many years before this Epistle was written? Just as the apostles, even after the Resurrection (<a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>), remained grossly ignorant of the <span class="accented">nature</span> of Christ's kingdom on earth, so to the last they remained ignorant of its <span class="accented">duration.</span> The primitive Church had not yet found its true perspective, and, in common with all Christians of the first age, the apostles believed that Christ would return soon, possibly within the lifetime of some then living. "Yea, I come quickly" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>) was by them understood in the most literal sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;</span>. But it will not surprise those who remember Christ's very strong declaration (<a href="../../par/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>), to find even an apostle in ignorance as to the time of the second advent of Christ. But it may very reasonably and reverently be asked, What becomes of the inspiration of Scripture if an inspired writer tells the Church that the end of the world is near, when it is not near? The question of inspiration must follow that of interpretation, not lead it. Let us patiently examine the facts, and then try to frame a theory of inspiration that will cover them; not first frame our theory, and then force the facts to agree with it. But the question in its proper place requires an answer. The Old Testament prophets were often guided to utter language the Divine meaning of which they did not themselves understand. They uttered the words in one sense, and the words were true in a far higher sense, of which they scarcely dreamed. The same thing is true of the New Testament prophets,  though in a less degree, because the gift of Pentecost had given them powers of insight which their predecessors had not possessed. The present text seems to be an illustration of this truth. We can hardly doubt that, in saying, "it is the last hour," St. John means to imply that within a few years, or possibly even less time, Christ will return to judgment. In this sense the statement is not true. But it may also mean that the last period in the world's history has begun; and in this sense we have good reason for believing that the statement is true. "That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" is not rhetoric, but sober fact. By the Divine standard times are measured, not according to their duration, but their importance; it is their meaning, not their extent, which gives them value. What are all the measureless prehistoric aeons of the material universe compared with the time since the creation of rational life? What are the thousands of years covered by the Old Testament compared with the portion of a century covered by the New? The great crisis in the history of the world, constituted by the life and death of Christ, will never be equaled until he comes again. When he ascended to heaven the last hour sounded. There may follow a silence (as it seemed to St. John) about the space of half an hour, but (as human experience may prove) of half a thousand centuries. Yet the duration of the period, as measured by man, will not alter its essential characteristics; it was, is, and will still remain, "the last hour." <span class="cmt_word">Even as ye heard</span> (when ye were instructed in the faith) <span class="cmt_word">that antichrist cometh</span> (is destined to come). Antichrist in this also is assimilated to the Christ; he is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This was the teaching of the gospel (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 23-26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22, 23</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). What does St. John mean by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>? The four passages (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>) in which he uses the term do not enable us to answer the question with certainty. The predominant idea is that of <span class="accented">opposition</span> to Christ, and <span class="accented">rivalry</span> of Christ, rather than merely of <span class="accented">counterfeiting</span> Christ. If <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> were formed on the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean "vice-Christ, vicar of Christ." It is, however, analogous to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the Greek for a counterfeit Christ is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). But we are left in doubt whether this rival of Christ is a principle or a person. None of the four passages is decisive. Here we are not sure whether the arising of many antichrists proves that the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of antichrist is already in the world, or that by them the way is fully prepared for the one <span class="accented">personal</span> antichrist. Either the existence of the antichristian character, or the approach of the antichrist, is given as evidence that the day of the Lord is at hand. The latter is the more probable. A great personal opponent to the personal Christ seems to be indicated both by St. John and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-8</a>). The Jews expected a personal opponent of the Messiah to precede the Messiah - Armillus, Gog, Antiochus Epiphanes, and the like (Ezekiel 38:39; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>); and Christians from the earliest times have expected a similar prelude to the return of the Messiah. The term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is absolutely peculiar to St. John in the New Testament.

Besides these there are practical antichrists. "Let us mark, not the tongue but the deeds. For if all be asked, all with one mouth confess that Jesus is the Christ. Let the tongue keep silent awhile: ask the life. If the Scripture itself shall tell us that denial is a thing done not only with the tongue, but also with deeds, then assuredly we find many antichrists if deeds are to be questioned, not only do we find many antichrists gone out, but many not yet manifest, who have not gone out at all" (St. Augustine).

There is evidence of a fourth variation, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> "ye know all" the antichrists. If <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> be right, it does not mean that the Christian is omniscient, but that he has the basis of all knowledge; he can see things in their right proportions. The <span class="accented">apostle's</span> own disciple, St. Polycarp, writes to the Philippians 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-21.htm">1 John 2:21</a></div><div class="verse">I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The first <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> belongs to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not to <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>: I wrote to you, not because ye know not, etc. It does not mean "I omitted to write to you because ye know not." Whatever meaning we give to the aorists in verses 13, 14 need not be retained here. There is here no abrupt change from present to aorist. Moreover, verse 26 limits this <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> to the present section. What in verse 20 is spoken of as "all things" (assuming <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> to be right) is here spoken of as "the truth." St. John writes to well-instructed Christians, to adults in the faith. It is precisely because they "know the truth" that he addresses them, especially to warn them against antichrists. We are in doubt whether <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, depends upon <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> ("and because")or upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("and that"). The former is better; it introduces a second reason for his writing. Some take <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, in all three places as "that" after <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>: "I did not write to you and say that ye know not the truth, but that ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth." Every lie is fundamentally and <span class="accented">ab origine</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> separate from the truth; and hence his readers will easily recognize lies and liars, for they know the truth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22</a></div><div class="verse">Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?

From the lie St. John passes on to the utterer of it. "Ye readily distinguish any lie from the truth. Who, then, is the liar?" "The liar" does not mean the liar <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, as if this denial constituted the very acme of falsehood. To deny the very existence of God is surely a worse lie. Still less can we say that "the context leaves no doubt that 'the liar' is the same with 'the antichrist.'" The article <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, just as in <a href="../../par/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4, 5</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>. The very form of sentence is the same: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> and there <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> cannot mean the victor, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, who is Christ, and not the believer. So that the Authorized Version is not so very inaccurate in rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "a liar." "Who tells lies, if not he who denies (and says) that Jesus is not the Christ?" This was the great Gnostic lie to which St. John's Gospel and Epistle give the answer. The antichrist is this, he who denieth the Father and the Son. "The antichrist" here is not the great adversary, but one having similar characteristics. He denies the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus virtually denies both the Father and Son (comp. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>). This truth St. John proceeds to restate and develop. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-23.htm">1 John 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: <i>(but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one who denieth the Son</span> not only does that, but <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> doth not possess the Father. To deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Son of God, for the Christ is the incarnate Son; and to deny the Son of God is to deny the Father also, for the incarnate Son is the Revelation of the Father; and not only so, but to deny the Son is to cut one's self off from the Father, for "no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him." To emphasize this great truth St. John uses his favourite motive of stating it both negatively and positively. To deny the Son is not to have the Father; to confess the Son is to have the Father (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3, 6, 7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>). Note the solemn asyndeta. There is not a single connecting particle in verses 22-24; the sentences fall on the ear like minute-guns. "Every one that denieth." There is no exception. Even an apostle, if he denies that Jesus is the Christ. thereby also loses all possession of the Father. The history of philosophy verifies the statement. Deism has ever a tendency to end in pantheism or atheism.

"What St. John would have us feel is this, that there can be no promise to compare with this - that we should share the eternal life, the life of God....  We often speak as if people were to be paid for being good; not as if the being good were itself God's highest gift and blessing" (Maurice). The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (B) for <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is worthy of notice. In verses 16, 17 St. John gives two reasons for shunning the world: because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the world is alien to the Father; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is passing away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So here he gives two for holding fast the truth originally delivered to them: because the truth leads <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to fellowship with God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to eternal life.

"These things" refers to what precedes, especially verses 18-23, as distinct from what now follows. The present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the continual attempt of these false teachers to lead the "little children" astray. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>, as in verse 21, is the "epistolary aorist" (see on 2 John 1:4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a></div><div class="verse">But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - Parallel to verse 24, but stating as a fact what is there given as a command. The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> again marks the emphatic contrast between St. John's readers and the antichrists. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means "from Christ" (verse 20). The indicative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> states what <span class="accented">ought</span> to be true of them, and is a delicate equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (verse 24). The anointing of Christ <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> abides with them as a permanent gift, and renders further apostolic teaching unnecessary. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the superfluous teaching refers to the antichrists. The ideal to which the Christian must aspire is the being led into all truth by the Spirit; he will need no human teachers then (see the remarkable parallel to this in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, and the quotation of it in <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10, 11</a>). The construction in the middle of the verse is amphibolous. We may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> either as the apodosis of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you...  so it is true") or as a continuation of the protasis, which is resumed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you...  and is true...  and even as"). Thereafter is better. The emphatic "and is no lie" is thoroughly Johannine (see on verse 23). The conclusion of the verse is doubtful also. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is certainly preferable to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> may be indicative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in the first clause, or imperative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in the next verse. The latter is more probable.

The coming of Christ suggests the righteousness of Christ; for it is as the righteous Judge that he is coming, and those who would not be ashamed to meet him at his coming must be righteous also. Once more (verse 27) we are in doubt between indicative and imperative: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, in spite of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and following <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is probably indicative. To know that God (not Christ; comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>) is righteous is to perceive that every doer of his <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> righteousness is a son of God (not of Christ; we are nowhere in Scripture said to be born of Christ). To partake of that righteousness which is God's nature is proof of birth from him. With <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, compare <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>). Righteousness must be shown in <span class="accented">conduct</span>; mere desire to be righteous will not suffice. And the conduct must be <span class="accented">habitual</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; a single  act of righteousness will not suffice. Note the change from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. To know (intuitively) that God is righteous is to come to know (by experience) that whoever habitually acts righteously is God's offspring. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_john/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 John 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 John 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_john/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 John 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 John 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
