The passage seems clearly to teach that there are two rival influences contending for power over the spirits of men. We must test men's spirits to see whether they are organs of the Spirit of truth or of the spirit of error. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beloved</span> (as in <a href="../../par/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a> and 1 John 3:18, the apostle again breaks out with a personal appeal into an earnest exhortation suggested by the statement just made), <span class="cmt_word">prove the spirit</span>s <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. "The spirits" are principles and tendencies in religion: these need to be tested, for earnestness and fervour are no guarantee of truth. And to test these principles is the duty of the individual Christian as well as of the Church in its official capacity. Just as every Athenian was subjected to an examination <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as to his origin and character before he could hold office, so the spirit of every religious teacher must be examined before his teaching can be accepted. This is no useless precaution; because, as Christ has come forth <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> from God (<a href="../../par/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-42.htm">John 8:42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>), ninny false prophets have come forth <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> from the spirit of error. But perhaps "have gone forth into the world" means no more than " have displayed <span class="accented">themselves" in publicum prodierunt.</span> There is probably no reference to the false teachers having "gone forth from us" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>). Besides Cerinthus and other Gnostics, there were the Nicolaitanes, astrologers, professors of magic, and dealers in charms, some of which seem to have had their origin in Ephesus, for they were known as "Ephesian letters." Apollonius of Tyana was eagerly welcomed at Ephesus, and it is not impossible that his visit took place during St. John's lifetime.

As so often, St. John states the case both negatively and positively for emphasis. There is an ancient variant reading of much interest, probably of Latin origin, which can be traced back to the second century, being known to Tertullian and Iranaeus. For <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> it gives <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">solvit Jesum.</span> This corruption of the text was evidently aimed at those who distinguished the man Jesus from the Divine Christ, and thus "dissolved" his Personality. The Greek manuscripts are quite unanimous against the reading. Is not of God; and therefore is of the evil one (see on 1 John 3:10). These professedly Christian teachers are ever among the most dangerous who treat the Divinity of Jesus Christ as more or less of an open question, or as a matter of indifference. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> probably means "the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of antichrist," understanding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> from the preceding clause rather than (quite vaguely) "the characteristic of antichrist" (see on 1 John 2:18, to which passage, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> does not refer, (but to Christian teaching in general). And now it is in the world already. This is an independent statement; St. John does not say that they had heard this previously. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of God.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is in emphatic opposition to the false teachers (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>). They are on one side, and the apostle's readers on the other, and it is from this standpoint that they are to "prove the spirits." St. John knows nothing of any neutral position from which the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error can be criticized "with absolute impartiality." "He that is not with me is against me." This assumed neutral position is already within the domain of error. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have overcome them.</span> "Them" means the false teachers; but in what sense have St. John's "little children" overcome them? He may be speaking by anticipation; confident of the victory, he writes of it as an accomplished  fact (comp. <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). But it is better to take the statement literally. By refusing to listen to the false teachers (<a href="../../par/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8</a>) the sheep have conquered them: the seducers have "gone out" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>), unable to hold their own within the fold. Nor is this wonderful: the one side have God with them, the other Satan. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> here is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/12-31.htm">Luke 12:31</a>). Just as God is in believers and they in God, so the world is in the evil one (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>) and the evil one in it.

The "we" here is not the same as the "ye" there, with the mere addition of the writer. "We" here seems to mean the apostles. If it is considered "broad enough to include all who have truly received Christ by faith," it leaves no one to be the hearers. "He that knoweth God heareth us" will mean that we hear ourselves, if "us" means all believers. But St. John's meaning seems rather to be that he who <span class="accented">acquires knowledge</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of God is ready to listen to further apostolic instruction. <span class="cmt_word">From this</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> need not be confined to verse 6; it may apply to the whole passage.

From <a href="../../par/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11, 12</a> St. John renews his exhortations to love, this time at greater length and in closer connexion with the other great subject of this second half of the Epistle, the birth from God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beloved</span> (see on verse 1) The address is specially suitable where the subject is love. As before, we must not look for the chief purport of the section in the exhortation with which it opens. Just as "prove the spirits" is subordinate to "every spirit which confesseth," etc., so "let us love one another" is subordinate to "God is Love." (For the history and meaning of the specially Christian term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>, see Trench's 'Synonyms of New Testament.') 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - In giving the opposite, St. John again varies the thought, this time very remarkably. Instead of "love is of God" (verse 7), we have "God is Love" - a far deeper thought; and instead of "knoweth not God," we have "knew not God," or, as we should say in English, "hath not known" or "never knew God." The man's not loving his brother shows that in no real sense has he ever in the past known God: he is of the world (chapter 3:1), not of God. We must beware of watering down "God is Love" into "God is loving," or even "God of all beings is the most loving." Love is not a mere <span class="accented">attribute</span> of God; like light, it is his very <span class="accented">nature.</span> As "God is Light" sums up the Being of God intellectually considered, so "God is Love" sums up the same on the moral side. Only when this strong meaning is given to the statement does St. John's argument hold, that "he that loveth not knoweth not God." A man who has no idea of any one of the <span class="accented">attributes</span> of God, as order, or beauty, or power, or justice, has an <span class="accented">imperfect</span> knowledge of God. But he who has no idea of love has no knowledge of God, for love is himself. God alone loves in the fullest and highest sense of the word; for he alone loves with perfect disinterestedness. It is love which alone can explain creation. Why should a Being perfectly blessed in himself create other beings, but to bestow a blessing upon them? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The verse is very similar to chapter 1 John 3:16, "in this" referring to what follows, and introducing a concrete and crucial example of love. Beware of the inadequate and misleading rendering "towards us" for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It means <span class="cmt_word">in us</span>, and belongs to "manifested," as <a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a> plainly shows. We must not connect together "the love of God in us," still less "the love of God toward us," as one idea. "In us" means "in our case," and the whole may be paraphrased: "A transcendent manifestation of the love of God has been made in regard to us, in that he hath sent," etc. The verse might serve as a summary of St. John's Gospel. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> as applied to Christ is peculiar to St. John; it and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> are the key-words of the passage. "This is love indeed; it is his <span class="accented">only</span> Son whom he has sent, and he has sent him to give us life." Note the double article - "his Son, yes, his Only Begotten." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Let no man think that any higher manifestation of love than this can be found. It is not in any love of man to his Maker, but in his Maker's love to him, that the real nature of love can be perceived. Note the change from perfect to aorist; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in verse 9 expresses the permanent results of the mission; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> here states the mission as an accomplished fact complete in itself. (For <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, see on 1 John 2:2.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beloved</span> introduces a solemn exhortation, as in verses 1, 7. The "if" implies no uncertainty (see on 1 John 5:9); it puts the fact more gently, but not more doubtfully, than "since." The "so" <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>  covers both the quality and the quantity of the love. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> belongs solely to <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>: "we also on our part ought to love one another." We should have expected as the apodosis, "we also ought to love God." But this link in the thought the apostle omits as self-evident, and passes on to state what necessarily follows from it. In verse 12 he shows how loving God involves loving one's fellow-men (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a> for a similar passage over an intermediate link). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No one hath ever yet beheld God.</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> stands first for emphasis. and without the article, as meaning the Divine Being rather than the Father in particular: "With regard to God - no one hath ever yet beheld him" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, stronger than <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Why does St. John introduce this statement here? Not, of course, as implying that to love an invisible Being is impossible; but that the only security for genuine and lasting love in such a case is to love that which visibly represents him. Seeing that God is invisible, his abiding in us can be shown only by his essential characteristic being exhibited in us, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by our showing similar self-sacrificing love <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> can scarcely mean God's love for us; for how can our loving one another make his love perfect? Nor yet vaguely, "the relation of love between us and God;" but, as in <a href="../../par/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a>, our love for him. Our love towards God is perfected and brought to maturity by the exercise of love towards our brethren in him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-13.htm">1 John 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Almost identical with <a href="../../par/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>. In verses 1-7 the apostle says that confession of the Incarnation proves possession of the Spirit; and in verse 12 that love of the brethren proves the indwelling of God. He now (verse 13) goes on to say that possession of the Spirit proves the indwelling of God; and (verse 15) that confession of the Incarnation proves the same. So that these four facts - confession of the Incarnation, possession of the Spirit, love of our fellow-men, and indwelling of God - mutually involve one another. St. John does not say, "He has given us his Spirit," but "of his Spirit <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>." It is impossible for us to receive more than a portion; the fullness of the Spirit is possessed by Christ alone. In <a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a> we have a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Saviour of the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we have beheld, and do bear witness.</span> The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> clearly means "we apostles;" and "beheld" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> implies contemplation with bodily eyes, as in verse 12. The invisible God can be only "invisibly seen" by the pure heart. But the incarnate Son has been visibly contemplated; and to bear witness of this fact was the very office of an apostle (<a href="../../par/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The language of this verse, as of chapter 1 John 1:1, 3, would be strained and rather unreal in one who had not seen the Christ in the flesh. Note that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> has no article, and is not in mere apposition, but is a second predicate: "The Father <span class="accented">hath</span> sent [see on verse 10] the Son as Saviour," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to be such. "The world," as commonly in St. John's writings, is specially the unregenerate among the human race. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-15.htm">1 John 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever confesseth</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>. This rendering seems preferable to "whosoever <span class="accented">shall</span> confess" or "shall <span class="accented">have</span> confessed." The exact meaning is, "Whosoever has once for all taken up the position of confessing." Verse 14 gave the case of the apostles; this gives that of those who accept their witness. In the next verse we have that of both together. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we have come to know and believe.</span> Both perfects are virtually presents, expressing the present continuance of a condition begun in the past: "We know and continue to believe." Experience and faith are intimately connected; and sometimes the one precedes, sometimes the other (<a href="../../par/john/6-69.htm">John 6:69</a>). As in verse 9 <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> should be rendered in us, not "to us" or "toward us;" and here also the interpretation, "in our case," is certainly possible, and perhaps safer. But the meaning may be that the object of our knowledge and faith is that portion of his own love which God has <span class="accented">in us.</span> It is "in us," and is exercised towards him and our brethren, but in reality it is his - it is himself abiding <span class="accented">in us.</span> In either case love is the object of our faith. Thus love is not only the true note of the Church (<a href="../../par/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>), it is also the Church's creed. The second half of the verse restates the main proposition of this section with a view to further development. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This verse raises various questions which can scarcely be answered with certainty. Does "herein" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> look back to verse 16? or forwards to "that" <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>? or forwards to "because" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>? Again, does "with us" <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> belong to "is made perfect" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>? or to "love" <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>? <a href="../../par/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a> inclines us to refer "herein" to "that" <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>; and "with us" or "among us" goes better with the verb than with the subject: "Herein has love reached its perfection among us Christians, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in the Church, that we have confidence in the day of judgment." This is the perfection of love to have no fear. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, introduces the reason for this confidence: its basis is <span class="accented">our likeness to Christ.</span> especially in being united to the Father (<a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21, 23, 26</a>). Compare "even as <span class="accented">he</span> is pure" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>), and <span class="accented">"even as he</span> is righteous" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>): <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in all three cases. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Love implies attraction, fear  repulsion; therefore fear exists not in love. Love here means the <span class="accented">principle</span> of love in general; it must not be limited to God's love to us, or our love to God, or our love of the brethren. Love and fear coexist only where love is not yet perfect. Perfect love will absolutely exclude fear as surely as perfect union excludes all separation. It is self-interested love that fears; pure and unselfish love has no fear. Yet nothing but perfect love must be allowed to cast out fear. Otherwise this text might be made an excuse for taking the most unwarrantable liberties with Almighty God. To cease to fear without attaining to perfect love is to be irreverent and presumptuous. Hence the apostle is once more pointing out an ideal to which Christians must aspire, but to which no one attains in this life. There is a fear, as Bede points out, which prepares the way for love, and which comes only to depart again when its work is done. <span class="cmt_word">Because fear hath punishment.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> must not be rendered indefinitely "suffering" or "torment" (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>; Wisd. 11:14; 2 Macc. 4:38). But <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> does not mean "deserves" or "will receive punishment," but quite literally "has it." It is the day of judgment and fear in reference to that day that is under consideration; and fear of punishment is in itself punishment by anticipation. Note the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, introducing a contrary and then a contrast back again: "There is no fear in love; nay, perfect love casteth out fear: but he that habitually feareth [present participle] is not made perfect in love." The dread of punishment may deter men from sin; but it cannot lead them to righteousness. For that we need either the sense of duty or the feeling of love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a></div><div class="verse">We love him, because he first loved us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We love.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is spurious, and is not to be understood: the love is again quite general. "We have this principle of love." To take <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as subjunctive in the sense "let us love" is less forcible. St. John states as a fact what ought to be a fact. "We Christians do not fear, but love. Yet this is no credit to us. After God's love in giving his Son for us it would be monstrous not to love." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a></div><div class="verse">If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Ebrard and others make a new section begin here; but verses 21, 22 are in intimate connexion with what precedes. What is this love of which the apostle has been speaking? Is it the love of' God or of our fellow-men? Both; love of our brethren is organically bound up with love of God. To love God and hate one's brother is impossible. Sight, though not necessary to affection, aids it; and it is therefore easier to love men than God. If a man fails in the easier, will he succeed in the harder? Moreover, to hate one's brother is to hate God. "Whoso rejecteth you rejecteth me, and whoso rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me." Note the negative, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>. St. John has no definite person in view as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, but any one who may happen to be of such a character, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. As before, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are treated as equivalent; there is no neutral term between "love" and "hate." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-21.htm">1 John 4:21</a></div><div class="verse">And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he who loveth God love his brother also.</span> This is the great commandment, on which hang all the Law and the prophets (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>), and, whatever we may think of the relation between seeing and loving, there is the Divine command to love, not only the invisible God, but the visible brother in whom the invisible God dwells. Sight may hinder as well as help; it is hard to love what is squalid and hideous. In such cases let us remember the Divine command; let us remember the Divinity which even the most debased humanity contains. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_john/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 John 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 John 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_john/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 John 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 John 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
