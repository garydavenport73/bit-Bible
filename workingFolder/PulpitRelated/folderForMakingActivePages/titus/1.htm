It is nearly the same thing to say that the true faith, and the perfect knowledge of the truth, and the hope of eternal life promised by God, are the sphere in which the apostolic office moves and acts. "The faith of God's elect," etc., seems to imply that there was in some who were not elect (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19, 20</a>) a corruption of the faith, a departure from it - a faith that was no faith, and something calling itself <span class="accented">truth</span> which was not "according to godliness," and so to point to rising heresies. The authors of these heresies were chiefly Jews (ver. 10), of whom there was a considerable colony in Crete (Conybeare and Howson, vol. it. p. 475; and Lewin, vol. 2. p. 337). According to godliness (for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the pastoral Epistles, see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-2.htm">1 Timothy 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3, 5, 6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>, and notes).

The phrase is equivalent to "the fullness of the time" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Manifested his Word.</span> There is a change of construction. "The relative sentence passes almost imperceptibly into a primary sentence" (Buttmann in Huther); "his Word" becomes the object of the verb "made manifest," instead of "eternal life," as one would have expected. <span class="cmt_word">His Word</span> is the whole revelation of the gospel, including the Person and work of Jesus Christ. Compare St. Peter's address to Cornelius (<a href="../../par/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>). This "Word," which lay in the mind of God  through the ages, and was only dimly expressed in the promises given from time to time (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>), was now "<span class="accented">made</span> manifest," and proclaimed openly in that preaching of the gospel of God's grace which was entrusted to St. Paul. This same idea is frequently expressed (see <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>), <span class="cmt_word">In the message.</span> Surely a poor and a false rendering. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "by the open proclamation" which St. Paul, as God's herald, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, was commanded to make.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Were</span> for <span class="accented">are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appoint</span> for <span class="accented">ordain</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gave thee charge</span> for <span class="accented">had appointed thee</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Left I thee in Crete.</span> We have no account of St. Paul's visit to Crete, nor do we know how the gospel was first brought to Crete. It may have been by some of those "Cretes" who were at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, and heard the apostles speak in their tongue "the wonderful works of God" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a>), or by other Christian Jews visiting the Jewish community in Crete (note to ver. 1). If St. Paul was returning from Spain, and travelling by ship eastward, Crete would be on his way. The importance of the island, with which he made some acquaintance on his voyage from Caesarea to Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/27-7.htm">Acts 27:7, 8</a>), and the large Jewish colony there, may naturally have inclined him to visit it. How long he remained there we do not know, but he did not stay long enough to organize the Church there completely. There were still things "wanting" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), as it follows. This mention of Crete is an important chronological mark. The order of St. Paul's progress, as gathered from the three pastoral Epistles, is very distinct - Crete, Miletus, Troas, Macedonia, Corinth, Nicopolis, Rome. He dropped Titus at Crete, and left Timothy behind at Ephesus. The Epistle to Titus, therefore, is the first of the three pastoral Epistles, and this is borne out by another circumstance. When he wrote to Titus he had not made up his mind whether he should send Artemas or Tychicus to take his place in Crete when he rejoined the apostle (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>). But when he wrote 2 Timothy he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus to replace Timothy (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>), and Titus had already joined him, and been sent on by him to Dalmatia, presumably from Nicopolis. <span class="cmt_word">Set in order</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. nor in classical Greek, except as a technical word in the art of rhetoric. But <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is very common in classical Greek (<span class="accented">see</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The force of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> in the compound here is "further," or "in addition." St. Paul had set the Church in order up to a certain point. But there were still certain things wanting, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (see <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-22.htm">Luke 18:22</a>); and these Titus was to supply and give the finishing touch to. <span class="cmt_word">Appoint</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>). This is a better rendering than the A.V. "ordain," because it is a general word for "to appoint, make." Probably the A.V. "ordain" was not intended to be taken in a strictly technical sense, but is used as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a>. The technical word was usually "to order." "The Ordering of Deacons," or "of Priests," is the title of the service in the Book of Common Prayer. "Meet to be ordered," "shall surcease from ordering," occur repeatedly in the rubrics, <span class="cmt_word">Elders</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presbyters, or priests (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; and see <a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">In every city</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); city by city. The phrase has a peculiar significance in Crete, which used to be famous for its hundred cities. It shows, too, that Christianity was widely spread among the cities of the island. The germ of the episcopal office, one bishop and many presbyters, is here very conspicuous.

We learn also from <a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>; and elsewhere, what were the kind of questions which agitated the Judaizing Christians. But St. Paul in a few wise words shows the utter worthlessness of such controversies. "To the pure all things are pure." "There is nothing from without a man," said our Lord, "that entering into him can defile him" (<a href="../../par/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15</a>); "Neither if we cat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>); "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). But unto those that are defiled by what comes from within them, and have no faith (<a href="../../par/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>), nothing is pure. Their mind and conscience, being defiled, defile everything they do. The words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> are the proper words for ceremonial "cleanness" and "defilement" respectively.
