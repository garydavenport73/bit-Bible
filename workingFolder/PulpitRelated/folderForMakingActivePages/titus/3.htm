Christians were to show themselves good citizens, always ready for any duty to which they were called. Christianity was not to be an excuse for shirking duties, or refusing obedience where it was due. The only limit is expressed by the word "good." They were to give tribute to whom tribute was due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor; but, if ordered to do evil, then they must resist, and obey God rather than man (<a href="../../par/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>).

It is difficult to hit upon any conclusive argument for one side or the other.

We may conclude that Artemas (otherwise unknown) was the person eventually sent to Crete, as <span class="cmt_word">Tychicus</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>) we know went to Ephesus (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>). We have also an important note of time in this expression, showing clearly that this Epistle was written before the Second Epistle to Timothy (as it probably also was before 1 Timothy) - an inference abundantly corroborated by <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>, by which it appears that Titus had then actually joined St. Paul, either at Nicopolis or elsewhere, and had started off again to Dalmatia. <span class="cmt_word">Give diligence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>, note; 2 Timothy 4:9, 21. <span class="cmt_word">Nicopolis</span>, in Epirus. The most obvious reason for St. Paul's wintering at Nicopolis is that it was near Apollonia, the harbor opposite Brindisium, which would be his way to Rome, and also well situated for the missionary work in Dalmatia, which we learn from <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a> was in hand. Nicopolis (the city of victory) was built by Augustus Caesar to commemorate the great naval victory at Actium over Antony. It is now a complete ruin, uninhabited except by a few shepherds, but with vast remains of broken columns, baths, theatres, etc. (Lewin, vol. 2. p. 253). <span class="cmt_word">To winter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-11.htm">Acts 28:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>.

It is a probable conjecture of Lewin's that Apollos was the bearer of this letter, written at Corinth, and was on his way to Alexandria, his native place, taking Crete on the way.
