The special object of the present chapter is to prescribe the form, materials, colour, etc., of the holy garments - or the attire of those who were to minister in the tabernacle at the time of their ministration. As the service of the tabernacle was about to be committed to Aaron and his sons, their selection for this office is mentioned in verse 1, and their investiture and consecration briefly touched in verse 41. Otherwise the whole chapter is concerned with the attire That of Aaron is first prescribed (vers. 4-39). It consists of an ephod (vers. 6-12); a breastplate (vers. 13-30); a robe (vers. 31-35); a mitre (vers 36-38); a coat, or tunic; and a girdle (ver. 39). The dress of his sons follows. It comprises drawers (ver. 42), tunics, girdles, and caps or turbans (ver. 40). Incidentally it is mentioned in verse 43, that drawers are also to be worn by Aaron; and, in conclusion, the neglect of this ordinance in the case of either Aaron or his sons is forbidden under penalty of death <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thou unto thee</span>. Literally, "Make to draw near to thee." Moses had hitherto been of all the people the one nearest to God, <span class="accented">the</span> medium of communication. He was now to abdicate a portion of his functions, transferring them to his brother and his brother's sons. By this act he would draw them nearer to him than they were before. It is worthy of remark that he makes no remonstrance or opposition, but carries out God's will in this matter as readily and  willingly as in all others. (See <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-4.htm">Leviticus 8:4-30</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">From among the children of Israel</span>. The LXX. reads "And from among the children of Israel," as if others besides the family of Aaron had been admitted to the priesthood. But this is contrary to the entire tenor of the later narrative. The existing Hebrew text is correct. <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Abihu</span>, and again, <span class="cmt_word">Eleazar and Ithamar</span>, are always coupled together in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1, 12</a>; etc.), while a marked division is made between the two pairs of brothers. It is probably the sin and early death of the two elder (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) that causes the separation. Of Ithamar after the death of his brothers, nothing is known. Eleazar became high priest (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-17.htm">Numbers 34:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-4.htm">Joshua 17:4</a>; etc.).

In Moses' time probably no one thought of raising any objection to them. Priestly dresses of many different kinds were worn in Egypt, and some costume other than that of ordinary life, was probably affected by the priest class of every nation. Without entering into any elaborate "philosophy of clothes," we may say that the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of the matter would seem to be that expressed with great moderation by Richard Hooker - "To solemn actions of royalty and justice their suitable ornaments are a beauty. Are they in religion only a stain?" (See <span class="accented">Eccl. Pol</span>. 5:29, &sect; 1.) The garments ordered to be made for Aaron and his sons (ver. 41), are said to have been <span class="cmt_word">for glory and for beauty</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> "For glory." To exalt the priestly office in the eyes of the people - to make them look with greater reverence on the priests themselves and the priestly functions - to place the priests in a class by themselves, in a certain sense, above the rest of the nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> "For beauty." As fit and comely in themselves - suitable to the functions which the priests exercised - in harmony with the richness and beauty of the sanctuary wherein they were to minister. God, himself, it would seem, is not indifferent to beauty. He has spread beauty over the earth, fie will have beauty in his earthly dwelling-place. He requires men to worship him "in the beauty of holiness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-29.htm">1 Chronicles 16:29</a>). He ordains for his priests rich and splendid dresses "for glory and for beauty."

In modern parlance the heart is made the seat of the affections and emotions, the brain of the intellect. But the Hebrew idiom was different. There the heart was constantly spoken of as the seat of wisdom. (See below, <a href="../../par/exodus/31-6.htm">Exodus 31:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-10.htm">Exodus 35:10, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of wisdom</span> might seem to be scarcely necessary for the work of constructing a set of priestly garments; but where "glory and beauty" are required, high artistic power is needed; and this power is regarded by the sacred writers, as indeed it is by most of those who have written on the human understanding - notably Plato and Aristotle - as a very important part of the intellect. <span class="accented">Techne</span>, says Aristotle, involves <span class="accented">theoria</span>, as well as <span class="accented">aesthesis</span> and <span class="accented">genesis</span>, requires, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a knowledge of high abstract truths, as well as the perceptive faculty which we commonly call "taste," and the constructive one known as "power of execution." (See <span class="accented">Eth. Nic</span>. 6:4, &sect; 4.) It is, with him, one of the five chief intellectual excellences. <span class="cmt_word">To consecrate him</span>.

These were the same materials as those used for the veil (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>), and curtains (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 1, 36) of the sanctuary; but probably the fabric was of a more delicate quality. <span class="cmt_word">They shall take</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>," They," the wise-hearted men to whom the work was to be entrusted - "shall take," or receive from Moses - "the (necessary) gold, blue, purple," etc. In the original all these words have the definite article prefixed. <span class="accented">The Ephod</span>,

The ephod was a sort of jerkin or waistcoat, consisting of two pieces, one to cover the chest and the other the back, joined together probably by a seam, above the shoulders, and united at the waist by a band called "the curious girdle of the ephod." This band was of one piece with the ephod, being woven on either to the front or the back part; it held the other part in place, and was passed round  the body and fastened either with a clasp, or with buttons, or strings. <span class="cmt_word">Of gold, of blue, of purple</span>, etc. - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "of the same materials as the curtains and veil of the sanctuary, with the addition of gold." The gold was probably in the shape of gold thread, or wire of extreme tenuity, and was introduced by the needle after the fabric bad been woven, as was commonly done in Egypt (Herod. 3:47; Wilkinson's <span class="accented">Ancient Egyptians</span>, vol. 3. p. 128: compare below, <a href="../../par/exodus/39-3.htm">Exodus 39:3</a>). The white, blue, purple, and scarlet threads were doubtless woven into a pattern of some kind; but it is impossible to say what the pattern was. In Egypt patterns were not much affected, the dress worn being commonly white, with a stripe sometimes at the edge; but the Semitic tribes, who bordered Egypt on the East, affected gay colours and. varied designs, if we may trust the Egyptian wall-paintings. <span class="cmt_word">With cunning work</span>. Literally, "work of the skilled (workman)." Some of the Hebrews had evidently carried on the trade of weaving in Egypt, and had brought their looms with them. The Egyptian looms were hand-looms, and of no great size; they admitted of easy transport.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/28-9.htm">Exodus 28:9</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two onyx stones</span>. The correctness of this rendering has been much disputed. The LXX. give <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "emeraid." as the Greek equivalent in the present passage, while many argue for the beryl (Winer, Rosenmuller, Bollermann), and others for the sardonyx. This last rendering has the support of Josephus and Aquila. The sardonyx is, in fact, nothing but the best kind of onyx, differing from the onyx by having three layers - black, white, and red - instead of two  - black and white - only. When large, it fetches a high price, as much as a thousand pounds having been asked for one by a dealer recently. The probability is, that it is the stone here intended. It is an excellent material for engraving. With respect to the possibility of Moses having in the congregation persons who could engrave the sardonyx, we may remark that the Egyptians cut stones quite as hard, from a date long anterior to the exodus. <span class="cmt_word">Grave</span> <span class="cmt_word">on them the names of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the children of Israel</span>. Egyptian names are frequently found engraved on rings and amulets in hard stone; these rings and amulets date from the time of the twelfth dynasty. The names here intended are evidently the Israelite tribe names, which are reckoned as twelve, the double tribe of Joseph counting as one only. (Compare <a href="../../par/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>.)

It has been noticed that the ephod had for its main object or purpose to be a receptacle for the breast-plate which was attached to it after it had been put on, and formed its principal ornament. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">khoshen</span>, which is translated "breast-plate," means "ornament;" and the khoshen must certainly have been the most striking and brilliant object in the whole attire of the high priest. Externally, it did but repeat the symbolism of the ephod, exhibiting the high priest as the representative of the twelve tribes, whose names were engraved upon its twelve stones, as well as upon the onyxes of the ephod. Internally, it had, however, another, and a deeper import. It contained within it the Urim and the Thummim (ver. 30), by means of which God was consulted, and signified his will to his people. This must be regarded as its main end and use. It was from the <span class="accented">decisions</span> thus given that it received the name of "the breastplate (or ornament) of judgment." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ouches of gold</span>. "Buttons" according to one view (Cook): "sockets," according to another (Kalisch): "rosettes," according to a third (Keil). Some small ornament of open-work (see the comment on ver. 11), which could be sewn on to the ephod, and whereto a chain might be attached, seems to be intended. The object was to fasten the "breast-plate" firmly to the ephod. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/28-14.htm">Exodus 28:14</a></div><div class="verse">And two chains <i>of</i> pure gold at the ends; <i>of</i> wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At</span> <span class="cmt_word">the ends.</span> The meaning of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">migaloth</span> is very doubtful. Jarchi and Rosemuller approve of the rendering of our translators. Geddes, Boothroyd, and Dathe render "chains of equal length." Gesenius, Kalisch, Canon Cook, and others, believe the true meaning to be "wreathed," or "of wreathen work," so that the next clause, "after the manner of a rope," would be simply exegetic. <span class="cmt_word">Of wreathen work</span>.

See the introductory paragraph to this section. Kalisch translates "the breast-plate of <span class="accented">decision</span>." It was to be made, so far as its main fabric was concerned, of exactly the same materials as the ephod. See ver. 6.

It has been generally supposed that the doubling was merely for the purpose of giving additional strength to the work, which was to receive twelve heavy gems; but Gesenius and others are of opinion that the object was to form a bag, in which the Urim and Thum-mira, which they regard as material objects, might be kept. <span class="cmt_word">A span</span>.

Of these names the first only would seem to be tolerably certain. The second cannot be right, since the topaz was too hard a stone to be engraved by the ancient engravers. We may conjecture that the chrysolite, a pale stone not unlike the topaz, but far less hard, was the Genesis intended. The "carbuncle" is also thought to be wrong; and the "beryl" is suggested by some; by others "a sort of precious corundum." Emerald, to which the "smaragdus" of the LXX. and Josephus would seem to point, cannot be right, since that stone is fully as hard as the topaz.

A blue lace or ribbon was to be passed through each of the two lower rings, and these laces were to be tied to two rings, sewn for the purpose on to the front of the ephod a little above the "curious girdle" (vers. 26, 27). By these four fastenings at its four corners, the breast-plate was securely attached to the ephod, and could not readily get loose from it.

The breast and the shoulder were probably chosen as being conspicuous and honourable positions.

What exactly the two words represented is doubtful in the extreme. It has been supposed by some that they were not material objects, but a method by which God communicated his will; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, a miraculous light, or a miraculous voice. But such things as these could not have been put by Moses either "in," or "on the breastplate of judgment." Modern critics are generally agreed that the Urim and Thummim must have been material objects of one kind or another. The objects suggested are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The engraved stones of the breast-plate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Two small images, like the <span class="accented">teraphim</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A gold plate, engraved with the name of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Three plates or slips; one blank, one engraved with "yes," and one with "no." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Diamonds, cut and uncut, with marks engraved on them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against the first of these views it is urged with very great force that the present passage shows the Urim and Thummim to be something quite distinct from the breast-plate - something which was to be added to the breast-plate after all the stones had been set in it; and which Aaron was to bear upon his breast in addition to the breast-plate and its jewels (compare ver. 29 with ver. 30). Against the fourth and fifth, it is sufficient to observe that they are pure conjectures, without any basis of authority, either in Scripture or tradition. The second and the third remain. The third has important Jewish names in its favour, but is open to the objection that it makes a single object correspond to both words. The second alone seems to have any basis in Scripture, which certainly connects the use of <span class="accented">teraphim</span> with the use of an ephod (<a href="../../par/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-14.htm">Judges 18:14, 17, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>). On the whole, while admitting that there is no sufficient evidence to determine the question, we incline to regard the Urim and Thummim as small images, kept in the bag of the "breast-plate" (ver. 16), by means of which the high priest gave a decision when he was consulted. How the decision was arrived at, is an even more difficult problem than the one which we have attempted to solve. Some suppose the two images to have been used as lots, one giving an affirmative and the other a negative answer. Others imagine, that by gazing attentively upon them, and fixing his thoughts on the qualities which they symbolised - illumination and perfection - the high priest was thrown into an ecstatic state which enabled him to prophesy aright. The notion has even been started, that an angel spoke by their lips, and answered any question that was put to them. The truth seems to be that no theory on the subject can be more than a theory - quite arbitrary and conjectural - neither Scripture nor tradition furnishing any hint on the matter. If we knew how men divined from teraphim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>;  <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>), we might thence obtain some inkling of the truth, since there is much probability in the view, that the teraphim were employed as an unauthorised substitute for the Urim and Thummim. (See <a href="../../par/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 6, 14-20</a>.) But the method of this divination is wholly unknown. It is not however likely to have been a mere casting of lots, which is a very simple process, and requires no images; nor can this explanation of the decision by Urim and Thummim be regarded as having probability m its favour. Perhaps, of all the theories, that which supposes the Urim and Thummim to have been objects gazed at by the high priest until he entered the ecstatic state, is the least objectionable. It must not, however, be considered an essential part of this theory, that the material objects were derived from the religion of Egypt (Plumptre). The objects must have been well known to Moses and to those for whom he wrote; otherwise, they could not have been introduced, without any account of their nature, as," The Urim" and "The Thummim." They had probably been long possessed and consulted by the nation, which was accustomed to believe that it received enlightenment from them. Perhaps they were a sort of teraphim, but unconnected with any idolatrous worship. It is quite conceivable that an old usage, hitherto un-authorised, but not debased by any flagrant corruption, should have been adopted by Divine command into the Mosaic ritual, purified of any evil that attached to it, and consecrated to an important purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:31-35

Underneath the ephod and breast-plate the high priest was to wear a robe, or frock, wholly of blue. This robe was to have a hole for the head at the top, and was to be woven without seam (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-22.htm">Exodus 39:22</a>). It was put on over the head, like a habergeon or coat of mail, and probably reached below the knee. Josephus says that it had no sleeves. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All of blue</span>. This plainness and uniformity offered a strong contrast to the variegated hues of the breast-plate and ephod, and threw those portions of the attire into greater prominence.

The Assyrian bells are shaped almost exactly like our own. as are the classical ones.

Hebrew tradition gives a most uncertain sound with respect to the number of the bells. According to some, they were 12 only; according to others, 72; according to a third school, 3651 Equally conflicting are the explanations given of their symbolism - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that they typified the proclamation and expounding of the law by the high-priest - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that they were a musical offering of praise - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that they marked kingly dignity, since Oriental kings sometimes wore bells - and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that they were a call to vigilance and attention. This last view is supported by the words of verse 35 - <span class="cmt_word">it shall be upon Aaron to minister, and his sound shall be hoard</span>, or "that its sound may be heard." The bells were a means of uniting priest and people in one common service - they enabled the people to enter into and second what the priest was doing for them, and so to render his mediation efficacious - they made the people's worship in the court of the sanctuary a "reasonable service." And hence the threat, which certainly does not extend to <span class="accented">all</span> the priestly garments, implied in the words, "that he die not." If the high priest neglected to wear the robe with the bells, he separated himself off from the people; made himself their substitute and not their mouthpiece; reduced their worship to a drear formality; deprived it of all heartiness and life and vigour. For thus abusing his office, he would deserve death, especially as he could not do it unwittingly, for his ears would tell him whether he was wearing the bells or not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:36-38

Josephus tells us that the head-dress of the high priest was "not a conical cap, but a sort of crown, made of thick linen swathes" (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:7, &sect; 3). It was thus really a species of turban. The colour was white; and the only ornament on it was the gold plate, with its blue ribbon or fillet. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold</span>. The plate, though a mere ornament of the mitre, was, at once, its most conspicuous and its most significant feature. Placed directly in front, right over the forehead, and probably of burnished gold, it would attract universal attention, and catch the eye even more than the breast-plate. Its position made it "the culminating point of the whole priestly attire" (Kalisch) - and its inscription gave to that position extraordinary force and significance. For it taught that "<span class="cmt_word">holiness</span> <span class="cmt_word">to the Lord"</span> is the very highest crown and truest excellence of religion - that to which all ceremonial is meant to conduce - that without which all the paraphernalia of worship must ever be in God's sight a mockery. It set this truth conspicuously before the eyes, and was apt to impress it upon the hearts of all. It taught the high priest himself not to rest upon outward forms, but to aim in his own person, and teach the people to aim continually, at internal holiness. The extreme importance of this, causes the putting forward at once of the plate and its inscription before any account of the "mitre" is given.

Imperfection attaches to everything that man does; and even the sacrifices that the people offered to God required to be atoned for and purified. It was granted to the high priest in his official capacity to make the necessary atonement, and so render the people's gifts acceptable. For this purpose he was invested with an official holiness, proclaimed by the inscription upon the plate, which exhibited him as the type and representative of that perfectly Holy One, through whom alone can any real atonement be made to the Father. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be always upon his forehead</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whenever he ministers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:39

From the outer garments, which were the most important and distinctive, a transition is now made to the inner ones, in which there was nothing very remarkable. The linen drawers are for the present omitted, as not peculiar to the high priest. Directions are given for the tunic and the girdle. The former is to be woven in some peculiar way - so as to be diapered, as some think - and the latter is to be "the work of the embroiderer." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt embroider</span>. This is certainly not the meaning of the Hebrew. Some peculiar mode of weaving the coat is intended. <span class="cmt_word">The coat</span>. Rather, "the tunic" or "shirt." The <span class="accented">keloneth</span> was a long linen gown or cassock, worn immediately over the drawers. It reached to the feet, and had tightly-fitting sleeves (Joseph. <span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:7, &sect; 2). Whether it showed beneath the "robe of the ephod," or not, is uncertain; but the sleeves must certainly have been visible.

The girdle was worn directly over the linen shirt, and under "the robe of the ephod." It would seem that it was not seen at all, unless its ends hung down below "the robe of the ephod." It was however to be artistically embroidered (See <a href="../../par/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:40-43

The chapter concludes with brief directions concerning the official attire of the ordinary priests. This was to consist of linen drawers like those of the high priest; of a tunic, also of linen (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27</a>), shaped like his, but not diapered; of a linen girdle, the exact character of which is not stated; and of a close-fitting cap. The entire dress, with perhaps the exception of the girdle, was white. The linen drawers were regarded as of primary necessity, and the priest who did not wear them was threatened with death. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Aaron's sons</span>. His actual sons at this time - his descendants afterwards, to whom the priesthood was rigidly confined. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make coats</span>. The verb is different from that used in ver 39, and seems to imply that the priests' tunics were not to be patterned. <span class="cmt_word">Girdles</span>. It has generally been supposed that these were of the same material and workmanship as the high priest's; but this is nowhere stated. In <a href="../../par/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>, the high priest's girdle alone is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">Bonnets</span>. Certainly not "bonnets "in the modern sense. Plain, close-fitting caps, shaped like a cup, or rather basin, seem to be meant. Such caps were often worn in Egypt, but not by the priests. <span class="cmt_word">For glory and for beauty</span>. See above, ver. 2. It is very noticeable, that the extremely simple attire of the ordinary priests - a dress of pure white, without anything ornamental about it, unless it were the girdle - is still regarded as sufficient "for glory and for beauty." White robes have certainly a vast amount of scriptural testimony in their favour (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9, 14</a>, etc.).

On this point, see the comment on Exodus 29:7-9. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Linen breeches</span>. Rather, "linen drawers" (Kalisch), such as we see worn by the Egyptians generally, reaching from the waist to a little above the knee. (See Wilkinson in Rawlinson's <span class="accented">Herodotus</span>, vol. 2. p. 113, 2nd ed.) This also was of linen (Herod. 2:83). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the thighs</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the bottom of the thighs where they adjoin on the knee. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy <i>place</i>; that they bear not iniquity, and die: <i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation</span>. Literally," when they go into the tent of meeting - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the place where God and the high priest were to meet. <span class="cmt_word">The holy place</span>. The "holy place" seems in this passage to include the court of the tabernacle, wherein the altar was situated. <span class="cmt_word">That they bear not iniquity</span>. To "bear iniquity" is to incur guilt, or have sin imputed to one. If even through forgetfulness a priest entered the sanctuary without this necessary article of clothing, and so risked an unseemly, exposure of his person, he was to be accounted guilty, and punished by death. This was to be a "statute for ever," and to apply both to the high priest and the ordinary priests.
