The giving of the Book of the Covenant being now completed, Moses, having received directions with respect to another ascent into the mount (vers. 1, 2), descended to the people, and in the first instance declared to them the main heads of the Covenant, which they received with favour, and expressed their willingness to obey (ver. 3). Not, however, regarding this as a sufficiently formal ratification, the Prophet proceeded to write out in a "Book" the whole of the commands which he had received, He then built an altar, erected twelve pillars, offered sacrifice, and having collected half the blood of the victims in basins, summoned the people to an assembly. At this, he read over solemnly all the words of the Book to them, and received their solemn adherence to it (ver. 7); whereupon, to complete the ceremony, and mark their entrance into covenant, he sprinkled the blood from the basins on the twelve tribes, represented by their leaders, and declared the acceptance complete (ver. 8). The ceremony was probably modelled on some customary proceedings, whereby important contracts between man and man were ratified among the Hebrews and Syrians. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - It has been supposed that these verses are out of place, and suggested to remove them to the end of verse 8. But no change is necessary. It is quite natural that God should have given the directions before Moses descended from the mount, and that he should have deferred executing them until the people had accepted the covenant. <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Abihu</span> were the two eldest of Aaron's sons, and so his natural successors in the priesthood, had they not sinned by offering "strange fire" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1, 2</a>). They had been mentioned previously, in <a href="../../par/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Seventy of the elders</span>. On the elders of Israel, see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>, and Exodus 18:21. The "seventy" eiders may, together with Nadab and Abihu, have represented the twelve tribes, six from each. <span class="cmt_word">Worship</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye afar off</span>. Though all were to ascend the mount to a certain height, only Moses was to go to the top. The others, being less holy than Moses, had to worship at a distance.

Moses descended from the mount, and reported to the people <span class="cmt_word">all the words of the Lord</span> - all the legislation contained in the last three chapters and a half (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>, to <a href="../../par/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>), not perhaps in <span class="accented">extenso</span>, but as to its main provisions. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">all the people answered with one voice,</span> promising obedience. In times of excitement, a common impulse constantly animates an entire multitude, and an exaltation of feeling  leads them to make pledges, which they are very unwilling to stand by afterwards. Hence Moses requires something more than a verbal assent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses wrote all the words of the Lord</span>.

The Levitical priesthood not being as vet instituted, either all the people were regarded as holy, and so any one might offer sacrifice, or the "young men" selected may have been of the number of the first-born, who were priests in their respective families until the appointment of Aaron and his sons to be priests of the nation (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). No doubt young men were selected as most competent to deal with struggling animals.

The blood, which symbolised the life of the victim, was the essential part of every sacrifice, and was usually poured over the altar, or at any rate sprinkled upon it, as the very crowning act of offering. (See <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>; etc.) On this occasion Moses retained half of the blood, <span class="cmt_word">and put it in basins</span>, for the purpose of so uniting all the people in the sacrifice, and thereby the more solemnly pledging them to the covenant, which the sacrifice at once consecrated and consummated. (See <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18-20</a>.) The other <span class="cmt_word">half of the blood</span> was, according to the usual practice, <span class="cmt_word">sprinkled upon the altar</span>.

In this book we have the germ of the Holy Scriptures - the first "book" actually mentioned as written in the narrative of the Bible. Genesis may contain other older documents, inserted by Moses, under the sanction of the Holy Spirit, in his compilation. But his own composition, if we except the burst of poesy called forth by the passage of the Red Sea (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-18</a>), would seem to have commenced with "the Book of the Covenant." Upon this nucleus the rest of the law was based; and it was to explain and enforce the law that Moses composed the Pentateuch. <span class="cmt_word">In the audience of the people</span>, Literally, "in the ears of the people," which is equally intelligible, and more graphic. <span class="cmt_word">And they</span> <span class="cmt_word">said</span>, etc The people made the same answer as before (ver. 3), adding a general promise of obedience to all that God might command in future. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled <i>it</i> on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Moses then proceeded to the final act - He took the blood from the basins, <span class="cmt_word">and sprinkled it</span> - not certainly upon all the people, who numbered above two millions - but upon their leaders and representatives, the "elders" and other chief men, drawn up at the head of each tribe, and thus brought within his reach. It has been supposed by some that he merely sprinkled the blood on the twelve pillars, as representing the twelve tribes; but, had this been the case, the expression in the text would probably have been different. We read, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that he "sprinkled both the book, <span class="accented">and all the people"</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>). As he sprinkled, he said, <span class="cmt_word">Behold the blood of the covenant</span>, etc. It was a common practice among the nations of antiquity to seal covenants with blood. Sometimes the blood was that of a victim, and the two parties to the covenant prayed, that, if they broke it, his fate might be theirs (Hom. <span class="accented">1l.</span> 3:298; 19:252; Leviticus 1:24; 21:45; etc.). Sometimes it was the blood of the two parties themselves, who each drank of the other's blood, and thereby contracted a blood-relationship, which would have made their breaking the covenant more unpardonable (Herod. 1:74; 4:70; Tacit. <span class="accented">Ann</span>. 12:47). Moses seems to have followed neither practice at all closely, but, adopting simply the principle that a covenant required to be sealed with blood, to have arranged the details as he thought best. By the sprinkling of both the altar and the people the two parties to the covenant were made partakers of one and the same blood, and so brought into a sort of sacramental union. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 24:9-11 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - THE SACRIFICIAL FEAST AND THE VISION OF GOD. After the covenant had been ratified by the unanimous voice of the people, Moses proceeded to carry out the injunctions with respect to Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the elders, which he had received while still in the mount (see the comment on vers. 1, 2). Taking them with him, he ascended Sinai once more to a certain height, but clearly not to the summit, which he alone was privileged to visit (vers. 2 and 12). The object of the ascent was twofold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A sacrificial meal always followed upon a sacrifice; and the elders might naturally desire to partake of it as near the Divine presence as should be permitted them. This was their purpose in ascending. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> God desired to impress them with a sense of his awful majesty and beauty, and was prepared for this end to manifest himself to them in some strange and wonderful way as they were engaged in the solemn meal (ver. 11). This was his purpose in inviting their presence. The manifestation is described in ver. 10. It was a "vision of God," but of what exact nature it is impossible to say. Having recorded it, the author parenthetically notes that the Divine vision did not destroy any of those who beheld it, or cause them any injury, as might have been expected. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then went up</span>. Compare ver. 1. The mountain was to be partially ascended, but not to any great height. Nadab, Abihu, and the elders were to "worship God <span class="accented">afar off</span>." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they saw the God of Israel: and <i>there was</i> under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in <i>his</i> clearness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They saw the God of Israel</span>. These words can scarcely mean less than that they saw with their bodily eyes some appearance of the Divine being who had summoned them to his presence for the purpose. Moses, we know, saw a "similitude of God" (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). Isaiah "saw the Lord sitting upon his throne "(<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). Ezekiel saw upon the throne "the appearance of a man" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). It does not follow from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12, 15</a>, that <span class="accented">the elders</span> saw no similitude, since in that passage Moses is speaking, not to the elders, but to the people, and referring, not to what occurred at the sacrificial feast after the ratification of the covenant, but to the scene at the giving of the Ten Commandments previously (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-18</a>). What the form was which the elders saw, we are not told; but as it had "feet," it was probably a human form. It may have been hazy, indefinite, "too dazzling bright for mortal eye" to rest upon. But it was a true "vision of God"  - and, as Keil says, "a foretaste of the blessedness of the sight of God in eternity." <span class="cmt_word">There was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of a sapphire stone.</span> Rather, "and under his feet was, as it were, a work of clear sapphire." Nothing is said concerning a pavement, but only that below the feet of the figure which they saw was something, which looked as if it were made of bright blue sapphire stone, something as clear and as blue as the blue of heaven. Canon Cook  supposes the actual sky to be meant; but the expression, "<span class="accented">as it were</span>, the body of heaven," or "like the very heaven," makes this impossible. A thing is not like itself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a></div><div class="verse">And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The nobles</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the notables - the seventy elders, and other persons, already mentioned (vers. 1, 9). <span class="cmt_word">He laid not his hand</span>. God did not smite them with death, or pestilence, or even blindness. It was thought to be impossible to see God and live. (See above, <a href="../../par/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22, 23</a>, etc.) Man was unworthy to draw near to God in any way; and to look on him was viewed as a kind of profanity. Yet some times he chose to show himself, in vision or otherwise, to his people, and then, as there could be no guilt on their part, there was no punishment on his. It is generally supposed that, in all such cases, it was the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity who condescended to show himself. <span class="cmt_word">Also they saw God</span>. Rather, "they both saw God, and did eat and drink." The two were simultaneous. As they were engaged in the sacrificial meal, God revealed himself to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 24:12-18 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - MOSES' ENTRY INTO THE CLOUD, AND FORTY DAYS' COMMUNE WITH GOD. It was necessary now that Moses should receive full directions for the external worship of God, the sanctuary, and the priesthood. Every religion has something tangible and material about it - holy places, holy things, rites, ceremonies, rules, forms, regulations. If man sets himself to devise these things of his own head, he may very easily go wrong, and find his elaborate inventions "an offence" to God. To avoid this - to secure the result that  all should be pleasing and acceptable to "the High and Holy One which inhabiteth eternity," it was thought fitting that "patterns" should be shown to Moses of all that was to be made for the worship (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>), and exact details given him with respect to the material, size, shape, and construction of each. The results are put before us in seven chapters (chs. 25-31.). For the purpose of allowing ample time for the communications which had to be made and of securing that undivided attention which was requisite in order that all should remain fixed in the memory, God summoned his servant to a long and solitary colloquy, on the mountain summit whereon the cloud rested (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), apart from all his people. Moses, of course, obeyed; but before ascending, arranged with the elders that in his absence Aaron and Hur should have the direction of affairs, and decide all doubtful questions (ver. 14). He then went up the mountain, accompanied for part of the way by Joshua, who is now spoken of as his "minister," or "attendant" (ver. 13). Joshua probably remained with him for six days, while Moses waited for a summons to enter the cloud. On the seventh day the summons came: and Moses, leaving Joshua, entered the cloud, and was hid from the sight of all men. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come up to me</span>. Moses, apparently, had descended again into the plain, with Aaron and the seventy elders, after the festival was over. (See ver. 14, and compare <a href="../../par/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>.) He is now commanded to reascend, <span class="cmt_word">and be</span> <span class="cmt_word">there</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "And continue there"  - foreshadowing the length of the stay. <span class="cmt_word">Tables of stone, and a law, and commandments</span>, etc. Literally, "Tables of stone, and <span class="accented">the</span> law and the commandments which I have written." The three expressions alike refer to the Decalogue, which alone God <span class="accented">wrote</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest teach them</span>. Rather," to teach them." God wrote the commandments on stone, in order to inculcate them with the greater force upon his people.

This time he was attended by <span class="cmt_word">his minister, Joshua</span>, whose arm he had employed on a former occasion against the Amalekites (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-13</a>).

The summons had been given to Moses, and he had obeyed it. He was there on the platform a little below the summit, ready, but waiting for a further call. The call was not made for six days. A holy calm reigned upon Sinai - the cloud rested upon the summit, and in the cloud was <span class="cmt_word">the glory of the Lord</span>. Moses and Joshua waited near - but for six days there was no sign. God thus taught Moses, and through him the world, that near approach to him requires long and careful preparation. Moses, no doubt, was occupied during <span class="cmt_word">the six days</span> in continual prayer. At last, <span class="cmt_word">on the seventh day</span>, the call, which Moses had expected, came. <span class="cmt_word">God called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</span>.
