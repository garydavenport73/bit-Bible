The kindling of fire in early times involved considerable labour. It was ordinarily affected by rubbing two sticks together, or twisting one round rapidly between the two palms in a depression upon a board. Fire only came after a long time. Moreover, as in the warm climate of Arabia and Palestine artificial warmth was not needed, fire could only have been kindled there for cooking purposes, which involved further unnecessary work, and had already been forbidden (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>). The Karaite Jews still maintain the observance of this precept to the letter, even in cold climates, as in that of the Crimea, and allow neither fire nor light in their houses on the sabbath day; but the Jews generally view the precept as having had only a temporary force, and have lights and fires, like other persons, even in Palestine. Strict Jews, however, still cook no food on the sabbath day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 35:4-20

Having warned the Israelites against breaches of the sabbath, Moses proceeded to enumerate the offerings which God had said that they might bring (vers. 4-9), and the works which he had required to be constructed (vers. 10-19). In the former enumeration, he follows exactly the order and wording of the Divine command to himself, as recorded in <a href="../../par/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3-7</a>; in the latter, he changes the order, mentioning first the building, with its component parts (ver. 11), then the contents of the building (vers. 12-15), then the court with its contents (vers. 16, 17) together with some details which had been omitted in the former account (ver. 18), and finally the holy garments (ver. 19).

Moses dismissed the people; but they soon began to return, bringing their offerings with them. There was a general, if not a universal, willingness Men and women alike "brought bracelets (brooches?), and earrings, and rings, and armlets - all articles of gold," and offered them to the Lord (ver. 22). Others brought blue and purple and scalier and fine linen, and goats' hair and rams' skins dyed red, and badger (or rather, seal) skins (ver. 23). Silver and bronze and shittimwood were contributed by others (ver. 24). The women, who were the only spinners, brought their spun yarn of blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen, and their yarn of goats' hair (vers. 25, 26); while the richest class of all - "the rulers" - gave, as their contribution, the onyx stones for the ephod, the jewels for the high-priest's breastplate, and the oil needed for the light, together with rare spices for the anointing ointment and the incense (vers. 27, 28). Subsequently, we are told that what was contributed was "much more than enough" (<a href="../../par/exodus/36-5.htm">Exodus 36:5</a>), and that the people had to be "restrained from bringing" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord's offering</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "their offering to Jehovah." <span class="cmt_word">For all</span> <span class="cmt_word">his service</span>. The use of "his" for "its" causes an unfortunate ambiguity here. The antecedent to the pronoun is not the Lord, but the tabernacle.

That among the Hebrews gold ornaments were worn by men, as well as by women, is indicated by <a href="../../par/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>, and <a href="../../par/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>. The Egyptian men at the time of the Exodus wore armlets, bracelets, and sometimes anklets, but not often earrings Earrings, however, had been worn by the household of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bracelets</span>. Rather, "buckles" or "brooches." Kalisch says, "nose-rings," and so Gesenins and Rosenmuller. <span class="cmt_word">Tablets</span>. Rather, "armlets" (Furst, Cook), or perhaps "necklaces "(Gesenius Kalisch, Knobel). <span class="cmt_word">Every man that offered, offered an offering of gold</span>. It is not meant that every man who offered anything gave with it an offering of gold, but simply that, besides those who brought the articles named there were others who brought gold offerings of some different kind.

The words are the same as those translated "rams' skins dyed red" in <a href="../../par/exodus/25-5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>. The earlier rendering is the better one. <span class="cmt_word">Badger skins</span>. Rather, "seal skins." See the comment on Exodus 25:5.

It would seem that silver was offered by some in the way of a free-will offering, in addition to the compulsory half-shekel (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>). Curiously, however, the amount obtained in this way is not given in <a href="../../par/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-29</a>.

Though, in some real sense, "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians," still Moses was probably devoid of the technical knowledge requisite for a "superintendent of the works" on the present occasion. At any rate, his other duties imperatively required that he should decline to undertake, in addition to them, so onerous an office. And God had told him whom it would be best for him to set over the work (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>). Accordingly, he now made known to the people that the construction of the tabernacle and its appurtenances would be committed to two men - Bezaleel, the son of Uri, as principal, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, as his assist-ant - who would "teach" those under them what they were to do (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath called</span>, etc See <a href="../../par/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>: - "I have called by name Bezaleel," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Judah</span>.
