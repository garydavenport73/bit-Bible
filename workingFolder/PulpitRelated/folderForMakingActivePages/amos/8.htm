The word <span class="accented">chelub</span> is taken to mean "a basket of wickerwork;" it is used for "a cage" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a>, but is found nowhere else. The gathering of fruit was the last harvest of the year, and thus fitly typified the final punishment of Israel. This is set forth by the play on the word in the next verse.

These shall be changed into <span class="cmt_word">howlings</span> of lamentation for the dead which lie around (comp. ver. 10). There shall be <span class="cmt_word">many dead bodies</span>. The Hebrew is more forcible: "Many the corpses: in every place he hath cast them forth. Hush!" The Lord is represented as casting dead bodies to the ground, so that death is everywhere; and the interjection "hush!" (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>) is an admonition to bend beneath the hand of an avenging God (comp. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a>). Orelli takes it as an expression of the apathy that accompanies severe and irremediable suffering - suffering too deep for words. The Greek and Latin versions take this onomatopoetic word has! "hush!" as a substantive. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "I will cast upon them silence;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">projicietur silentium</span> - an expressive rendering, but one not supported by grammatical considerations.

Coined money of determined value seems not to have been used before the return from Captivity, all payments of fixed amount previous to that period being made by weighing (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/43-21.htm">Genesis 43:21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Falsifying the balances by deceit</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">dealing falsely with balances of deceit.</span> To increase their gains they falsified their scales or used fraudulent weights (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>).

Some have suggested that the prophet here predicts the latter in the year of Jeroboam's death; but this, it is discovered, would have been so partial as hardly to be noticeable at Samaria. And it is improbable that such natural phenomena, unconnected with God's moral government, should be the subject of the prophet's prediction (Pusey). Doubtless a sudden reverse is signified (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>, etc.), expressed in terms rendered particularly appropriate by some late and well remembered eclipse.

Some commentators, ancient and modern, think that the actual road which led to Beersheba is here meant, and would translate, "As the way to Beersheba liveth," "By the life of the way to Beersheba," as Mohammedans swear by the pilgrimage to Mecca. But it is best to take the word rendered "manner" in the sense of "way," as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used in Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>) for mode of worship, or form of religion, the ritual, or use of the service there. (For Beersheba, see note on Amos 5:5.) From Dan to Beersheba is just a hundred and forty-four miles. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fall,</span> etc. This was partially fulfilled by the destruction of the kingdom of Israel and the deportation of its inhabitants; and its truth to this day is demonstrated by the fate of the Jews who will not receive Jesus as the promised Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../amos/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Amos 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Amos 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../amos/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Amos 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Amos 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
