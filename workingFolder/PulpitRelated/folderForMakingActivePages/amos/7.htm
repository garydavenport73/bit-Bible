FIVE VISIONS, WITH EXPLANATIONS, CONTINUING AND CONFIRMING THE PREVIOUS PROPHECY. The afflictions are climactic, increasing in intensity. The first two symbolize judgments which have been averted by the prophet's intercession; the third and fourth adumbrate judgments which are to fall inevitably; and the fifth proclaims the overthrow of the temple and the old theocracy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 1. <span class="accented">The first vision, of locusts, represents Israel as a field eaten down to the ground, but shooting up afresh, and its utter destruction postponed at the prophet's prayer.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me.</span> By an inward illumination (comp. vers. 4, 7; and <a href="../../par/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He formed grasshoppers;</span> rather, <span class="accented">locusts</span> (<a href="../../par/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>). This points to the moral government of God, who uses nature to work his purposes, "wind and storm fulfilling his word." <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;</span> when the aftermath was beginning to grow under the influence of the latter rains. If the herbage was destroyed then, there would be no hope of recovery in the rest of the year. <span class="cmt_word">After the king's mowings.</span> It is deduced from this expression that the first crop on certain grounds was taken for the king's use - a kind of royal perquisite, though there is no trace of such a custom found in Scripture, the passage in <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a>, where Ahab sends Obadiah to search for pasture, having plainly nothing to do with it; and in this case, as Keil remarks, the plague would seem to fall upon the people only, and the guilty king would have escaped. But to interpret the expression entirely in a spiritual sense, with no substantial basis, as "Jehovah's judgments," destroys the harmony of the vision, ignoring its material aspect altogether. It is quite possible that the custom above mentioned did exist, though it was probably limited to certain lands, and did not apply to the whole pasturage of the country. It is here mentioned to define the time of the plague of locusts - the time, in fact, when its ravages would be most irremediable. The LXX., by a little change of letters, render, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, by which they imply that the locusts would be as innumerable as the army of Gog. The whole version is, "Behold, a swarm of locusts coming from the East; and behold, one caterpillar, King Gog." The vision is thought to refer to the first invasion by the Assyrians, when Pul was bribed by Menahem to withdraw.

The punishment was conditioned by man's behaviour or other considerations. Here the prophet's intercession abates the full infliction of the penalty (compare analogous expressions, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-11.htm">1 Samuel 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-8.htm">Jeremiah 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>, where see note). Amos may have had in memory the passage in <a href="../../par/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>.

Hence some early commentators gathered that the prophet's  intercession was rejected; but the words do not necessarily bear that sense (see St. Cyril Alex. and Theodoret, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be.</span> This respite refers to the retreat of the Assyrians under Pul, the usurping monarch who assumed the name of Tiglath-Pileser II. (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-17.htm">2 Kings 15:17</a>, etc.). Some commentators consider the judgment to be literally plague of locusts; but this is not probable.

Rather, the portion (not a part) is that part of the land and people which was marked out for judgment. The particular calamity alluded to is the second invasion of Tigiath-Pileser II, when he conquered Gilead and the northern part of the kingdom, and carried some of the people captive to Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>).

As the word in other dialects means tin or lead, it is usually taken here to mean the plumb line which builders use to ascertain that their work is even and perpendiculur (see a very different explanation in Knabenbauer, p. 314, etc.). The "wall" is the kingdom of Israel, once carefully built up, solidly constructed, accurately arranged. God had made it upright; how was it now?

Jeroboam II. had roved Israel from Syria, and was popular owing to his success in war (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>); but his dynasty was overthrown, and this overthrow was the destruction of the Israelitish monarchy. The murder of his son Zachariah by Shallum (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>) led to those disastrous commotions which culminated in the conquest of Samaria by the Assyrians and the deportattion of the people.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">This bold prophecy, no longer conceived in general terms or referring to distant times, but distinct and personal, arouses the animosity of the priestly authorities at Bethel, who accuse Amos before the king, and warn him to leave the country without more words, or to fear the worst.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amaziah the priest of Bethel.</span> Amaziah ("the Lord is strong"), the chief of the idol priests at Bethel, a crafty and determined man, hearing this prophecy against the royal house, takes it up as a political matter, and makes a formal accusation against Amos with the view of silencing him. <span class="cmt_word">Hath conspired against thee.</span> Probably some of the Israelites had been convinced by the prophet's words, and had joined themselves to him; hence Amaziah speaks of "a conspiracy" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>) against the king.

Amaziah carefully omits the fact that Amos had merely been the mouthpiece of God in all his announcements; he says falsely that a violent death had been predicted for Jeroboam himself; and, in stating that Amos had foretold the captivity of Israel, he says nothing of the sins which led to this doom, or of the hope held out to repentance, or of the prophet's intercession.

Jeroboam appears to have taken no steps in consequence of this accusation, either deeming that the words of a visionary were unworthy of serious consideration, or, like Herod (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>), fearing the people, who had been impressed by the prophet's words and bold bearing. Therefore Amaziah endeavours by his own authority to make Amos leave the country, or else does not wait for the command of the king, who was probably at Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">O thou seer!</span> Amaaiah calls Amos <span class="accented">chozeh</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-9.htm">1 Chronicles 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>), either with reference to the visions just given, or in derision of his claims - as we might say, "visionary." <span class="cmt_word">Flee thee away;</span> fly for thine own good to escape punishment, patronizing and counselling him. <span class="cmt_word">Go to the land of Judah;</span> where doubtless your announcement of the ruin of the rival kingdom will be acceptable. <span class="cmt_word">Eat bread.</span> Amaziah speaks, as if Amos was paid for his prophecies, made a gain of godliness. <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy there.</span> "Vaticinare in terra Jude, ubi libenter audiuntur insani" (St. Jerome). The idoloatrous priest has no conception of the inspiration under which the prophet speaks. He judges others by himself, attributing to Amos the sordid motives by which he himself was influenced.

The Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "pricking sycamore fruit," and that of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">vellicans sycomoros</span>, indicate the artificial means for ripening the fruit, which was done by scraping, scratching, or puncturing it, as is sometimes done to the figs of commerce. As the tree bore many crops of fruit in the year, it would afford constant employment to the dresser (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' 3. p. 1394; 'Bible Educator,' 4, p. 343). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/7-15.htm">Amos 7:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As I followed;</span> literally, <span class="accented">from after from behind</span>, as in the call of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>), The Divine call came to him suddenly and imperatively, and he must needs obey it. He, therefore, could not follow Amaziah's counsel.

St. Jerome's explanation is somewhat too subtle, "<span class="accented">Stillare prophetas idioma Scripturarum est, quod non totam Dei simul inferant iram, sed parvas stillas comminatione denuntient."</span>
