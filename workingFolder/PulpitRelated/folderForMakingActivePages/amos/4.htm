Some have supposed that by this term are meant the luxurious nobles of Samaria, who are called "cows" as being effeminate and licentious. This is possible; but such grandees would be called rather "bulls of Bashan," and the "masters" mentioned just below signify more naturally these women's husbands than the kings. Pussy notes that the genders in the sentence are interchanged. "Hear <span class="accented">ye</span>," "<span class="accented">your</span> Lord," "upon <span class="accented">you</span>," "they shall take <span class="accented">you</span>," being masculine; "<span class="accented">that</span> oppress," "<span class="accented">that</span> crush," "<span class="accented">that</span> say<span class="accented"></span>," "<span class="accented">your</span> posterity," "<span class="accented">ye</span> shall go out," "<span class="accented">each</span> before <span class="accented">her</span>," "<span class="accented">ye</span> shall cast," feminine. Evidently the prophet addresses his reproaches to the luxurious of both sexes, though he begins with the women. The land of Bashan extended from Hermon to the Jabbok, including Gaulonitis, Auronitis, Batauea, and Trachonitis. It was always famous for its pasturage, cattle, and oaks. The Vulgate takes the term as metaphorical, and has, <span class="accented">vaccae pingues.</span> So Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, which translation Jerome adopts. <span class="cmt_word">Mountain of Samaria.</span> The hill of Shomer, on which Samaria was built (see note on ch. 3:9). <span class="cmt_word">Oppress the poor.</span> This they did in ministering, or getting their husbands to minister, to their luxury and debauchery.

The Hebrew expression <span class="accented">haharmonah</span> occurs nowhere else. Our version takes it in the sense of <span class="accented">armon</span>, "a palace," intending probably a palace or citadel of the enemy, which certainly ought to have been expressed. Kimchi renders, "Ye shall cast yourselves into the palace of the king." The passage is probably corrupt. If the verb is taken as passive, the unusual word must be considered to denote the place of banishment. Thus, "Ye shall be cast forth into Harmon." Whether Harmon means Armenia, as many ancient commentators thought, or not, cannot be determined. Various opinions may be seen in Keil, Schegg, Trochon, and others; but the simplest explanation is that of Orelli and Ewald, viz. that each fugitive shall fling away her idol Rimmona (the wife of the god Rimmon, <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>), in order to be more free for flight (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, <i>and</i> your tithes after three years:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The prophet now turns to Israel, and ironically bids them exhibit their zeal for idolatry, and thus increase their guilt. <span class="cmt_word">Bethel</span>; as the chief seat of idol worship (<a href="../../par/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At Gilgal;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to Gilgal</span>, "come ye" being repeated in thought. Gilgal was a strong position in the plain of Jordan, three miles east of Jericho, taking its name probably from the stone circles erected for purposes of worship in very early times. Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>) gave a new meaning to the old name. There is a large pool of water in this neighbourhood called Jil-julieh, about four miles from the Jordan, which is doubtless a corruption of the ancient name Gilgal. It seems to have been regarded as a holy place in Samuel's days or even before (see <a href="../../par/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 13:8, etc.);   and later was appropriated to false worship, though we have no information as to the date of this declension. Gilgal and Bethel are associated together in idolatrous worship (<a href="../../par/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> and in <a href="../../par/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bring your sacrifices every morning.</span> They were careful to maintain the outward semblance of the regular Levitical worship, even beyond the letter of the Law in some respects, though their service was all the time idolatry. As this and the following clause are still ironical, Amos is speaking, not of the daily-prescribed sacrifice (<span class="accented">olah</span>, <a href="../../par/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>), but of the offerings (<span class="accented">zebach</span>) of individual Israelites which were not required to be presented every day. <span class="cmt_word">Your tithes after three years;</span> literally, <span class="accented">on the</span> <span class="accented">three of days</span>; <span class="accented">lishlosheth yamim</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">tribus diebus</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "every third day." Revised Version, "every three days." So Gesenius, Ewald, Keil, Schegg, Hitzig, Baur. The prophet bids them bring their tithes, not as the Law ordered, every year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>), or, as in the case of the second tithe, every three years (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), but, by an ironical exaggeration, "every three days." Dr. Pusey defends the English Version on the ground of the idiomatic use of "days" for one circle of days, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7</a>). But this loses the irony which is so marked in the whole passage. Keil, "If ye would offer slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days, ye would only thereby increase your apostasy from the living God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/4-5.htm">Amos 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim <i>and</i> publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven;</span> more definitely, <span class="accented">offer by burning a thank offering of that which is leavened.</span> This is an alteration of the prescribed ritual in two particulars. The Law forbade leaven in any meat offering consumed by fire (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>); and if it allowed cakes of leavened bread to be offered on one occasion, these were not to be placed on the altar and burned, but one was to be assigned to the officiating priest, and the rest eaten at the sacrificial meal (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13, 14</a>). The ironical charge to the Israelites is that in their unlicensed zeal they should not only burn on the altar that which was leavened, but, with the idea of being more bountiful, they should also offer by fire that which was to be set apart for other uses. The Septuagint Version can only be explained by considering the translators to have had a different reading, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "and they read the Law without." <span class="cmt_word">Proclaim...  publish.</span> Make public proclamation that free will offerings are to be made, or else, like the Pharisees (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>), announce with ostentation that you are about to offer. The essence of such offerings was that they should be voluntary, not of command or compulsion (<a href="../../par/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>).

This is the first chastisement mentioned.

The famines to which Amos alludes are not recorded. Plainly they were not fortuitous, but were providential inflictions, in accordance with previous warnings <span class="cmt_word">Yet have ye not returned unto me.</span> Pusey notes that the words imply, not that they returned not at all, but that they did after a fashion return, but not so as to reach God, their repentance being a half-repentance and their worship a half-worship, and therefore unacceptable.

We do not know anything about the particular earthquake to which the prophet alludes. (For an exhaustive catalogue of the earthquakes in this country, see Pusey's notes on this verse.) <span class="cmt_word">As God overthrew.</span> The substitution of the name of God for the personal pronoun, when the Lord himself is speaking, is not uncommon in Hebrew. Here it rather takes the form of a quotation from Genesis. <span class="cmt_word">Ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning</span> (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, where see note) - a phrase which implies, not only a narrow escape, but an escape accompanied with loss. The "brand" not wholly consumed is yet blackened and diminished by the burning (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>).

Make ready to meet thy God in judgment, turning to him with changed heart, if perchance he may forgive thee and withdraw his heavy hand. Another explanation, derived from Symmachus and adopted by a Lapide, Schegg, and others, "Praeparare ut adverseris Deo tuo" - an ironical encouragement to them to withstand God - deprives the following verse of its suitability to the context. For the prophet would hardly invite them to this contest by expatiating upon God's almightiness.

Many of the Fathers have seen here a prophesy of the Messiah. See Tirinus and Corn. a Lapide on this verse. <span class="cmt_word">That maketh the morning darkness.</span> Keil, after Calvin, takes these words as asyndeton for "the morning dawn and darkness." So the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "making morning and gloom." This would be simply a further instance of God's creative power. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">faciens matutinam nebulam</span>; and it seems probable (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>) that the clause means that the Lord turns the dawn into darkness. This may refer to the action of clouds or an eclipse; or it may be said metaphorically of prosperity and adversity. <span class="cmt_word">Treadeth upon the high places of the earth.</span> An anthropomorphic representation of the might and majesty of God, who governs all things, and has the loftiest in perfect subjection (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord,</span> Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, covenant God, is he who in these things manifests himself, and therefore his threats are not to be despised (<a href="../../par/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>).
