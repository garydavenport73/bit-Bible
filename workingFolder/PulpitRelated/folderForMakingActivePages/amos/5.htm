(Vers. 1-3.) He calls her to repentance, while he shows wherein she has declined from the right way. To make this plain, he contrasts God's power and majesty with the people's iniquity, instances of which he gives (vers. 4-12). The only condition of safety is amendment (vers. 13-15); and as they refuse to reform, they shall have cause to lament (vers. 16, 17). This threat is enforced by the two emphatic "woes" that follow, the first of which demonstrates the baselessness of their trust in their covenant relation to God (vers. 18-27); the second denounces the careless lives of the chiefs, who, revelling in luxury, believed not in the coming judgment (<a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1-6</a>). Therefore they shall go into captivity, and the kingdom shall be utterly overthrown (vers. 7-11), because they act iniquitously and are self-confident (vers. 12-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye this word.</span> To show the certainty of the judgment and his own feeling about it, the prophet utters his prophecy in the form of a dirge (<span class="accented">kinah</span>, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which I take up against you;</span> or, <span class="accented">which I raise over you</span>, as if the end had come.

A spot about fifty miles southsouthwest of Jerusalem, the site of which has never been lost, and is marked to this day by seven much-frequented wells. As being one of the holy places celebrated in the history of the patriarchs (<a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-23.htm">Genesis 26:23</a>, etc.; Genesis 46:1), it had become a shrine of idolatrous worship, to which the Israelites resorted, though it lay far out of their territory (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal shall surely go into captivity.</span> There is in the Hebrew a play on the words here and in the following clause (<span class="accented">Hag-gilgal galoh yigleh</span>), which commentators have paralleled with such expressions as, <span class="accented">Capua capietur, Cremona cremabitur, Paris perira</span>, "London is undone."

No mention is made of the fate of Beersheba, because Amos has in view only the ten tribes, and the destiny of places beyond their territory is not here the object of his prediction; and indeed, when Israel was ruined, Beersheba escaped unharmed.

Who make judgment the occasion of the bitterest injustice. There is no syntactical connection between this verse and the last, but virtually we may append it to "seek the Lord."

This and the following clause do not simply state that the regular interchange of day and night is in God's hands, but rather notify that God is a moral Governor of the world. He saves men from the utmost dangers, from the darkness of sin and from the night of ignorance; and, on the other hand, he sends calamity on those that offend his Law (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Maketh the day dark with night;</span> literally, as the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "darkeneth day into night." <span class="cmt_word">That calleth for the waters of the sea,</span> etc. As judgments are the prophet's theme, this expression cannot be an intimation of the working of the natural law by which the moisture taken up from the sea as cloud returns upon the earth as rain (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>). Rather it is an allusion to the Flood and similar catastrophes, which are proofs of God's judicial government of the universe, when "he maketh the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies" (Wisd. 5:17). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is his Name.</span> Jehovah, the self-existent God, doeth all these marvellous things, and men presume to scout his Law and think to be unpunished (<a href="../../par/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>).

We may add that Rosenmuller agrees with the Authorized Version in the first clause: "Who strengtheneth the weak against the strong, and giveth the plunderers power over the fortresses of the strong."

It seems better to take the words thus than to join "in the gate" to "they hate," with the meaning that those who resort to the gate - kings, chiefs, judges - hate the prophet's reproof, for the following verses show that Amos is referring chiefly to judicial proceedings, and not to his own mission. <span class="cmt_word">Uprightly</span>; literally, <span class="accented">perfectly</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">perfecte</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without reserve, keeping nothing back.

Hitzig, Keil, with many ancient commentators, find in it a threat of chastisement, "the flooding of the land with judgment and the punitive righteousness of God." Pusey, Professor Gandell, and others consider it to be a call to amendment. "He bids them let judgment, which had hitherto been perverted in its course, roll on like a mighty tide of waters, sweeping before it all hindrances," filling the whole land with righteousness. Schegg makes it to be a promise of the coming of the day of the Lord, that is, the revelation of Messiah. But such a promise in this position is very forced and unnatural. The second interpretation seems most suitable. In the midst of the denunciation of men's formal worship, the prophet announces their duty in the present crisis, attention to which could alone win God's favour. Judgment and righteousness, long neglected and forgotten, should permeate the land like refreshing streams of water - a simile of special signification to an inhabitant of an Eastern country, where the neighbourhood of a perennial stream was as delightful as it was unusual. <span class="cmt_word">Mighty</span> (<span class="accented">ethan</span>); <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "impassable" (Septuagint); <span class="accented">fortis</span> (Vulgate).

"Whence the seventh month, just before the early rain, was called the month <span class="accented">Ethanim, i.e.</span> the month of <span class="accented">the perennial streams</span>, when they alone flowed" (Pusey).

It is certain, too, that during the sojourn in the wilderness sacrificial worship fell greatly into desuetude, as we know that the rite of circumcision was suspended (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5-7</a>), the Passover was not duly celebrated, and Joshua urged  the people to put away the strange gods from among them (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>).

Aquila gives <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>: Theodotion, "vision," reading the whole sentence thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Many moderns render, "stake," "column," or "shrine." Others suppose it to be equivalent to <span class="accented">Sakkuth</span>, an Assyrian name for Molech (or Adar); but this is very uncertain (see 'Studien und Kritiken.' 1874, p. 887), sad the parallelism requires the word to be an appellative and not a proper name. It most probably means "shrine," a portable shrine, like those spoken of in <a href="../../par/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a> in connection with the worship of Diana. The Syriac and Arabic versions call it "tent," and thus the reproach stands forth emphatically that, instead of, or in conjunction with, the true tabernacle, they bore aloft, as if proud of their apostasy, the tabernacle of a false god. Such shrines were used by the Egyptians, according to Herodotus (2:63, where see Rawlinson's note) and Diod. Sic. (1:97). Many such may be seen in the Egyptian room of the British Museum. Keil quotes Drumann, 'On the Rosetta Inscription,' p. 211, "These were small chapels, generally gilded and ornamented with flowers and in other ways, intended to hold a small idol when processions were made, and to be carried or driven about with it." Hence we must look to Egypt as the source of this idolatry. <span class="cmt_word">Moloch</span>, though sanctioned by the LXX. and St. Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>), is a mistranslation. De Rossi, indeed, mentions that one Hebrew manuscript gives <span class="accented">Moloch</span>, but the received reading is <span class="accented">Melkekem</span>, which is confirmed by Symmachus and Theodotion, who have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Syriac. The translation, therefore, should run, "Ye took up the shrine of your king," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of him whom ye made your king in the place of Jehovah, meaning some stellar divinity. <span class="cmt_word">And Chiun your images;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fec;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "and the star of your god Raephan "(Septuagint); <span class="accented">et imaginem idolorum vestrorum</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the kiyyun of your images.</span> The parallelism again requires us to take this unknown word as an appellative; and according to its probable derivation, its meaning is "pedestal," or "framework," that on which the image stood. The Greek rendering is, as Keil thinks, owing to a false reading of the unpointed text, in old Hebrew <span class="accented">kaph</span> and <span class="accented">resh</span> being easily confounded, and <span class="accented">vau</span> and <span class="accented">pe</span>. Theodotion considered the word a common noun, translating it by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. It is probably a mere coincidence that in some Assyrian inscriptions the name <span class="accented">Kairan</span> occurs as that of a deity, who is identified with Saturn; that the Egyptians (from whom the Israelites must have derived the notion) ever acknowledged such a deity is quite unproved. St. Stephen merely quotes the <span class="accented">Textus Receptus</span> of his day, which was close enough to the original for his argument. <span class="cmt_word">The star of your god.</span> These words are in loose apposition with the preceding, and are equivalent to "your star god," or the star whom ye worship as god. Whether some particular star is meant, or whether the sun is the deity signified, cannot be determined, although the universal prevalence of the worship of sun gods in Egypt makes the latter supposition very probable.  St. Stephen puts the sin in a general form: "God gave them up to serve the host of heaven" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which ye made to yourselves.</span> This was the crime, self-will, desertion of the appointed way for devices of their own invention.
