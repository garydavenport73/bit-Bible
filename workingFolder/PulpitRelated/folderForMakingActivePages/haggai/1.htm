He is called in the inscriptions <span class="accented">Daryavush</span>, which name means "Holder," or "Supporter." Herodotus (6:98) explains it as "Coercer" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). Hitherto the prophets have dated the time of the exercise of their office from the reigns of the legitimate Hebrew monarchs; it shows a new slate of things when they place at the head of their oracles the name of a foreign and a heathen patenlate. The Jews had, indeed, now no king of their own, "the tabernacle of David had fallen" (<a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>), and they were living on sufferance under an alien power. They had returned from exile by permission of Cyrus in the first year of his occupancy of the throne of Babylon sixteen years before this time, and had commenced to build the temple soon after; but the opposition of neighbours, contradictory orders from the Persian court, and their own lukewarmness had contributed to hinder the work, and it soon wholly ceased, and remained suspended to the moment when Haggai, as the seventy years of desolation drew to an end, was commissioned to arouse them from their apathy, and to urge them to use the opportunity which was afforded by the accession of the new monarch and the withdrawal of the vexatious interdict that had checked their operations in the previous reign (see Introduction, &sect; 1; and comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/4-24.htm">Ezra 4:24</a>). The sixth month, according to the sacred Hebrew calendar, which reckoned from Nisan to Nisan. This would be Elul, answering to parts of our August and September. <span class="cmt_word">In the first day.</span> This was the regular festival of the new moon (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>), and a fitting time to urge the building of the temple, without which it could not be duly celebrated. <span class="cmt_word">By</span>; literally, <span class="accented">by the hand</span> (as in ver. 3), the instrument whom God used (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-35.htm">Exodus 9:35</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-35.htm">Acts 7:35</a>) <span class="cmt_word">Haggai the prophet</span> (see the Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>, "Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel." The temporal head of the nation, the representative of the royal house of David, and therefore with the high priest jointly responsible, for the present state of affairs, and having power and authority to amend it. The name, as explained, and rightly, by St. Jerome, means, "Born in Babylon," and intimates the truth concerning his origin. He is called Sheshbazzar in <a href="../../par/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>, which is either his name at the Persian court, or is an erroneous transliteration for a synonymous word (see Kuabenbauer, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The name is found in the cuneiform inscription, as <span class="accented">Zir-Babilu.</span> Shealtiel (or Salathiel) means, "Asked of God." There is a difficulty about Zerubbabel's parentage. Here and frequently in this book, and in Ezra and Nehemiah, as well as in <a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, he is called "son of Shealtiel;" in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a> he is said to be the son of Pedaiah the brother of Salathiel. The truth probably is that he was by birth the son of Pedaiah, but by adoption or the law of the <span class="accented">levirate</span>, the son of Salathiel. He was regarded as the grandson of Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah. <span class="cmt_word">Governor</span> (<span class="accented">pechah</span>). A foreign word, used in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>, in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>) and  frequently in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, to denote an inferior satrap or subordinate governor. Strassmaier (<span class="accented">ap.</span> Knabenbauer) notes that in Assyrian the word is found in the form <span class="accented">pachu</span>, that <span class="accented">pichatu</span> means "a province," <span class="accented">pachat</span>, "a district." It seems natural, though probably erroneous, to connect it with the Turkish pashah. But see the discussion on the word in Pusey, 'Daniel the Prophet,' p. 566, etc. Instead of "Governor of Judah," the LXX. here and ver. 12 and <a href="../../par/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2</a> reads, "of the tribe of Judah." One of the house of David has the government, but the foreign title applied to him shows that he holds authority only as the deputy of an alien power. Judah was henceforward applied to the whole country. The prophecy in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> still held good. <span class="cmt_word">Joshua</span>. The highest spiritual officer (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>). This Joshua, Jehoshua, Jeshua, as he is variously called, was a son of Josedech who, in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, had been carried captive to Babylon (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a>), and grandson of that Seraiah who, with other princes of Judah, was slain at Riblah by the Babyloniaes (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, etc.). The parentage of Zerubbabel and Joshua is specially mentioned to show that the former was of the house of David and the latter of the family of Aaron, and that even in its depressed condition Israel retained its rightful constitution (see note on Zechariah 3:1).

Trochon justly remarks that this expression is not found in the earlier books of the Bible - the Pentateuch, Joshua, and Judges. If these books were contemporary with the prophets, the phrase would certainly occur in them (see a valuable note in the Appendix to Archdeacon Perowne's Commentary on Haggai, in 'The Canibridge Bible for Schools'). <span class="cmt_word">This people;</span> <span class="accented">populus iste</span> (Vulgate), with some contempt, as if they were no longer worthy to be called the Lord's people (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-14.htm">Haggai 2:14</a>).

The excuse for their inaction may have had various grounds. They may have said, reckoning from the final destruction of Jerusalem ( <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>), that the seventy years' captivity was not complete; that there was still danger from the neighbouring population; that the Persians were adverse to the undertaking; that the unfruitful season rendered them unable to engage in such a great work; and that the very fact of these difficulties existing showed that God did not favour the design.

The temple mount is certainly not meant, as if they were to bring wood from it. Nor can Lebanon be intended, as in <a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>; for the injunction looks to an immediate actual result, and in their depressed circumstances they were scarcely likely to interest the Sidonians and Tyrians to provide cedar for them. There was abundance of wood close at hand, and the "kings forest" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>) was in the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem. There is no mention of stone, probably because the foundations had long been laid, and the ruins of the old temple supplied material for the new one; and, indeed, stone was to be had in abundance everywhere; or it may be that the prophet names merely one opening for their renewed activity, as a specimen of the work required from them.

A brief message comprised in two words, "I with you," yet full of comfort, promising God's presence, protection, aid, and blessing (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month.</span> The first admonition had been made on the first day of this month; the three intervening weeks had doubtless been spent in planning and preparing materials, and obtaining workmen from the neighbouring villages. The note of time is introduced to show how prompt was their obedience, and the exact time when "they came and did work in the house of the Lord" (ver. 14). Some, on insufficient grounds, consider this clause to be an interpolation from <a href="../../par/haggai/2-10.htm">Haggai 2:10, 18</a>, with a change of "ninth" to "sixth month." In the Latin Vulgate, in Tischendorf's Septuagint, and in many editions of the Hebrew Bible, the whole of this verse is wrongly annexed to the following chapter. St. Jerome arranges it as in the Authorized Version. It is possible that, as St. Cyril takes it, the words, <span class="cmt_word">in the second year of Darius the king,</span> ought to begin ch. 2. The king's reign has been already notified in ver. 1, and it seems natural to affix the date at the commencement of the second address. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zephaniah/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zephaniah 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zephaniah 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../haggai/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Haggai 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Haggai 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
