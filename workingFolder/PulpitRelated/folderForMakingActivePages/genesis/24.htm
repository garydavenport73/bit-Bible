<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham said auto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to his servant, the old man</span>, ancient or elder, <span class="accented">of his house, the ruler over all which</span> (sc. belonged) <span class="accented">to him</span>. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (an old man) is in most languages employed as a title of honor, - cf. <span class="accented">sheikh, senatus</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">presbyter</span>, signor, seigneur, senor, sir (Gesenius, p. 252), - and is probably to be so understood here. Eliezer of Damascus, upwards of half a century previous regarded as heir presumptive to Abraham's house (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), is commonly considered the official meant, though the point is of no importance - <span class="cmt_word">Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make thee swear.</span> This ancient form of adjuration, which is mentioned again only in chap. 47:29, and to which nothing analogous can elsewhere be discovered, - the practice alleged to exist among the modern Egyptian Bedouins of placing the hand upon the <span class="accented">membrum virile</span> in solemn forms of asseveration not forming an exact parallel, was probably originated by the patriarch. The thigh, as the source of posterity (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>), has been regarded as pointing to Abraham's future descendants (Keil, Kalisch, Lange), and in particular to Christ, the promised seed (Theodoret, Jerome, Augustine, Luther, Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth), and the oath to be equivalent to a swearing by him that was to come. By others the thigh has been viewed as euphemistically put for the generative organ, upon which the sign of circumcision was placed, and the oath as an adjuration by the sign of the covenant (Jonathan, Jarchi, Tuch). A third interpretation considers the thigh as symbolizing lordship or authority, and the placing of the hand under it as tantamount to an oath of fealty and allegiance to a superior (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Calvin, Murphy). Other explanations are modifications of the above. <span class="cmt_word">By the Lord</span> (<span class="accented">Jehovah</span>; since the marriage to which this solemn adjuration was preliminary was not an ordinary alliance, such as might have taken place under the providence of Elohim, but the wedding of the heir of the promise), <span class="cmt_word">the God of heaven, and the God of the earth</span> (a clause defining Jehovah as the supreme Lord of the universe, and therefore as the sole Arbiter of human destiny), <span class="cmt_word">that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son</span> - not investing him with authority to provide a wife for Isaac in the event of death carrying him (Abraham) off before his son's marriage, but simply explaining the negative side of the commission with which he was about to be entrusted. If it evinced Isaac's gentle disposition and submissive piety, that though forty years of age he neither thought of marriage, but mourned in devout contemplation for his mother (,Lange), nor offered resistance to his father s proposal, but suffered himself to be governed by a servant (Calvin), it was also quite in accordance with ancient practice that parents should dispose of their children in marriage (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.</span> Being prompted to this partly by that jealousy with which all pastoral tribes of Shemitie origin have been accustomed to guard the purity of their race by intermarriage (Dykes; cf. Thomson, 'Land and Book,' p. 591), and partly no doubt by his perception of the growing licentiousness of the Canaanites, as well as his knowledge of their predicted doom, though chiefly, it is probable, by a desire to preserve the purity of the promised seed. Intermarriage with the Canaanites was afterwards forbidden by the Mosaic legislation (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (literally, for, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former thing must not be done because this must be done) <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt go unto my country</span> (not Ur of the Chaldees, but the region beyond the Euphrates generally), <span class="cmt_word">and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</span> Though enforced by religious considerations, this injunction to bring none but a relative for Isaac's bride "was in no sense a departure from established usages and social laws in regard to marriage" ('Land and Book,' p. 591).
