The act here mentioned is recorded not to indicate that paradise was "non nuptiis, sed virginitate destinatum" (Jerome), but to show that while Adam was formed from the soil, and Eve from a rib taken from his side, the other members of the race were to be produced "neque ex terra neque quovis alio mode, sed ex conjunctione maris et foeminse" (Rungius). <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived</span>. The Divine blessing (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), which in its operation had been suspended during the period of innocence, while yet it was undetermined whether the race should develop as a holy or a fallen seed, now begins to take effect (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bare Cain</span>. <span class="accented">Acquisition</span> or <span class="accented">Possession</span>, <span class="accented">from kanah</span>, to acquire (Gesenius).

Kalisch, connecting it with <span class="accented">kun</span> or <span class="accented">kin</span>, to strike, sees an allusion to his character and subsequent history as a murderer, and supposes it was not given to him at birth, but at a later period. Tayler Lewis falls back upon the primitive idea of the root, to create, to procreate, generate, of which he cites as examples <a href="../../par/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, and takes the derivative to signify the <span class="accented">seed</span>, explaining Eve's exclamation <span class="accented">kanithi kain as</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">genui genitum</span> or <span class="accented">generationem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And said, I have gotten a man from the Lord</span>. The popular interpretation, regarding <span class="accented">kani-thi</span> as the emphatic word in the sentence, understands Eve to say that her child was a thing achieved, an acquisition gained, either from the Lord (Onkelos, Calvin) or by means of, with the help of, the Lord (LXX., Vulgate, Jerome, Dathe, Keil), or for the Lord (Syriac). If, however, the emphatic term is Jehovah, then <span class="accented">eth</span> with Makkeph following will be the sign of the accusative, and the sense will be, "I have gotten a man - Jehovah" (Jonathon, Luther, Baumgarten, Lewis); to which, perhaps, the chief objections are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it appears to anticipate the development of the Messianic idea, and credits Eve with too mature Christological conceptions (Lange), though if Enoch in the seventh generation recognized Jehovah as the coming One, why might not Eve have done so in the first? (Bonar), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that if the thoughts of Eve had been running so closely on the identity of the coming Deliverer with Jehovah, the child would have been called Jehovah, or at least some compound of Jehovah, such as Ishiah - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> - or Coniah - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> (Murphy); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> si scivit Messiam esse debet Jovam, quomodo existimare potuit Cainam ease Messiam, quem sciebat esse ab Adamo genitum? (Dathe); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that, while it might not be difficult to account for the mistake of a joyful mother in supposing that the fruit of her womb was the promised seed, though, "if she did believe so, it is a caution to interpreters of prophecy" (Inglis), it is not so easy to explain her belief that the promised seed was to be Jehovah, since no such announcement was made in the Prot-evangel. But whichever view be adopted of the construction of the language, it is obvious that Eve's utterance was the dictate of faith. In Cain's birth she recognized the earnest and guarantee of the promised seed, and in token of her faith gave her child a name (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/3-20.htm">Genesis 3:20</a>), which may also explain her use of the Divine name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> instead of <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, which she employed when conversing with the serpent. That Eve denominates her infant a man has been thought to indicate that she had previously borne daughters who had grown to womanhood, and that she expected her young and tender babe to reach maturity. Murphy thinks this opinion probable; but the impression conveyed, by the narrative is that Cain was the first-born of the human family. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And she again bare his brother Abel.

Perhaps also, though unconsciously, a melancholy prophecy of his premature removal by the hand of fratricidal rage, to which it has been thought there is an outlook by the historian In the frequent (seven times repeated) and almost pathetic mention of the fact that Abel was Cain s brother. The absence of the usual expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, as well as the peculiar phraseology <span class="accented">et addidit parere</span> has suggested that Abel was Cain's twin brother (Calvin, Kimchi, Candlish), though this is not necessarily implied in the text. <span class="cmt_word">And Abel was a keeper of sheep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; the latter term includes goats - <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>), <span class="cmt_word">but Cain was a tiller of the ground</span>. These occupations, indirectly suggested by God in the command to till the ground and the gift of the clothes of skin (Keil), were doubtless both practiced by the first man, who would teach them to his sons. It is neither justifiable nor necessary to trace a difference of moral character in the different callings which the young men selected, though probably their choices were determined by their talents and their tastes. Ainsworth sees in Abel a figure of Christ "in shepherd as in sacrificing and martyrdom."

All tree fruits and garden produce were excluded; it was limited to the productions of agriculture and vine growing (cf. Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship,' 140). Here it includes both meat offerings and animal sacrifices (cf. ver. 4). Unto the Lord.

"The sacrifice was accepted for the man, and not the man for the sacrifice" (Ainsworth); but still "without a doubt the words of Moses imply that the matter of Abel's offering was more excellent and suitable than that of Cain's," and one can hardly entertain a doubt that this was the idea of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews" (Prof. Lindsay, 'Lectures on Hebrews,' Edin. 1867). Abel's sacrifice was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, fuller than Cain's; it had more in it; it had faith, which was wanting in the other. It was also offered in obedience to Divine prescription. The universal prevalence of sacrifice rather points to Divine prescription than to man's invention as its proper source. Had Divine worship been of purely human origin, it is almost certain that greater diversity would have prevailed in its forms. Besides, the fact that the mode of worship was not left to human ingenuity under the law, and that will-worship is specifically condemned under the Christian dispensation (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>), favors the presumption that it was Divinely appointed from the first. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect</span>. Because of the absence of those qualities which distinguished Abel and his offering; not because the heart of Cain was "no more pure," but "imbued with a criminal propensity" (Kalisch), which it was not until his offering was rejected. The visible sign, whatever it was, being awanting in the case of Cain's oblation, its absence left the offerer in no dubiety as to the Divine displeasure with both himself and his offering. In the rejection of Cain's offering Bohlen sees the animus of a Levitical narrator, who looks down slightingly on offerings of the fruits and flowers of earth; but, as Havernick well remarks, the theocracy was essentially based on agriculture, while the Mosaic institute distinctly recognized the legality and value of bloodless offerings. <span class="cmt_word">And Cain was very wroth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">it</span> <span class="accented">burned with Cain exceedingly</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and his countenance fell</span>. In fierce resentment against his brother, possibly in disappointed rage against himself, almost certainly in anger against God (cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-16.htm">Nehemiah 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>, and contrast <a href="../../par/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>). There was apparently no sorrow for sin, "no spirit of inquiry, self-examination, prayer to God for light or pardon, clearly showing that Cain was far from a right state of mind" (Murphy). Yet the Lord does not forthwith abandon the contumacious and insensate transgressor, but patiently expostulates with and instructs him as to how he too might obtain the same blessing of acceptance which his younger brother enjoyed.

The Samaritan and Syriac versions interpolate to the same effect. The Jerusalem Targum explains - "Cainum cure Abele contendisse de vita aetcrna, de extremo judicio, et providentia divina," inserting a long conversation commencing, "Veni, egrediamur ad superficiem agri;" but the obvious supplement is to be found in the subject matter of the previous verse (Hieronynms, Aben Ezra, Gesenius). It is not against this that it argues too much moral goodness in Cain to suppose that he would tell his younger brother of Jehovah's admonition (Knobel); and it certainly relieves us from the necessity of adding to the moral turpitude of the unhappy fratricide by depicting him as deliberately planning his favored brother's murder, carrying the fell purpose within his guilty bosom, watching his opportunity (Bottcher and Knobel, who substitute <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> he <span class="accented">watched</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">he said</span>), and at last accomplishing his unhallowed purpose by means of treachery. Beyond all question the historian designs to describe not an act of culpable homicide, but a deed of red-handed murder; yet the impression which his language conveys is that of a crime rather suddenly conceived and hurriedly performed than deliberately planned and treacherously executed. <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span>

If we may not conclude that Cain was thereby for ever excluded from the hope of salvation if he should repent, still less must we explain the Divine judgment down to a simple sentence of banishment from Eden. The fratricide was henceforth to bear the displeasure and indignation of his Maker, whose image in Abel he had slain; of which indignation and displeasure his expatriation was to be a symbol. Different explanations have been offered of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">from the earth</span>, or <span class="accented">ground</span>, <span class="accented">Ad-</span>hamah, which, however, cannot mean <span class="accented">more than the ground</span>, which already had been cursed (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; Lunge), since "the curse of the soil and the misery of man cannot well be compared with each other" (Kalisch); or simply <span class="accented">away from the district</span>, the scene of his crime (Kalisch, Speaker's, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Tuch, Gerlach, Delitzsch), as if all that the sentence implied was banishment from Eden; but must involve in addition the idea that the curse was to leap upon him <span class="accented">from the earth</span>, or ground, in general (Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Knobel, Alford, Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">Which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand</span>.

The ban of wandering, which David pronounced upon his enemies (<a href="../../par/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>), in later years fell upon the Jews, who "for shedding the blood of Christ, the most innocent Lamb of God, are vagabonds to this day over the face of the earth" (Willet). Thus the earth was made the minister of God's curse, not a partaker of it, as some have strangely imagined, as if by drinking up the blood of Abel it had become a participant of Cain's crime (Delitzsch).

Or, than can be borne away. Interpreted in either way, this is scarcely the language of confession, "sufficiens confessio, sod intempestiva" (Chrysostom); but, as the majority of interpreters are agreed, of desperation (Calvin). According to the first rendering Cain is understood as deploring not the enormity of his sin, but the severity of his punishment, under which he reels and staggers as one amazed (Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Calvin, Keil, Delitzsch, Murphy, Alford, Speakers, Kalisch). According to the second, from the terrific nature of the blow which had descended on him Cain awakens to the conviction that his sin was too heinous to be forgiven (margin, Septuagint, Vulgate, Theodotion, Arabic, Syrlac, Onkelos, Samaritan, Gesenins, Wordsworth). The first of these is favored by the remaining portion of his address, which shows that that which had paralyzed his guilty spirit was not the wickedness of his deed, but the overwhelming retribution which had leapt so unexpectedly from its bosom. The real cause of his despair was the sentence which had gone forth against him, and the articles of which he now recapitulates. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou hast driven me this day</span> - "Out of the sentence of his own conscience Cain makes a clear, positive, Divine decree of banishment" (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">from the face of the earth</span>.

Amongst the Gauls the excommunicated were deprived of any benefit of law (Caesar. 'de Bello Gallico,' 50:6; cf. also Sophocles, '(Edip. Tyrannus')" (Ainsworth). The apprehension which Cain cherished has been explained as an oversight on the part of the narrator (Schumann and Tuch); as a mistake on the part of Cain, who had no reason to know that the world was not populated (T. Lewis); as referring to the blood avengers of the future who might arise from his father's family (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch); and also, and perhaps with as much probability, as indicating that already, in the 130 years that had gone, Adam's descendants were not limited to the two brothers and their wives (Havernick).

In the case of Cain's murderer there was to be no such mitigation of the penalty as in the case of Cain himself; on the contrary, he would be visited more severely than Cain, as being guilty not alone of homicide, but of transgressing the Divine commandment which said that Cain was to live (Willet). As to why this special privilege was granted to Cain, it was not because "<span class="accented">the</span> early death of the pious Abel was in reality no punishment, but the highest boon (Kalisch), nor because banishment from God s presence was the greatest possible punishment, "having in itself the significance of a social human death" (Lange), nor because it was needful to spare life for the increase of posterity (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but perhaps  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To show that "<span class="accented">Vengeance</span> is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To prove the riches of the Divine clemency to sinful men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To serve as a warning against the crime of murder.

In support of the former it is urged that an external badge would be more likely to repel assailants; while in favor of the latter it is pleaded that of seventy-six times in which <span class="accented">oth</span> occurs in the Old Testament, in seventy-five it is translated <span class="accented">sign</span>. If there was a visible mark upon the fugitive, it is impossible to say what it was; that it was a shaking (LXX.), or a continual fleeing from place to place (Lyra), or a horn in the head (Rabbis), a peculiar kind of dress (Clericus), are mere conceits. But, whatever it was, it was not a sign of Cain's forgiveness (Josephus), only a pledge of God's protection; Cf. the Divine prophetic sentence against the Jewish Cain (<a href="../../par/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>).

The geographical situation of Nod (Knobel, China?) cannot be determined further than that it was <span class="cmt_word">on the east of Eden</span>, and its name, Nod, or wandering (cf. vers. 12, 14; <a href="../../par/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>), was clearly derived from Cain s fugitive and vagabond life (<span class="accented">vide</span> Michaelis, 'Suppl,' p. 1612; and cf.

Though afterwards forbidden, the tendency of Divine legislation on the subject of marriage being always in the direction of enlarging rather than restricting the circle of prohibited relationships, the union of brothers and sisters at the first was clearly indispensable, if the race was to multiply outwards from a common stock. "Even in much later times, and among very civilized nations, such alliances were not considered incestuous. The Athenian law made it compulsory to marry the sister if she had not found a husband at a certain age. Abraham married his half-sister, Sarah; and the legislator Moses himself was the offspring of-a matrimony which he later interdicted as unholy" (Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived</span>. For even from the unbelieving and unthankful, the disobedient and the repro. bate, God's providential mercies are not entirely withheld (<a href="../../par/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bare Enoch.</span> <span class="accented">Chanoch</span>, "dedicated," "initiated," from <span class="accented">chanach</span>, to instruct (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>) and to consecrate (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>). Candlish detects in the name the impious pride of the first murderer; with more charity, Keil and Kalisch see a promise of the renovation of his life. The latter thinks that Cain called his son "Initiated" or "Instructed" to intimate that he intended to instruct him from his early years in the duties of virtue, and his city "<span class="accented">Dedicated"</span> to signify that he now recognized that "the firstling of his social prosperity belongs to God." If Luther's conjecture be correct, that the child received its name from its mother, it will touchingly express that young mother's hope that the child whom God had sent might be an augury of blessing for their saddened home, and her resolution both to consecrate him from his youth to God and to instruct him in God's fear and worship. <span class="cmt_word">And he builded</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">was</span> <span class="accented">building</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> began to build, "but never finished, leading still a runagate life, and so often constrained to leave the work, as the giants did who built the tower of Babel" (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">A city</span>. Vater, Hartmann, and Bohlen discover in the city-building of Cain "a main proof of the mythical contents of the narrative," an advanced state of civilization "utterly unsuitable to so early a period;" but ancient tradition (Phoenician, Egyptian, and Hellenic) is unanimous in ascribing to the first men the invention of agriculture and the arts, with the discovery of metals, the origin of music, &c. (vide Havernick's 'Intro.,' &sect; 16). Of course the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> which Cain erected was not a city according to modern ideas, but a keep or fort, enclosed with a wall for the defense of those who dwelt within (Murphy). It was the first step in the direction of civilization, and Kalisch notes it as a deep trait in the Biblical account that the origin of cities is ascribed not to the nomad, but to the agriculturist. Impelled by the necessities of his occupation to have a fixed residence, he would likewise in course of time be constrained by the multiplication of his household to insure their protection and comfort. It is possible also that his attempt to found a city may have been dictated by a desire to bid defiance to the curse which doomed him to a wandering life; to create for his family and himself a new point of interest outside the holy circle of Eden, and to find an outlet for those energies and powers of which, as an early progenitor of the race, he must have been conscious, and in the restless activity of which oblivion for his misery could alone be found.

Considering. the general significance of names, we shall scarcely go astray if with Kalisch we find in the name of the sister of Tubal-cain, "the beautiful," as compared with that of Adam's wife, "the living," a growing symptom of the degeneracy of the times. Beauty, rather than helpfulness, was now become the chief attraction in woman. Men selected wives for their lovely forms and faces rather than for their loving and pious hearts. The reason for the introduction of Naamah s name into the narrative commentators generally are at a loss to discover. Ingiis with much ingenuity connects it with the tragedy which some see in the lines that follow.

The words have an archaic simplicity which bespeak a high antiquity (<span class="accented">vide</span> Havernick's 'Introd.,' p. 105), naturally fall into that peculiar form of parallelism which is a well-known characteristic of Hebrew poetry, and on this account, as well as from the subject, have been aptly denominated <span class="accented">The Song of the Sword</span> (Ewald, p. 267). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Adah and gillah, Hear my voice;<br />Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech:<br />For I have slain a mum to my wounding (for my wound),<br />And a young man to my hurt (because of my strife).<br />If (for) Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,<br />Truly (and) Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</span> Origen wrote two whole books of his commentary on Genesis on this song, and at last pronounced it inexplicable.

Considering the character of the speaker and the spirit of the times, it is probable that this is the correct interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A third interpretation proposes to understand the words of Lamech hypothetically, as thus: - "If I should slay a man, then," &c.
