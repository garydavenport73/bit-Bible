The original relationship which God had established between man and the lower creatures having been disturbed by sin, the inferior animals, as it were, gradually broke loose from their condition of subjection. As corruption deepened in the human race it was only natural to anticipate that man's lordship over the animal creation would become feebler and feebler. Nor, perhaps, is it an altogether violent hypothesis that, had the Deluge not intervened, in the course of time the beast would have become the master and man the slave. To prevent any such apprehensions in the future, as there was to be no second deluge, the relations of man and the lower creatures were to be placed on a new footing. Ultimately, in the palingenesia, they would be completely restored (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>); in the mean time, till that glorious consummation should arrive, the otherwise inevitable encroachments of the creatures upon the human family in its sin-created weakness should be restrained by a principle of fear. That was the first important modification made upon the original Adamic blessing.

The relation of this verse to the former has been understood as signifying - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That animal food was expressly prohibited before the Flood, and now for the first time permitted (Mercerus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Candlish, Clarke, Murphy, Jamieson, Wordsworth, Kalisch) - the ground being that such appears the obvious import of the sacred writer s language. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That, though permitted from the first, it was not used till postdiluvian times, when men were explicitly directed to partake of it by God (Theodoret, Chrysostom, Aquinas, Luther, Pererius) - the reason being that prior to the Flood the fruits of the earth were more nutritious and better adapted for the sustenance of man's physical frame, propter excellentem terrae bonitatem praestantemque vim alimenti quod fructus terrae suppeditabant homini, while after it such a change passed upon the vegetable productions of the ground as to render them less capable of supporting the growing feebleness of the body, invalidam ad bene alendum hominem (Petetins). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That whether permitted or not prior to the Flood, it was used, and is here for the first time formally allowed (Keil, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary'); in support of which opinion it may be urged that the general tendency of subsequent Divine legislation, until the fullness of the times, was ever in the direction of concession to the infirmities or necessities of human nature (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>). The opinion, however, which appears to be the best supported is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That animal food was permitted before the fall, and that the grant is h ere expressly renewed (Justin Martyr, Calvin, Willet, Bush, Macdonald, Lange, Quarry).

The idea of the unity of the soul and the blood, on which the prohibition of blood is based, comes to light everywhere in Scripture. In the blood of one mortally wounded his soul flows forth (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>), and he who voluntarily sacrifices himself pours out his soul unto death (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). The murderer of the innocent slays the soul of the blood of the innocent (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a>), which also cleaves to his (the murderer's) skirts (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17</a>, blood of a soul; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a> with <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> with <a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> also <a href="../../par/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>). Nor can it be said to be exclusively peculiar to Holy Scripture. In ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics the hawk, which feeds on bloods, represents the soul. Virgil says of a dying person, "purpuream vomit ille animam" ('AEneid,' 9:349). The Greek philosophers taught that the blood was either the soul (Critias), or the soul s food (Pythagoras), or the soul's seat (Empedocles), or the soul's producing cause (the Stoics); but only Scripture reveals the true relation between them both when it declares the blood to be not the soul absolutely, but the means of its self-attestation (vide Delitzsch s ' Bib. Psychology,' div. 4. sec. 11.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye not eat.</span> Not referring to, although certainly forbidding, the eating of flesh taken from a living animal (Raschi, Cajetan, Delitzsch, Luther, Peele, Jamieson) - a fiendish custom which may have been practiced among the antediluvians, as, according to travelers, it is, or was, among modern Abyssinians; rather interdicting the flesh of slaughtered  animals from which the blood has not been properly drained (Calvin, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Wordsworth). The same prohibition (commonly regarded by the Hebrew doctors as the seventh of the Noachic precepts which were enjoined upon all nations; <span class="accented">vide infra</span>, ver. 6) was afterwards incorporated in the Mosaic legislation (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16, 23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>), and subsequently imposed upon the Gentile converts in the Christian Church by the authority of the Holy Ghost and the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28, 29</a>). Among other reasons, doubtless, for the original promulgation of this law were these: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A desire to guard against the practice of cruelty to animals (Chrysostom, Calvin, 'Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A design to hedge about human life by showing the inviolability which in God s eye attached to even the lives of the lower creatures (Calvin, Willet, Peele, Kalisch, Murphy). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The intimate connection which even in the animal creation subsisted between the blood and the life (Kurtz, 'Sacr. Worship,' I. A.V.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Its symbolic use as an atonement for sin (Peele, Delitzsch, ' Bib. Psy.' 4:11; Keil, Wordsworth, Murphy).

If this practice appears absurd to some moderns (Dr. H. Oort, 'The Bible for Young People,' p. 103), it was not so to Solon and Draco, in whose enactments there was a similar provision (Delitzsch, Lunge). <span class="cmt_word">And at</span> (from) <span class="cmt_word">the hand of man</span>; <span class="cmt_word">at</span> (or <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the hand of every man's brother</span>.

That the entire brute creation was designed to be embraced in the Noachic covenant seems apparent from the use of the prepositions -  <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> describing the classes to which the animals belong, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21</a>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> indicating one portion of the whole, the to <span class="accented">minus aquo</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> <span class="accented">the terminus ad quem -</span> in their enumeration (vide Furst, 'Hebrew Lex.,' sub <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>., p. 715; cf.

Literally, <span class="accented">I have given, or placed</span>, an indication that the atmospheric phenomenon referred to had already frequently appeared (Syriac, Arabic, Aben Ezra, Chrysostom, Calvin, Willet, Murphy, Wordsworth, Kalisch, Lange). The contrary opinion has been maintained that it now for the first time appeared (Bush, Keil, Delitzsch), or at least that the historian thought so (Knobel); but unless there had been no rain, or the laws of light and the atmospheric conditions of the earth had been different from what they are at present, it must have been a frequent spectacle in the primeval heavens. <span class="cmt_word">My bow.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rainbow, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). The ordinary rainbow consists of a series of successive zones or bands of polarized light, forming little concentric circles in the sky, and having a common center almost always below the horizon, and diametrically opposite to the sun. It is produced by the refraction and reflection of the sun's light through the spherical raindrops on which the rays fall, and, accordingly, must always appear, with a greater or a lesser degree of visibility, when the two material agencies come in contact The part of the sky on which the rainbow is thrown is much more bright within than without the bow. The outer space is dark, almost black; and the inner space, on the contrary, melts into the violet almost insensibly (Nichol's 'Cyclopedia of the Sciences,' art. Rainbow). It is here styled God's bow, as being his workmanship (cf. Ecclus. 43:12), and his seal appended to his covenant (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-17.htm">Genesis 9:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the cloud</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">that which veils the heavens</span>, from a root signifying to cover (Gesenius). <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be for a token,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>   =   <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, (LXX.).

The Persians seem to have associated the rainbow with similar ideas. An old picture, mentioned by Stolberg, represents a winged boy on a rainbow with an old man kneeling in a posture, of worship. The Hindoos describe the rainbow as a warlike weapon in the hands of Indras their god, "<span class="accented">with</span> which he hurls flashing darts upon the impious giants;" but also as a symbol of peace exhibited to man "when the combat of the heavens is silenced." By the Chinese it is regarded as the harbinger of troubles and misfortunes on earth, and by the old Scandinavians as a bridge uniting earth and heaven ('Kalisch on Genesis,' pp. 223, 224). Traditional reflections of the Biblical narrative, they do not "account for the application in the Pentateuch of the rainbow to a very remarkable purpose," or "explain why the New Testament represents the rainbow as an attribute of the Divine throne," or "why angels are sent as messengers on earth" (Kalisch); but are themselves accounted for and explained by it. The institution of the rainbow as a sign clearly negatives the idea (Aquinas, Cajetan) that it was originally and naturally a sign; which, if it was, "it was a lying sign," since the Flood came notwithstanding its prognostications (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">Of a covenant</span>.

One of those pregnant Scripture sayings that have in them an almost inexhaustible fullness of meaning, which does not at first sight dis. close itself to the eye of the unreflecting reader. In so far as the Noachic covenant was simply a promise that there should be no recurrence of a flood, the covenant of eternity had a corresponding limit in its duration to the period of this present terrestrial economy.

The present section, extending to ver. 27, is usually assigned to the Jehovistic author (Tuch,Bleek, Kalisch, Colenso, Kuenen), though by Davidson it is ascribed to a so-called redactor, with the exception of the present clause, which is recognized as the Jehovist's contribution to the story. The ground of this apportionment is the introduction of the name Jehovah in ver. 26 (q.v.), and certain traces throughout the paragraph of the style of writing supposed to be peculiar to the supplementer. <span class="cmt_word">And Ham is the father of Canaan</span>. <span class="accented">Kena'an</span>, the depressed or low one; either the Lowlander or inhabitant of a tow coast country, as opposed to the loftier regions (Aram); from kana , to be low, depressed, in situation, as of land (Gesenius); or more probably the servile one in spirit (Furst, Murphy, Keil, Lange). The reason for the insertion of this notice here, and of the similar one in ver. 22, was obviously to draw attention to the circumstance, not "that the origin of Israel's ascendancy and of Canaan's degradation dates so far back as the family of the second founder of the human race," as if the writer's standpoint were long subsequent to the conquest (Kalisch), but that, "as Israel was now going to possess the land of Canaan, they might know that now was the time when the curse of Canaan and his posterity should take place" (Wilier).

Gesenius, 'Gram.,' 142, 3; Glass, Sacrae Philologiae, lib. 3. tr. 3. can. 34). Neither interpretation presupposes that husbandry and vine cultivation were now practiced for the first time. That Armenia is a wine-growing country is testified by Xenophon ('Anab.,' 4:4, 9). That the vine was abundantly cultivated in Egypt is evident from representations on the monuments, as well as from Scriptural allusions. The Egyptians say that Osiris, the Greeks that Dionysus, the Romans that Saturn, first taught men the cultivation of the tree and the use of its fruit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a></div><div class="verse">And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he drank of the wine</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>; "perhaps so called from bubbling up and fermenting;" connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (Gesenius). Though the first mention of wine in Scripture, it is scarcely probable that the natural process of fermentation for so many centuries escaped the notice of the enterprising Cainites, or even of the Sethites; that, "though grapes had been in use before this, wine had not been extracted from them" (Murphy); or that Noah was unacquainted with the nature and effects of this intoxicating liquor (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Keil, Lunge). The article before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> indicates that the patriarch was "familiar with the use and treatment" of the grape (Kalisch); and Moses does not say this was the first occasion on which the patriarch tasted the fermented liquor (Calvin, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And was drunken</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (whence <span class="accented">shechar</span>, strong drink, <a href="../../par/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>), to drink to the full, very often signifies to make oneself drunken, or simply to be intoxicated as the result of drinking; and that which the Holy Spirit here reprobates is not the partaking of the fruit of the vine, but the drinking so as to be intoxicated thereby. Since the sin of Noah cannot be ascribed to ignorance, it is perhaps right, as well as charitable, to attribute it to ago and inadvertence. Six hundred years old at the time of the Flood, he must have been considerably beyond this when Ham saw him overtaken in his fault, since Canaan was Ham's fourth son (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>), and the first was not born till after the exit from the ark (<a href="../../par/genesis/8-18.htm">Genesis 8:18</a>).

Origen mentions a tradition that Canaan first saw the shame of Noah, and told it to his father. Wordsworth, following Chrysostom, believes Canaan may have been an accomplice. 'The Speaker's Commentary' thinks it would solve the difficulty which attaches to the cursing of Canaan.

The second curse pronounced upon a human being, the first having been on Cain (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>). Colenso notices that all the curses belong to the Jehovistic writer; but <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 49:6, 7, which Tuch and Bleek ascribed to the Elohist, though, doubtless in consequence of the "curse," by Davidson and others it is now assigned to the Jehovist.

For the formal omission of Ham many different reasons have been assigned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Because God had preserved him in the ark (Jewish commentators). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because if Ham had been mentioned all his other sons would have been implicated (Pererius, Lange). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because the sin of Ham was comparatively trifling (Bohlen). For the cursing of Canaan instead of Ham, it has been urged - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That he was Ham's youngest son, as Ham was Noah's (Hoffman and Delitzsch); surely a very insufficient reason for God cursing any one! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That he was the real perpetrator of the crime (Aben Ezra, Procopius, Poole, Jamieson, Lewis, &c.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That thereby the greatness of Ham's sin was evinced (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> That Canaan was already walking in the steps of his father's impiety (Ambrose, Mercerus, Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> That Noah foresaw that the Canaanites would abundantly deserve this visitation (Calvin, Wordsworth, Murphy, Kalisch, Lange). We incline to think the truth lies in the last three reasons. <span class="cmt_word">A servant of servants</span>. A Hebraism for the superlative degree; cf. "King of kings, "holy of holies, "the song of songs" (vide Gesenius, &sect; 119). <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "the last even among servants" (Calvin); "a servant reduced to the lowest degree of bondage and degradation" (Bush); "vilissima servituts pressus" (Sol.

But the change of name is sufficiently explained when we remember that "Jehovah, as such, never was the God of Japheth's descendants, and that the expression would have been as manifestly improper if applied to him as it is in its proper place applied to Shem" (Quarry, p. 393). <span class="cmt_word">Shall enlarge Japheth</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall enlarge or make room for the one that spreads abroad</span>; or, "may God concede an ample space to Japheth" (Gesenius). "Wide let God make it for Japheth" (Keil). "God give enlargement to Japheth" (Lange). So LXX., Vulgate, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic. The words form a paronomasia, both the verb and the noun being connected with the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to spread abroad; Hiph., to cause to lie open, hence to make room for, - and refer to the widespread diffusion and remarkable prosperity of the Japhetic nations. The familiar interpretation which renders "God will persuade Japheth, the persuadable," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> incline his heart by the gospel so that he may dwell in the tents of Shem (Junins, Vatablus, Calvin, Willet, Ainsworth), is discredited by the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the verb never means to persuade, except in a bad sense (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that in this sense it is never followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>, but always by the accusative (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub</span>. <span class="accented">nom</span>.; cf. Bush, p. 109). The fulfillment of the prophecy is apparent from the circumstance that "praeter Europam (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>  -  wide, extensive) "maximam Asiae pattern, totum demique novum orbem, veluti immensae maguitudinis auctarium, Japheto posterique ejus in perpetuam possessionem obtigisse" (Fuller, ' Sac. Miscel., lib. 2. c. 4, quoted by Glass); cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-5</a>, in which Japheth is given as the progenitor of fourteen peoples, to which are added the inhabitants of the lands washed by the sea. The expansive power of Japheth "refem not only to the territory and the multitude of the Japhethites, but also to their intellectual and active faculties. The metaphysics of the Hindoos, the philosophy of the Greeks, the military prowess of the Romans, and the modern science and civilization of the world are due to the race of Japheth" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span>  - not <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (Philo., Theodoret, Onkelos, Dathe, Baumgarten, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), which <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> substantially repeats the blessing already given to Shem, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> would introduce an allusion to the superiority of Shem's blessing in what the context requires should be an unrestricted benediction of Japheth; but <span class="accented">Japheth</span> (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, Keil, Lange, Kaliseh, Murphy, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary')  -  <span class="cmt_word">shall dwell</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, to dwell; used of God inhabiting the heavens (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>), dwelling in the bush (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>), residing, or causing his name to dwell, in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>); hence supposed to favor the idea that Elohim is the subject; but it was as Jehovah (not Elohim) that God abode between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the tents of Shem</span>. Not the tents of celebrity (Gesenius, Vater, Michaelis, De Wette, Knobel), but the tents of the Shemitic races, with allusion not to their subjugation by the Japhethites (Clericus, Von Bohlen, Bochart), which would not be in keeping with the former blessing pronounced upon them (Murphy), but to their subsequent contiguity to, and even commingling with, but especially to their participation in the religious privileges of, the Shemites (the Fathers, Targum Jonathan, Hisronymus, Calvin, Keil, Lange, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Candlish). The fulfillment of the prophecy is too obvious to call for illustration. <span class="cmt_word">And Canaan shall be his servant</span>.
