Beyond sitting on the ground and weeping in presence of (or upon the face of) the dead, no other rites are mentioned as having been observed by Abraham; though afterwards, as practiced among the Hebrews, Egyptians, and other nations of antiquity, mourning for the dead developed into an elaborate ritual, including such ceremonies as rending the garments, shaving the head, wearing sackcloth, covering the head with dust and ashes (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15, 16</a>).

Abraham's desire for a grave m which to deposit Sarah's lifeless remains was dictated by that Divinely planted and, among civilized nations, universally prevailing reverence for the body which prompts men to decently dispose of their dead by rites of honorable sepulture. The burning of corpses was a practice common to the nations of antiquity; but Tacitus notes it as characteristic of the Jews that they preferred interment to cremation ('Hist.,' 5:5). The wish to make Sarah's burying-place his own possession has been traced to the instinctive desire that most nations have evinced to lie in ground belonging to themselves (Rosenm&uuml;ller), to an intention on the part of the patriarch to give a sign of his right and title to the land of Canaan by purchasing a grave in its soil - cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a> (Bush), or simply to anxiety that his dead might not lie unburied (Calvin); but it was more probably due to his strong faith that the land would yet belong to his descendants, which naturally led him to crave a resting-place in the soil with which the hopes of both himself and people were identified (Ainsworth, Bush, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">That I may bury my dead out of my sight</span> - decay not suffering the lifeless corpse to remain a fit spectacle for grief or love to gaze on.

Literally, a <span class="accented">prince of Elohim</span>; not of Jehovah, since the speakers were heathen whose ideas of Deity did not transcend those expressed in the term Elohim. According to a familiar Hebrew idiom, the phrase might be legitimately translated as in the A.V. - cf. "mountains of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> great mountains, <a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; "cedars of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> goodly cedars, <a href="../../par/psalms/80-10.htm">Psalm 80:10</a> (Calvin, Kimchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'); but, as employed by the Hittite chieftains, it probably expressed that they regarded him as a prince or phylarch, not to whom God had given an elevated aspect (Lange), but either whom God had appointed (Gesenius), or whom God manifestly favored (Kalisch, Murphy). This estimate of Abraham strikingly contrasts with that which the patriarch had formed (Ver. 4) of himself. <span class="cmt_word">In the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead; none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</span> This remarkable offer on the part of the Hittites Thomson ('Land and Book,' p. 578) regards as having been merely compliment, which Abraham was too experienced an Oriental not to understand. But, even if dictated by true kindness and generosity, the proposal was one to which for many reasons - faith in God, love for the dead, and respect for himself being among the strongest - the patriarch could not accede. With perfect courtesy, therefore, though likewise with respectful firmness, he declines their offer.

This is the first mention of the use of the  precious metals as a medium of exchange,  though they must have been so employed at  a very early period (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">he  shall give it me for a possession of a burying-place amongst you.</span> The early Chaldaeans  were accustomed to bury their dead in  strongly-constructed brick vaults.

In the absence of such artificial receptacles for the dead, the nearest substitute the patriarch could obtain was one of those natural grottoes which the limestone hills of Canaan so readily afforded.

Ephron would make a present of cave and field to the patriarch, -  "and just so have I had a hundred houses, and fields, and horses given to me" ('Land and Book,' p. 578), - the design being either to obtain a valuable compensation in return, or to preclude any abatement in the price (Keil), though possibly the offer to sell the entire field when he might have secured a good price for the cave alone was an indication of Ephron's good intention (Lange). At least it seems questionable to conclude that Ephron's generous phrases, which have now become formal and hollow courtesies indeed, meant no more in that simpler age when the ceremonies of intercourse were newer, and more truly reflected its spirit (Dykes, 'Abraham, the Friend of God,' p. 287). <span class="cmt_word">In the presence of the ions of my people give I it thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">have I given</span>, the transaction being viewed as finished): <span class="cmt_word">bury thy dead.</span>

Monumental evidence attests that the practice of embalming the dead existed in Egypt in the reign of Amunophth I. ( <span class="date">B.C. 1500</span>), though probably originating, earlier. (Sharpe's 'Egypt, vol. 1. p. 31); and an examination of the Mugheir vaults for burying the dead shows that among the early Chaldaeans it was customary to place the corpse upon a matting of reed spread upon a brick floor, the head being pillowed on a single sun-dried brick, and the body turned on its left side, the right arm falling towards the left, and the fingers resting on the edge of a copper bowl, usually placed on the palm of the left hand (<span class="accented">vide</span> Rawlinson s 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 87) - <span class="cmt_word">in the cave of the field of Machpelah before: Mamre</span>. In which also in succession his own remains and those of Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah were deposited, Rachel alone of the great patriarchal family being absent. This last resting-place of Abraham and his sons, as of Sarah and her daughters, has been identified with <span class="accented">Ramet-el-Kalil</span>, an hour's journey to the north of Hebron (which is too distant), where the foundations of an ancient heathen temple are still pointed out as Abraham's house; but is more probably to be sought for in the Mohammedan mosque <span class="accented">Haram</span>, built of colossal blocks, and situated on the mountain slope of Hebron towards the east (Robinson, Thomson, Stanley, Tristram), which, after having been for 600 years hermetically sealed against Europeans,  - only three during that period having gained access to it in disguise, - was visited in 1862 by the Prince of Wales and party (<span class="accented">vide</span> Stanley, 'Lectures on Jewish Church,' App. 2.). <span class="cmt_word">The same is Hebron in the land of Canaan</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 2).

The palpable discrepancy between the statements of the Hebrew historian in this chapter concerning the patriarchal sepulcher and those of the Christian orator when addressing the Jewish Sanhedrim (<a href="../../par/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>) has been well characterized as <span class="accented">praegravis quaedam et perardua, et quorundam judicio inextricabilis quaestio</span> (Pererius). Of course the Gordian knot of difficulty may be very readily cut by boldly asserting that a mistake has been committed somewhere; either by Stephen, the original speaker, under the impulse of emotion confounding the two entirely different stories of Abraham's purchase of Machpelah and Jacob's buying of the field near Shechem (Beds, Clarke, Lange, Kalisch, Alford, and others); or by Luke, the first recorder of the Martyr's Apology, who wrote not the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the speech, but simply his own recollection of them (Jerome); or by some subsequent transcriber who had tampered with the original text, as, e.g., inserting <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, which Luke and Stephen both had omitted, as the nominative to <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (Beza, Calvin, Bishop Pearce). The Just of these hypotheses would not indeed be fatal to the Inspiration of the record; but the claims of either Luke or Stephen to be authoritative teachers on the subject of religion would be somewhat hard to maintain if it once were admitted that they had blundered on a plain point in their own national history. And yet it is doubtful if any of the proposed solutions of the problem is perfectly satisfactory; such as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the two purchases of Abraham and Jacob are here intentionally, for the sake of brevity, compressed into one account (Bengel, Pererius, Willet, Hughes); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Abraham bought two graves, one at Hebron of Ephron the Hittite, as recorded by Moses, and another at Shechem of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem (Words. worth); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the words "which Abraham bought for a sum of money" should be regarded as a parenthesis, and the sentence read as intimating that Jacob and the fathers were carried over into Shechem, and (afterwards) by the sons of Hamor the lather of Shechem interred in Abraham's sepulcher at Hebron (Cajetan). Obvious difficulties attach to each of them; but the facts shine out clear enough in spite of the encompassing obscurity, viz., that Abraham bought a tomb at Hebron, in which first the dust of Sarah was deposited, and to which afterwards the bodies of himself, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah were consigned, while Joseph and the twelve patriarchs, who all died in Egypt, were brought over to the promised land and buried in Jacob's field at Shechem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../genesis/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Genesis 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Genesis 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../genesis/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Genesis 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Genesis 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
