The less frequent occurrence of the Divine name in the Thol-doth of Isaac than in those of Terah has been explained by the fact that the historical matter of the later portion furnishes less occasion for its introduction than that of the earlier; and the predominance of the name <span class="accented">Elohim</span> over that of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in the second stage of the patriarchal history has been partly ascribed to the employment after Abraham's time of such like equivalent expressions as "God of Abraham" and "God of my father" (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">for his wife,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">opposite to</span> his wife, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. beside his wife, placing himself opposite her, and conjoining his supplications with hers (Ainsworth, Bush); or, better, in behalf of his wife (<span class="accented">LXX</span>., Vulgate, Calvin, Keil, Kalisch), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. setting her over against him as the sole object to which he had regard in his intercessions (Luther) - <span class="cmt_word">because she was barren</span>: - as Sarah had been before her (<span class="accented">vide</span> Genesis 11:80); the long-continued sterility of both having been designed to show partly that "children are the heritage of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>), but chiefly that the children of the promise were to be not simply the fruit of nature, but the gift of grace <span class="cmt_word">and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10</a>).
