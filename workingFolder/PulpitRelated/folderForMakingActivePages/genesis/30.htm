If not warranted to infer that Rachel s barrenness was due to lack of prayer on her part and Jacob s (Keil), we are at least justified in asserting that her conduct in breaking forth into angry reproaches against her husband was unlike that of Jacob's mother, Rebekah, who, in similar circumstances, sought relief in prayer and oracles (Kalisch). The brief period that had elapsed since Rachel's marriage, in comparison with the twenty years of Rebekah's barrenness, signally discovered Rachel's sinful impatience.

The employment of Elohim by Jacob and Rachel, supposed to mark the first thirteen verses as belonging to the primitive document (Tuch, Bleek, Kalisch), though by others (Davidson, Colenso) they are ascribed to the Jehovist, is sufficiently explained by Rachers consciousness that in a large measure her handmaid's son was rather the fruit of her own impious device than the gift of Jehovah (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore called she his name Dan</span> - i.e. "Judge," one decreeing justice, <span class="accented">vindex</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, to judge (Gesenius, Keil, Lange, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), though, as in other proper names, e.g. Joseph, Zebulun, in which two verbs are alluded to, Michaelis thinks non <span class="accented">ajudicando solum</span>, <span class="accented">sed et ab audiendo nomen accepisse Danem</span>, and connects it with another verb, a denominative from an Arabic root, signifying to hear (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Suppl.,' p. 425).

The six sons of Leah might be born in the seven years, allowing one year's complete cessation from pregnancy, viz., the fifth; Bilhah's in the third and fourth years; Zilpah's in the beginning of the sixth and seventh; and Rachel's toward the end of the seventh, leaving Dinah to be born later (cf.
