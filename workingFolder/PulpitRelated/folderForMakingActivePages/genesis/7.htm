At the end of the 120 years, when the building of the ark had been completed, and only seven days before the Flood - doubtless by an audible voice still speaking to him from between the cherubim, which we can suppose had not yet vanished from the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Come thou and all thy house into the ark</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> prepare for entering; the actual entry taking place seven days later.

"To be righteous before God," the usual Scriptural phrase for justification (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In this generation</span>. <span class="accented">Vide Genesis</span> 6:9.

That the distinction between clean and unclean animals was at this time understood is easier to believe than that the writer would perpetrate the glaring anachronism of introducing in prediluvian times what only took its rise several centuries later (Kalisch). That this distinction was founded on nature, "every tribe of mankind being able to distinguish between the sheep and the hyena, the dove and the vulture" ('Speaker's Commentary'), or "on an immediate conscious feeling of the human spirit, not yet clouded by any ungodly and unnatural culture, which leads it to see in many beasts pictures of sin and corruption" (Keil), has been supposed; but with greater probability it was of Divine institution, with reference to the necessities of sacrifice (Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>). To this was appended in the Levitical system a distinction between clean and unclean in respect of man's food (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-3.htm">Leviticus 11:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou take</span> - inconsistent with <a href="../../par/genesis/6-20.htm">Genesis 6:20</a>, which says the animals were to come to Noah (Colenso); but <a href="../../par/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>, which says that Noah was to bring them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> make them go (at least nearly equivalent to take), clearly recognizes Noah's agency (Quarry) - <span class="cmt_word">to thee by sevens.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">seven, seven</span>; either seven <span class="accented">pairs</span> (Vulgate, LXX., Aben Ezra, Clericus, Michaells, De Wette, Knobel, Kalisch, Murphy, Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary'), or seven individuals (Chrysostom, Augustine, Theodoret, Calvin, Pererius, Wiliet, Delitzsch, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Bush); both parties quoting the next clause in support of their particular interpretation. Davidson, Colenso, and Kalisch challenge both interpretations as "irreconcilable with the preceding narrative" (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>); but the obvious answer is, that while in the first communication, which was given 120 years before, when minute instructions were not required, it is simply stated that the animals should be preserved by pairs; in the second, when the ark was finished and the animals were about to be collected, it is added that, in the case of the few clean beasts used for sacrifice, an exception should be made to the general rule, and not one pair, but either three pairs with one over, or seven pairs, should be preserved. <span class="cmt_word">The male and his female</span>. This seems to be most in favor of the first interpretation, that pairs, and not individuals, are meant. <span class="cmt_word">And of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.</span> <span class="accented">Ish veishto</span>. Cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>, where the phrase denotes the ethical personality of human beings, to which there is here an approximation, as the preserved animals were designed to be the parents of subsequent races. The usual phrase for male and female, which is employed in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> (a so-called Elohistic) and <a href="../../par/genesis/7-3.htm">Genesis 7:3</a> (a so-called Jehovistic section), refers to the physical distinction of sex in human beings.

The importance assigned in subsequent Scripture to the number forty, probably from the circumstance here recorded, is too obvious to be overlooked.

The scouts remained forty days in Canaan (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>). Moses was forty days in the mount (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). Elijah fasted forty days and forty nights in the wilderness of Beersheba (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>). A respite of forty days was given to the Ninevites (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>).

The contrast between the two names of the Deity is here most vividly presented.

While, then, it is admitted that the words may depict a complete submergence of the globe, it is maintained by many competent scholars that the necessities of exegesis only demand a partial inundation (Peele, Murphy, Taylor Lewis, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis).

Literally, <span class="accented">the breath of the spirit of lives, i.e.</span> all mankind. A clear pointing backwards to <a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, which leads Davidson to ascribe vers. 22, 23 to the Jehovist, although Eichhorn, Tuch, Bleek, Vaihinger, and others leave them in the fundamental document, but which is rather to be regarded as a proof of the internal unity of the book. <span class="cmt_word">Of all that was in the dry land</span>, - a further specification of the creatures that perished in the Flood, - <span class="cmt_word">died</span>. It is obvious the construction of vers. 21, 22 may be differently understood. Each verse may be taken as a separate sentence, as in the A.V., or the second sentence may commence with the words, "And every man," as in the present exposition. Thus far the calamity is simply viewed in its objective result, In the words which follow, which wear the aspect of an unnecessary repetition, it is regarded in its relation to the Divine threatening.

The straits to which the advocates of the documentary hypothesis are sometimes reduced are remarkably exemplified by the fortunes of these verses (21-23) in the attempt to assign them to their respective authors. Astruc conjectures that ver. 21 was taken from what he calls monumentum B, ver. 22 from "monument" A, and ver. 23 from monument C. Eichhorn ascribes vers. 21, 22 to an Elohistic author, and ver. 23 to a Jehovistic. Ilgen assigns vers. 21, 22 to the first, and ver. 23 to the second Elohist. Bleek, all three to the Elohist; and Davidson ver. 21 to the Elohist, vers. 22, 23 to the Jehovist. Amid such uncertainty it will be reasonable to cling to the belief that Moses wrote all the three verses, at least till the higher criticism knows its own mind.
