The worship of sacred stones (Baetylia), afterwards prevalent among the Greeks, Romans, Hindoos, Arabs, and Germans, though by some (Kuenen, Oort; <span class="accented">vide</span> 'The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 231) regarded as one of the primeval forms of worship among the Hebrews, was expressly interdicted by the law of Moses (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-22.htm">Deuteronomy 16:22</a>). It was probably a heathen imitation of the rite here recorded, though by some authorities (Keil, Knobel, Lange) the Baetylian worship is said to have been connected chiefly with meteoric stones which were supposed to have descended from some divinity; as, e. g., the stone in Delphi sacred to Apollo; that in Emesa, on the Orontes, consecrated to the sun; the angular rock at Pessinus in Phrygia worshipped as hallowed by Cybele; the black stone in the Kaaba at Mecca believed to have been brought from heaven by the angel Gabriel (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kalisch in /Gee). That the present narrative was a late invention, "called into existence by a desire" on the part of the priests and prophets of Yahweh (Jehovah) "<span class="accented">to</span> proclaim the high antiquity of the sanctuary at Bethel, and to make a sacred stone harmless" ('The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 231), is pure assumption. The circumstance that the usage here mentioned is nowhere else in Scripture countenanced (except in <a href="../../par/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>, with reference to this same pillar) forms a sufficient pledge of the high antiquity of the narrative (<span class="accented">vied</span> Havernick's 'Introd.,' &sect; 20).

Rosenm&uuml;ller and Kalisch find a connection between Bethel and Baetylia, the former regarding Beetylia as a corruption of Bethel, and the latter viewing Bethel as the Hebraised form of Beetylion. Keil objects to both that the interchange of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x398;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span>), would be perfectly inexplicable.

From the circumstances recorded in the narrative, Jacob called the spot where he slept (in the vicinity of Luz) Bethel - the designation afterwards extending to the town (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-6.htm">Genesis 35:6</a>). Until the conquest both titles appear to have been used - Luz by the Canaanites, Bethel by the Israelites. When the conquest was completed the Hebrew name was substituted for the Hittite, the sole survivor of the captured city building another Luz in another part of the country (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/judges/1-26.htm">Judges 1:26</a>).

Accordingly, the clause is best placed in the protasis of the sentence, which then practically reads, "if Elohim will be Jehovah to me, and if Jehovah will be to me Elohim" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hengstenberg, 'Introduction,' vol. 1. p. 358).
