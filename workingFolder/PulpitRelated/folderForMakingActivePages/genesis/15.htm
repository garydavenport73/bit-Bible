That this was a personal designation of the pre-incarnate Logos, if not susceptible of complete demonstration, yet receives not a little sanction from the language employed throughout this narrative (cf. Vers. 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, &c.). At least the expression denotes "the Lord manifesting himself by speech to his servant" (Murphy; <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 1:3) - <span class="cmt_word">came</span> (literally, was) <span class="cmt_word">unto Abram in a vision</span> - a night vision, but no dream (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 5). Biblically viewed, the vision, as distinguished from the ordinary dream, defines the presentation to the bodily senses or to the mental consciousness of  objects usually beyond the sphere of their  natural activities; hence visions might be  imparted in dreams (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>), or in  trances (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Fear not, Abram.</span> With allusion, doubtless, to the patriarch's mental dejection, which was probably occasioned by the natural re action consequent upon his late high-pitched  excitement (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>), which  might lead him to anticipate either a war of  revenge from the Asiatic monarchs (Jonathan), or an assault from the heathen Canaanites, already jealous of his growing power,  or perhaps both. Wordsworth observes that the words here addressed to Abram are commonly employed in Scripture to introduce  announcements of Christ (<a href="../../par/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a>; cf.

It is not needful to suppose with Lange an actual vision of a shield and treasure.

The paronomasia of this utterance is apparent, and was obviously designed to impart a touch of pathos to the patriarch's grief by pointing out the coincidence that the <span class="accented">Ben</span>-<span class="accented">shek</span> of his house was either <span class="accented">Dammesek</span> (Damascus) in the person of Eliezer (Delitzsch, Keil), or the Damascene Eliezer (Onkelos, Syriac, Aben Ezra, Calvin, Lange, Murphy), or <span class="accented">Dammesek-Eliezer</span> as one word (Kalisch).

Rosenm&uuml;ller conceives the question put in Abram's mouth to be only a device of the narrator's to lead up to the subject following.

Cf.

Wordsworth detects in the non-dividing of the birds an emblem of "the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of peace and love; which is a Spirit of unity, and of "Christ's human spirit, which was not divisible." Kalisch, with more probability, recognizes as the reason of their not being divided the fact that such division was not required, both fowls being regarded as one part of the sacrifice only, and each, as the half, being placed opposite the other. Wordsworth numbers seven parts in the sacrifice, and sees a symbol of completeness and finality, the number seven being the root of <span class="accented">shaba</span>, to swear (Gesenius, p. 802); Kalisch reckons four, which he regards as "denoting perfection, but rather the external perfection of form than the internal one of the mind," and pointing "to the perfect possession of the Holy Land." The ritual here described is the same which was afterwards observed among the Hebrews in the formation of covenants (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/34-18.htm">Genesis 34:18</a>), and appears to have extensively prevailed among heathen nations (cf. ' Iliad,' b. 124, "<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>;" and the Latin phrase, "<span class="accented">foedus</span> icere").

The act of scaring the voracious birds has been taken to represent the ease with which Abram or Israel would ward off his enemies (Jonathan, Targums, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bush); the averting of destruction from the Israelites through Abram's merit (Kalisch, Keil); Abram's religious regard for and observance of God's treaty (Wordsworth); the patriarch's expectation that God was about to employ the sacrificial victims for some holy purpose (Alford); simply his anxiety to preserve the victims pure and un-mutilated for whatever end they might have to serve (Murphy).
