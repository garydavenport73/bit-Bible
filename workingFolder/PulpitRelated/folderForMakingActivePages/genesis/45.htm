The meaning is that the Egyptian officials of Joseph's house, who were standing outside, heard, and reported it to the house of Pharaoh (Keil, Murphy).

Hitherto he had been known to his brethren as Zaphnath-paaneah. Now the voice and the appearance of their long-lost brother would rush upon their minds at the first sound of the familiar name, and fill them with apprehension. Probably Joseph's discernment of this in their countenances was the reason why he asked so abruptly after Jacob. <span class="cmt_word">Doth my father yet live</span>? It is not now "the old man of whom ye spake" (<a href="../../par/genesis/43-27.htm">Genesis 43:27</a>) for whom Joseph inquires, but his own beloved and revered parent - "my father."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25</a></div><div class="verse">And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-28.</span> - And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, and told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he (literally, <span class="accented">and that he</span>; an emphatic assurance which Keil, following Ewald, renders by" yea," and Kalisch by "indeed") is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's (literally, <span class="accented">his, i.e.</span> Jacob's) heart fainted (literally, <span class="accented">A few chill</span>, the primary idea of the root being that of rigidity through coldness; cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, to be rigid, and <span class="accented">pigeo, rigeo, frigeo</span>, to be chill. The sense is that Jacob s heart seemed to stop with amazement at the tidings which his sons brought), for he believed them not. This was scarcely a case of believing not for joy (Bush), but rather of incredulity arising from suspicion, both of the messengers and their message, which was only removed by further explanation, and in particular by the sight of Joseph's splendid presents and commodious carriages. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about Joseph's invitation and promise (vers. 9-11) - and when he saw the wagons - probably royal vehicles (Wordsworth) - which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived (literally, <span class="accented">lived</span>; it having been previously numb and cold, as if dead): and Israel said, - the change of name here is significant. The sublime theocratic designation, which had dropped into obscurity during the period of the old man's sorrow for his lost son, revives with the resuscitation of his dead hope (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/43-6.htm">Genesis 43:6</a>) - It is enough (one word, as if expressing his complacent satisfaction); Joseph my son is yet alive (this is the one thought that fills his aged heart): I will go down - "The old man is young again in spirit; he is for going immediately; he could leap; yes, fly" (Lange) - and see him (a sight of Joseph would be ample compensation for all the years of sorrow he had passed through) before I die. He would then be ready to be gathered to his fathers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
