Though not the imaginary or mythical (Bohlen), it is doubtful if she was the real (Ainsworth, Bush), ancestor of the Hagarenes (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10, 19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-31.htm">1 Chronicles 27:31</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6, 8</a>).

Calvin notes that Sarai s desire of offspring was not prompted by natural impulse, but by the zeal of faith which made her wish to secure the promised benediction. As yet it had not been clearly intimated that Sarai was to be the mother of Abram's child; and hence her recourse to what was a prevalent practice of the times, while unjustifiable in itself, was a signal proof of her humility, of her devotion to her husband, and perhaps also of her faith in God. <span class="cmt_word">And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</span> "The faith of both was defective; not indeed with regard to the substance of the premise, but with regard to the method in which they proceeded" (Calvin).

The act of Sarai (cf. the similar behavior of Stratonice, the wife of King Deiotarus, who, according to Plutarch, gave her maid Electra to her husband, and so obtained an heir to the crown) is as little to be imitated as the conduct of Abram. The apparent repetitions in Vers. 1-3 do not require the hypothesis of different authorship (Tuch, Colenso, Bleek, Davidson) for their explanation, but are characteristic of the genius of Hebrew composition (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1-10</a>), and may even be considerably removed by connecting Vers. 1, 2 with <a href="../../par/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, and commencing the new sub-section with <a href="../../par/genesis/16-3.htm">Genesis 16:3</a> (Quarry, p. 331).

Whether Hagar imagined Sarai to be through her barrenness "tanquam <span class="accented">a Divino promisso repudiatam"</span> (Lyra), or anticipated Sarai's displacement from her position as Abram s wife (Inglis), she, immediately on perceiving her condition, became insolent (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-23.htm">Proverbs 30:23</a>).
