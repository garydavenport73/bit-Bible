Joseph, having been introduced to Pharaoh in his thirtieth year (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>), and having been thirty-nine years of age (<a href="../../par/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6</a>) when his father, aged one hundred and thirty (<a href="../../par/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>), came down to Egypt, must have been born before Jacob was ninety-one; consequently, as his birth occurred in the fourteenth year of Jacob's sojourn in Mesopotamia (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/30-25.htm">Genesis 30:25</a> with Genesis 29:18, 21, 27), Jacob's flight must have taken place when he was seventy-seven. But Jacob was born in Isaac's sixtieth year (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>); hence Isaac was now one hundred and thirty-seven. There are, however, difficulties connected with this reckoning which lay it open to suspicion. For one thing, it postpones Jacob s marriage to an extremely late period. Then it takes for granted that the term of Jacob's service in Padan-aram was only twenty years (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a>), whereas it is not certain whether it was not forty, made up, according to the computation of Kennicott, of fourteen years' service, twenty years' assistance as a neighbor, and six years of work for wages. And, lastly, it necessitates the birth of Jacob's eleven children in the short space of six years, a thing which appears to some, it not impossible, at least highly improbable. Adopting the larger number as the term of Jacob s sojourn in Mesopotamia, Isaac would at this time be only one hundred and seventeen (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Chronologer of Jacob's Life,' 31:41) - <span class="cmt_word">and his eyes were dim,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">were failing in strength</span>, hence becoming dim (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>).

The phrase, though not included in Isaac's address to Esau, need not be regarded as due to Rebekah's invention. She may have understood it to be implied in her husband's language, though it was not expressed (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>). That it was designedly omitted by Isaac in consequence of the worldly character of Esau appears as little likely as that it was deliberately inserted by Rebekah to whet her favorite's ambition (Kalisch). As to meaning, the sense may be that this patriarchal benediction was to be bestowed sincerely (Menochius), in presence and by the authority of God (Ainsworth, Bush, Clericus); but the use of the term <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> rather points to the idea that Rebekah regarded Isaac simply "as the instrument of the living and personal God, who directed the concerns of the chosen race (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">Before my death.</span> Since Rebekah makes no remark as to the groundlessness of Isaac s fear, it is not improbable that she too shared in her bed-ridden husband's expectations that already he was "in the presence of" his end.

With the Persians it was a mark of honor (Xenoph., 'Agesil.,' 5. 4). The Rabbins permitted only three kinds of kisses - the kiss of reverence, of reception, and of dismissal.

Esau was at this time a man of mature age, being either fifty-seven or seventy-seven years old, and must have been acquainted with the heavenly oracle (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) that assigned the precedence in the theocratic line to Jacob. Zither, therefore, he must have supposed that his claim to the blessing was not thereby affected, or he was guilty of conniving at Isaac's scheme for resisting the Divine will. Indignation at Jacob's duplicity and baseness, combined with sympathy for Esau in his supposed wrongs, sometimes prevents a just appreciation of the exact position occupied by the latter in this extraordinary transaction. Instead of branding Jacob as a shameless deceiver, and hurling against his fair fame the most opprobrious epithets, may it not be that, remembering the previously-expressed will of Heaven, the real supplanter was Esau, who as an accomplice of his father was seeking secretly, unlawfully, and feloniously to appropriate to himself a blessing which had already been, not obscurely, designated as Jacob's? On this hypothesis the miserable craft of Jacob and Rebekah was a lighter crime than that of Isaac and Esau.

The precise import of Esau's exclamation has been rendered, "Has he not been justly (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">juste</span>, Vulgate; rightly, A.V.) named Supplanter from supplanting?" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). "Is it because he was named Jacob that he hath now twice supplanted me?" (Ainsworth, Bush). "Has he received the name Jacob from the fact that he has twice outwitted me?" (Keil). "Shall he get the advantage of me because he was thus inadvertently named Jacob?" (Lange). "Has in truth his name been called Jacob?" (Kalisch). All agree in bringing out that Esau designed to indicate a correspondence between Jacob's name and Jacob's practice. <span class="cmt_word">He took away my birthright</span>; - this was scarcely correct, since Esau voluntarily sold it (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-33.htm">Genesis 25:33</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing</span>. Neither was this exactly accurate, since the blessing did not originally belong to Esau, however he may have imagined that it did. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</span> The question indicates that Esau had no proper conception of the spiritual character of the blessing which his brother had obtained.

In support of this latter rendering it is urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is grammatically admissible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it corresponds with the present aspect of Idumaea, which is "on the whole a dreary and unproductive land;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it agrees with the preceding statement that every blessing had already been bestowed upon Jacob; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it explains the play upon the words "fatness" and "dew," which are here chosen to describe a state of matter exactly the opposite to that which was declared to be the lot of Jacob. On the other hand, it is felt to be somewhat arbitrary to assign to the preposition a partitive sense in ver. 28 and a privative in ver. 39. Though called in later times (<a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>) a waste and desolate region, it may not have been originally so, or only in comparison with Canaan; while according to modern travelers the glens and mountain terraces of Edom, covered with rich soil, only want an industrious population to convert the entire region into "one of the wealthiest, as it is one of the most picturesque, countries in the world."

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>, used of beasts which have broken the yoke and wander freely about (Gesenius, Furst), appear to hint at an incessant restlessness on the part of Edom while under Israel's yoke which should eventually terminate in regaining their independence. The exact rendering of the clause is obscure, but perhaps means that when Edom should roam about as a freebooter (Lange), or should revolt (Alford), or should toss, shake, or struggle against the yoke (Vulgate, Keil, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary), he should succeed. Other renderings are, when thou shalt bear rule (Kimchi), when thou shalt repent (Jarchi), when thou shalt be strong (Samaritan), when thou prevailest (Murphy), when thou shalt truly desire it (Kalisch), when thou shalt pull down (LXX.); because thou art restless (Havernick). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 27:41-46

Isaac, however, lived upwards of forty years after this. <span class="cmt_word">Then will I slay my brother Jacob</span>. That which reconciled Isaac and Ishmael (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9</a>), the death of a father, is here mentioned as the event which would decisively and finally part Esau and Jacob. Esau's murderous intention Calvin regards as a clear proof of the non-reality of his repentance for his sin, the insincerity of his sorrow for his father, and the intense malignity of his hate against his brother.
