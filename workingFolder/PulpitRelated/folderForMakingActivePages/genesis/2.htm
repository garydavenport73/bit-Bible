With the creation of man upon the sixth day the Divine Artificer's labors were brought to a termination, and his work to a completion.

Not simply had Elohim paused in his activity, but the Divine idea of his universe had been realized. The finished world was a cosmos, arranged, ornamented, and filled with organized, sentient, and rational beings, with plants, animals, and man; and now the resplendent fabric shone before him a magnificent success - "lo! very good."

Others understand the sense to be <span class="accented">declared</span> the work to be finished, while Baumgarten and Delitzsch regard the resting as included in the completion of the work, and Von Bohlen thinks "the language is not quite precise."

The expression is a pure anthropomorphism. "He who fainteth not, neither is weary" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>), can be conceived of neither as resting nor as needing rest through either exhaustion or fatigue. Cessation from previous occupation is all that is implied in the figure, and is quite compatible with continuous activity in other directions. <a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a> represents the Father as working from that period onward in the preservation and redemption of that world which by his preceding labors he had created and made. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God blessed the seventh day</span>. The blessing (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22, 28</a>) of the seventh day implied - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That it was thereby declared to be the special object of the Divine favor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That it was thenceforth to be a day or epoch of blessing for his creation.

Literally, declared it holy, or set it apart for holy purposes. As afterwards Mount Sinai was sanctified (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-23.htm">Exodus 19:23</a>), or, for the time being, invested with a sacred character as the residence of God; and Aaron and his sons were sanctified, or consecrated to the priestly office (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>); and the year of Jubilee was sanctified, or devoted to the purposes of religion (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), so here was the seventh day sanctified, or instituted in the interests of holiness, and as such proclaimed to be a holy day. <span class="cmt_word">Because that in it he had</span> <span class="cmt_word">rested from all his work which God had created and made</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">created to make</span>, the exact import of which has been variously explained. The "<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX. is obviously incorrect. Calvin, Ainsworth, Bush, <span class="accented">et alii</span> take the second verb <span class="accented">emphatice</span>, as intensifying the action of the first, and conveying the idea of a perfect creation. Kalisch, Alford, and others explain the second as <span class="accented">epexegetic</span> of the first, as in the similar phrases, "spoke, saying, literally, spoke to speak" (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-10.htm">Exodus 6:10</a>), and "<span class="accented">labor</span>ed to do" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>). Onkelos, the Vulgate (<span class="accented">quod Dens creavit ut faceret</span>), Calvin, Tayler Lewis, &c. understand the infinitive in a <span class="accented">relic</span> sense, as expressive of the purpose for which the heavens and the earth were at first created, viz., that by the six days' work they might be fashioned into a cosmos. It has been observed that the usual concluding formula is not appended to the record of the seventh day, and the reason has perhaps been declared by Augustine: "Dies autem septimus sine vespera eat, nee habet occasum, quia sanctificasti eum ad permansionem sempiternam" ('Confess.,' 13:36). But now what was this seventh day which received Elohim's benediction? On the principle of interpretation applied to the creative days, this must be regarded as a period of indefinite duration, compounding to the human era of both Scripture and geology. But other Scriptures (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-12.htm">Deuteronomy 5:12</a>, &c.) show that the Hebrews were enjoined by God to observe a seventh day rest in imitation of himself. There are also indications that sabbatic observance was not unknown to the patriarchs (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27, 28</a>), to the antediluvians (<a href="../../par/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6-12</a>), and to Cain and Abel (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>). Profane history likewise vouches for the veracity of the statement of Josephus, that "there is not any city of the Grecians, nor any of the barbarians, nor any nation whatsoever, whither our custom of resting on the seventh day hath not come" ('Contra Apionem,' 2:40). The ancient Persians, Indians, and Germans esteemed the number seven as sacred. By the Greeks and Phoenicians a sacred character was ascribed to the seventh day. The Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and other nations of antiquity were acquainted with the hebdomadal division of time. Travelers have detected traces of it among the African and American aborigines. To account for its existence among nations so widely apart, both chronologically and geographically, recourse has been had to some violent hypotheses; as, e.g., to the number of the primary planets known to the ancients (Humboldt), the division of a lunar month into four nearly equal periods of seven days (Ideler, Baden Powell, &c.), Jewish example (Josephus). Its true genesis, however, must be sought for in the primitive observance of a seventh day rest in accordance with Divine appointment. Precisely as we reason that the early and widespread prevalence of sacrifice can only be explained by an authoritative revelation to the first parents of the human family of such a mode of worship, so do we conclude that a seventh day sabbath must have been prescribed to man in Eden. The question then arises, Is this sabbath also referred to in the Mosaic record of the seventh day? The popular Belief is that the institution of the weekly sabbath alone is the subject spoken of in the opening verses of the present chapter; and the language of <a href="../../par/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> may at first sight appear to warrant this conclusion. A more careful consideration of the phraseology employed by Moses, how ever, shows that in the mind of the Hebrew lawgiver there existed a distinction between God's seventh day and man's sabbath, and that, instead of identifying the two, he meant to teach that the first was the reason of the second; as thus - "In six days God made.... and rested on the seventh day; where fore God blessed the (weekly) sabbath day, and hallowed it." Here it is commonly assumed that the words are exactly parallel to those in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, and that the sabbath in Exodus corresponds to the seventh day of Genesis. But this is open to debate. The seventh day which God blessed in Eden was the first day of human life, and not the seventh day; and it is certain that God did not rest from his labors on man's seventh day, but on man's first. We feel inclined then to hold with Luther that in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> Moses says nothing about man's day, and that the seventh day which received the Divine benediction was God's own great aeonian period of sabbatic rest. At the same time, for the reasons above specified, believing that a weekly sabbath was pre scribed to man from the beginning, we have no difficulty in assenting to the words of Tayler Lewis: "'And God blessed the seventh day.' Which seventh day, the greater or the less, the Divine or the human, the aeonian or the astronomical? Both, is the easy answer; both, as commencing at the same time, so far as the one connects with astronomical time; both, as the greater including the less; both, as being (the one as represented, the other as typically representing) the same essence and idea." It does not appear necessary to refute the idea that the weekly sabbath had no existence till the giving of the law, and that it is only here proleptically referred to by Moses. In addition to the above-mentioned historical testimonies to the antiquity of the Sabbath, the Fifth Tablet in the Chaldean Creation Series, after referring to the fourth day's work, proceeds: -   <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"On the seventh day he appointed a holy day,<br />And to cease from all business he commanded.<br />Then arose the sun in the horizon of heaven in (glory)."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>thus apparently affirming that, in the opinion of the early Babylonians, the institution of the sabbath was coeval with the creation.

Misled by the LXX., who render <span class="accented">toldoth</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, Ranks, Title, Havernick, Tuch, Ewald, and Stahelin disconnect the entire verse from the second section, which says nothing about the origination of the heavens and the earth, and append it to the preceding, in which their creation is described. Ilgen improves on their suggestion by transferring it to the commencement of <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, as an appropriate superscription. Dreschler, Vaihingel Bohlen, Oehler, Macdonald, <span class="accented">et alii</span> divide the verse into two clauses, and annex the former to what precedes, commencing the ensuing narrative with the latter. All of these proposals are, however, rendered unnecessary by simply observing that <span class="accented">toldoth</span> (from <span class="accented">yaladh</span>, to bear, to beget; hence begettings, procreations, evolutions, developments) does not describe the antecedents, but the consequents, of either thing or Person (Rosen., Keil, Kalisch). <span class="accented">The toldoth</span> of Noah are not the genealogical list of the patriarch's ancestry, but the tabulated register of his posterity; and so the generations <span class="cmt_word">of the heavens and the earth</span> refer not to their original production (Gesenius), but to their onward movements from creation downwards (Keil). Hence with no incongruity, but with singular propriety, the first half of the present verse, ending with the words <span class="cmt_word">when they were created</span>, literally, <span class="accented">in tier creation</span>, stands at the commencement of the section in which the forward progression of the universe is traced. The point of departure in this subsequent evolution of the material heavens and earth is further specified as being <span class="cmt_word">in the day that the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">made the earth and the heavens</span>; not the heavens and the earth, which would have signified the universe (cf. on Genesis 1:1), and carried hack the writer s thought to the initial act of creation; but the earth and the atmospheric firmament, which indicates the period embracing the second and (possibly) the third creative days as the <span class="accented">terminus aguo</span> of the generations to be forthwith recorded. Then it was that the heavens and the earth in their development took a clear and decided step forward in the direction of man and the human family (was it in the appearance of vegetation?); and in this thought perhaps will be found the key to the significance of the new name for the Divine Being which is used exclusively throughout the present section - <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah Elohim</span>. From the frequency of its use, and the circumstance that it never has the article, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah</span> may be regarded as the proper Personal name of God. Either falsely interpreting <a href="../../par/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>, or following some ancient superstition (mysterious names of deities were used generally in the East; the Egyptian Hermes had a name which (Cic. 'de Natura Deorum,' 8, 16) durst not be uttered: Furst), the later Hebrews invested this <span class="accented">nomen</span> <span class="accented">tetra</span>. <span class="accented">grammaton</span> with such sanctity that it might not bepronounced (Philo, Vit. <span class="accented">Mosis</span>, 3:519, 529). Accordingly, it was their custom to write it in the sacred text with the vowel points of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, or, if that preceded, Elohim. Hence considerable doubt now exists as to its correct pronunciation. Etymologically viewed it is a future form of <span class="accented">havah</span>, an old form of <span class="accented">hayah</span>; uncertainty as to what future has occasioned many different suggestions as to what constituted its primitive vocalization. According to the evidence which scholars have collected, the choice lies between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jahveh (Gesenius, Ewald, Reland, Oehler, Macdonald, the Samaritan), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yehveh or Yeheveh (Furst, W. L. Alexander, in Kitto's 'Cyclopedia'), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jehovah (Michaelis, Meyer, Stier, Hoelmann, Tregelles, Murphy). Perhaps the preponderance of authority inclines to the first; but the common punctuation is not so indefensible as some writers allege. Gesenius admits that it more satisfactorily accounts for the abbreviated syllables <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> than the pronunciation which he himself favors. Murphy thinks that the substitution of Adonai for Jehovah was facilitated by the agreement of their vowel points. <span class="accented">The locus classicus</span> for its signification is <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, in which God defines himself as "I am that I am," and commands Moses to tell the children of Israel that <span class="accented">Ehyeh</span> had sent him. Hengstenberg and Keil conclude that absolute self-existence is the essential idea represented by the name (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4, 8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">vd</span>. Furst, 'Lex. sub nora.'). Baumgarten and Delitzsch, laying stress on its future form, regard it as   =   the Becoming One, with reference to the revelation, rather than the essence, of the Divine nature. Macdonald, from the circumstance that it was not used till after the fall, discovers a pointing forward to Jehovah <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in connection with redemption. Others, deriving from a hiphil future, take it as denoting "<span class="accented">he</span> who causes to be, the Fulfiller," and find in this an explanation of <a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a> (Exell). May not all these ideas be more or less involved in the fullness of the Divine name? As distinguished from Elohim, <span class="accented">Deus omnipotens</span>, the mighty One, Jehovah is the absolute, self-existent One, who manifests himself to man, and, in particular, enters into distinct covenant engagements for his redemption, which he in due time fulfils. In the present section the names are conjoined partly to identify Jehovah with Elohim, and partly because the subject of which it treats is the history of man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-5.htm">Genesis 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <i>there was</i> not a man to till the ground.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every plant of the field before it was</span> (literally, not yet) <span class="cmt_word">in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew</span> (literally, had not yet sprouted). Following the LXX., the English Version suggests an intention on the writer's part to emphasize the fact that the vegetation of the globe - here comprehended under the general terms, <span class="accented">shiah</span>, shrub, and <span class="accented">eseb</span>, herb - was not a natural production, but, equally with the great earth and heavens, was the creation of Jehovah Elohim - a rendering which has the sanction of Taylor Lewis; whereas the writer's object clearly is to depict the appearance of the earth at the time when the man-ward development of the heavens and the earth began. Then not a single plant was in the ground, not a green blade was visible. The land, newly sprung from the waters, was one desolate region of bleak, bare lava-hills and extensive mud-fiats. Up to that point the absence of vegetation is accounted for by the circumstance that the presently existing atmospheric conditions of the globe had not then been established, <span class="cmt_word">for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth</span>, and the ordinary agricultural operations on which its production was afterwards to depend had not then been begun, <span class="cmt_word">and there was not a man to till the ground</span>.

Jehovah thus <span class="accented">caused it to rain</span> upon the ground, and so prepared it for the vegetation which, in obedience to the Almighty fiat, sprung up at the close of the third day, although the writer does not mention its appearance, but leaves it to be inferred from the preceding section. That soon after its emergence from the waters the land should be "dry, sterile, and sandy" will not be thought remarkable if we remember the highly igneous condition of our planet at the time when the dry land was upheaved and the waters gathered into the subsiding valleys. Nothing would more naturally follow that event than the steaming up of vapors to float in the aerial sea. In fact, the rapidity with which evaporation would be carried on would very speedily leave the newly-formed land hard and dry, baked and caked into a crust, till the atmosphere, becoming overcharged with aqueous vapor, returned it in the shape of rain. To talk of insuperable difficulty and manifest dissonance where everything is clear, natural, and harmonious is to speak at random, and betrays an anxiety to create contradictions rather than to solve them.

Here, again, Bleek, Kalisch, and the theologians of their school discover contrariety between this account of man's creation and that which has been given in the preceding chapter. <span class="accented">In that</span> man is represented as having been created by the Divine word, in the Divine image, and male and female simultaneously; whereas <span class="accented">in this</span> his creation is exhibited as a painful process of elaboration from the clay by the hand of God, who works it like a potter (<span class="accented">asah</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), and, after having first constructed man, by a subsequent operation forms woman. But the first account does not assert that Adam and Eve were created together, and gives no details of the formation of either. These are supplied by the present narrative, which, beginning with the construction of his body from the fine dust of the ground, designedly represents it as an evolution or development of the material universe, and ends by setting it before us as animated by the breath of God, reserving for later treatment the mode of Eve's production, when the circumstances that led to it have been described. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (the Lord God) <span class="cmt_word">breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span> Literally, the breath of lives. "The formation of man from the dust and the breathing of the breath of life must not be understood in a mechanical sense, as if God first of all constructed a human figure from the dust" (still less does it admit of the idea that man's physical nature was evolved from the lower animals), "and then, by breathing his breath of life into the clod of earth which he had shaped into the form of a man, made it into a living being. The words are to be understood <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. By an act of Divine omnipotence man arose from the dust; and in the same moment in which the dust, by virtue of creative omnipotence, shaped itself into a human form, it was pervaded by the Divine breath of life, and created a living being, so that we cannot say the body was earlier than the soul" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">And man became a</span> <span class="cmt_word">living soul</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh chayyah</span>, in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, 80, is employed to designate the lower animals. Describing a being animated by a <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> or life principle, it does not necessarily imply that the basis of the life principle in man and the inferior animals is the same. The distinction between the two appears from the difference in the mode of their creations. The beasts arose at the almighty fiat completed beings, every one a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>. "The origin of their soul was coincident with that of their corporeality, and their life was merely the individualization of the universal life with which all matter was filled at the beginning by the Spirit of God" (Delitzsch). Man received his life from a distinct act of Divine inbreathing; certainly not an in-breathing of atmospheric air, but an inflatus from the Ruach Elohim, or Spirit of God, a communication from the whole personality of the Godhead. In effect man was thereby constituted a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>, like the lower animals; but in him the life principle conferred a personality which was wanting in them. Thus there is no real contradiction, scarcely even an "<span class="accented">apparent</span> dissonance," between the two accounts of man's creation. The second exhibits the foundation of that likeness to God and world-dominion ascribed to him in the first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And out of the ground made the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight</span> - literally, lovely to see; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> beautiful in form and color - <span class="cmt_word">and good for food</span>. In the preparation of man's pristine abode respect was had to ornamentation as well as utility. Every species of vegetation that could minister to his corporeal necessities was provided. Flowers, trees, and shrubs regaled his senses with their fragrance, pleased his eye with their exquisite forms and enchanting colors, and gratified his palate with their luscious fruits. Hence the garden of the Lord became the highest ideal of earthly excellence (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>). In particular it was distinguished by the presence of two trees, which occupied a central position among its multifarious productions. <span class="cmt_word">The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</span> That these were not two separate trees, but only one tree distinguished by different names, has been maintained, though with no weightier reason than the statement of Eve in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-3.htm">Genesis 3:3</a>. The opinion of Witsius, Luther, Kennicott, and Hengstenberg, that classes of trees, and not individual trees, are meant by the phrases "tree of life" and "tree of knowledge," is precluded by the language of Jehovah Elohim in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> and <a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>. As regards their significance, consistency requires that they should both be explained on the same principle. This, accordingly, disposes of the idea that the tree of life (literally, the tree of the lives: cf. <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; 20:19) is simply a Hebraism for <span class="accented">a living tree</span>, as by no sort of ingenuity can the tree of knowledge be transformed into <span class="accented">a knowing tree</span>. It likewise militates against the notion that the two trees were styled from the peculiar effects of their fruits, the one conferring physical immortality on Adam's body (Scotus, Aquinas, Fairbairn, Kalisch, Luther), and the other imparting moral and intellectual intuitions to his soul (Josephus, Kalisch). But even if the life-giving properties of the one tree could be demonstrated from <a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, proof would still be required with regard to the other, that the mere physical processes of manducation and digestion could be followed by results so immaterial as those of "rousing the slumbering intellect, teaching reason to reflect, and enabling the judgment to distinguish between moral good and moral evil" (Kalisch). Besides, if this was the immediate effect of eating the forbidden fruit, it is difficult to perceive either why it should have been prohibited to our first parents at all, it being "for their good to have their wits sharpened" (Willet); or in what respect they suffered loss through listening to the tempter, and did not rather gain (Rabbi Moses); or wherein, being destitute of both intellectual and moral discernment, they could be regarded as either guilty of transgression or responsible for obedience. Incapacity to know good and evil may be a characteristic of unconscious childhood and unreflecting youth (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-39.htm">Deuteronomy 1:39</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>), or of debilitated age (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>), but is not conceivable in the case of one who was created in God's image, invested with world-dominion, and himself constituted the subject of moral government. Unless, therefore, with ancient Gnostics and modern Hegelians, we view the entire story of the probation as an allegorical representation of the necessary intellectual and ethical development of human nature, we must believe that Adam was acquainted with the idea of moral distinctions from the first. Hence the conclusion seems to force itself upon our minds that the first man was possessed of both immortality and knowledge irrespective altogether of the trees, and that the tree character which belonged to these trees was symbolical or sacramental, suggestive of the conditions under which he was placed in Eden. "Arbori autem vitae nomen indidit, non quod vitam homini conferrer, qua jam ante praeditus erat; sod ut symbolum ac memoriale esset vitae divinitus acceptae" (Calvin). For a further exposition of the exact significance of these trees see below on vers. 16,17. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The precise locality of Eden is indicated by its relation to the great watercourses of the region. <span class="cmt_word">And a river</span> (literally, a flowing water, applicable to large oceanic floods - <a href="../../par/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> - as well as to narrow streams) <span class="cmt_word">went out</span> (literally, going out) <span class="cmt_word">of Eden to water the garden.</span> To conclude from this that the river had its source within the limits of the garden is to infer more than the premises will warrant. Nothing more is implied in the language than that a great watercourse proceeded through the district of Eden, and served to irrigate the soil. Probably it intersected the garden, thus occasioning its remarkable fecundity and beauty. <span class="cmt_word">And from thence</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> either on emerging from which, or, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5df;</span> in its secondary sense, outside of, or at a distance from which) <span class="cmt_word">it was parted</span> (literally, divided itself), <span class="cmt_word">and became into four heads.</span> <span class="accented">Roshim</span>, from <span class="accented">rosh</span>, that which is highest; either principal waters, arms or branches (Taylor Lewis, Alford), or beginnings of rivers, indicating the sources of the streams (Gesenius, Keil, Macdonald, Murphy). If the second of these interpretations be adopted, Eden must be looked for in a spot where some great flowing water is subdivided into four separate streams; if the former be regarded as the proper exegesis, then any great river which is first formed by the junction of two streams, and afterwards disperses its waters in two different directions, will meet the requirements of the case. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">The name of the first <i>is</i> Pison: that <i>is</i> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <i>there is</i> gold;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The name of the first</span> (river is) <span class="cmt_word">Pishon</span>, or "the full-flowing."

From this description it appears that Havilah must be sought for among the gold-producing countries of Asia. Now among the sons of Joktan or primitive Arabs (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>) - "whose dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest, unto Sephar, a mount of the east" - are Ophir and Havilah, whence Gesenius concludes that India, including Arabia, is meant. Other countries have their advocates, such as Arabia Felix, Susiana, Colchis, &c.; and other rivers, such as the Ganges (Josephus, Eusebius), the Phasis (Reland, Jahn, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Winer), the Indus (Schulthess, Kalisch).

"Deep-flowing," T.

Under the impression that the African Cush was meant, the Alexandrine Jews discovered the Gihon in the Nile - an opinion in which they have been followed by Schulthess, Gesenius, Furst, Bertheau, Kalisch, and others. But Cush, it is now known, describes the entire region between Arabia and the Nile, and in particular the southern district of the former lying between the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Hence Tayler Lewis finds the Gihon in the ocean water sweeping round the south coast of Arabia. Murphy detects the name Kush in the words Caucasus and Caspian, and, looking for the site of Eden about the sources of the Euphrates and the Tigris in Armenia, thinks the Gihon may have been the leading stream flowing into the Caspian. Delitzsch advocates the claim of the Araxis to be this river. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-14.htm">Genesis 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">And the name of the third river <i>is</i> Hiddekel: that <i>is</i> it which goeth toward the east of Assyria.

It is unanimously agreed that this must be identified with the Tigris; in the present language of the Persians designated <span class="accented">tir</span>, which signifies an arrow.

Further description of this great water was unnecessary, being universally known to the Hebrews as "the great river" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>), and "the river" <span class="accented">par excellence</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>). The river still bears its early name. In the cuneiform inscriptions deciphered by Rawlinson it is called "Ufrata." Recurring now to the site of Eden, it must be admitted that, notwithstanding this description, the whole question is involved in uncertainty. The two solutions of the problem that have the greatest claim on our attention are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that which places Eden near the head of the Persian Gulf, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that which looks for it in Armenia. The latter is favored by the close proximity to that region of the sources of both the Euphrates and the Tigris; but, on the other hand, it is hampered by the difficulty of discovering other two rivers that will correspond with the Gihon and the Pison, and the almost certainty that Cush and Havilah are to be sought for in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf. The former (Calvin, Kalisch, T. Lewis) is supported by this last consideration, that Cush and Havilah are not remote from the locality, though it too has its encumbrances. It seems to reverse the idea of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, which according to Le Clerc indicates the direction of the stream. Then its advocates, no more than the supporters of the alternate theory, are agreed upon the Gihon and the Pison: Calvin finding them in the two principal mouths of the Euphrates and the Tigris, which Sir Charles Lyell declares to be of comparatively recent formation; Kalisch identifying them with the Indus and the Nile; and Taylor Lewis regarding them as the two sides of the Persian Gulf. Sir H. Rawlinson, from a study of the Assyrian texts, has pointed out the coincidence of the Babylonian region of Karduniyas or Garduniyas with the Eden of the Bible; and the late George Smith finds in its four rivers, Euphrates, Tigris, Surappi, and Ukui, its known fertility, and its name, Gandunu, so similar to Ganeden (the garden of Eden), "considerations all tending towards the view that it is the paradise of Genesis" ('Chald. Genesis,' pp. 3-305).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehovah Elohim commanded the man</span> (Adam), <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>. Whether or not these were the first words listened to by man (Murphy), they clearly presuppose the person to whom they were addressed to have had the power of understanding language, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of interpreting vocal sounds, and representing to his own mind the conceptions or ideas of which they were the signs, a degree of intellectual development altogether incompatible with modern evolution theories. They likewise assume the pre-existence of a moral nature which could recognize the distinction between "<span class="accented">thou</span> shalt" and "<span class="accented">thou</span> shalt not." <span class="cmt_word">Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat</span>; literally, eating, thou shalt eat. Adam, it thus appears, was permitted to partake of the tree of life; not, however, as a means of either conferring or preserving immortality, which was already his by Divine gift, and the only method of conserving which recognized by the narrative was abstaining from the tree of knowledge; but as a symbol and guarantee of that immortality with which he had been endowed, and which would continue to be his so long as he maintained his personal integrity. This, of course, by the very terms of his existence, he was under obligation to do, apart altogether from any specific enactment which God might enjoin. As a moral being, he had the law written on his conscience. But, as if to give a visible embodiment to that law, and at the same time to test his allegiance to his Maker's will, which is the kernel of all true obedience, an injunction was laid upon him of a positive description - <span class="cmt_word">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</span>. Speculations as to what kind of tree it was, whether a vine, a fig, or an apple tree, are more curious than profitable. There is no reason to suppose that any noxious or lethiferous properties resided in its fruit. The death that was to follow on transgression was to spring from the <span class="accented">eating</span>, and not from the fruit; from the sinful act, and not from the creature, which in itself was good. The prohibition laid on Adam was for the time being a summary of the Divine law. Hence the tree was a sign and symbol of what that law required. And in this, doubtless, lies the explanation of its name. It was a concrete representation of that fundamental distinction between right and wrong, duty and sin, which lies at the basis of all responsibility. It interpreted for the first pair those great moral intuitions which had been implanted in their natures, and by which it was intended they should regulate their lives. Thus it was for them a tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It brought out that knowledge which they already possessed into the clear light of definite conviction and precept, connecting it at the same time with the Divine will as its source and with themselves as its end. Further, it was an intelligible declaration of the duty which that knowledge of good and evil imposed upon them. Through its penalty it likewise indicated both the good which would be reaped by obedience and the evil which would follow on transgression. <span class="cmt_word">For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</span>; literally, dying, thou shalt die. That this involved death physical, or the dissolution of the body, is indicated by the sentence pronounced on Adam after he had fallen (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). That the sentence was hot immediately executed does not disprove its reality. It only suggests that its suspension may have been due to some Divine interposition. Yet universal experience attests that permanent escape from its execution is impossible. In the case of Adam it was thus far put in force on the instant, that henceforth he ceased to be immortal. As prior to his fall his immortality was sure, being authenticated for him by the tree of life, so now, subsequent to that catastrophe, his mortality was certain. This, more than immediateness, is what the language implies. For the complete theological significance of this penalty see <a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God said, <i>It is</i> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - In anticipation of the ensuing narrative of the temptation and the fall, the historian, having depicted man's settlement in Eden, advances to complete his <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span> by the introduction upon the scene of the animals and woman. In the preliminary creation record (7-27) it is simply stated that God created man, male and female; there is a complete absence of details as to the Divine <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> in the execution of these, his last and greatest works. It is one object, among others, of the second portion of the history to supply those details. With regard to man (Adam), an account of his formation, at once minute and exhaustive, has been given in the preceding verses (7-17); now, with like attention to antecedent and concomitant circumstances and events, the sacred penman adds a description of the time, reason, manner, and result of the formation of woman. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God said, It is not good for man to be alone.</span> While the animals were produced either in swarms (as the fishes) or in pairs (as the birds and beasts), man was created as an individual; his partner, by a subsequent operation of creative power, being produced from himself. With the wild phantasies and gross speculations of some theosophists, as to whether, prior to the creation of Eve, Adam was androgynic (Bohme), or simply <span class="accented">vir</span> in <span class="accented">potentia</span>, out of which state he passed the moment the woman stood by his side (Ziegler), a devout exegesis is not required to intermeddle. Neither is it needful to wonder how God should pronounce that to be not good which he had previously (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>) affirmed was good. The Divine judgment of which the preceding chapter speaks was expressed at the completion of man's creation; this, while that creation was in progress. For the new-made man to have been left without a partner would, in the estimation of Jehovah Elohim, have been for him a condition of being which, if not necessarily bad in itself, yet, considering his intellectual and social nature, "would eventually have passed over from the negative not good, or a manifest want, into the positive not good, or a hurtful impropriety"' (Lange). "It was not good for man to be alone; not, as certain foolish Rabbis conceited, lest he should imagine himself to be the lord of the world, or as though no man could live without a woman, which is contrary to Scripture; but in respect of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> mutual society and comfort, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the propagation of the race, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the increase and generation of the Church of God, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the promised seed of the woman (Willet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Accordingly, Jehovah Elohim, for whom (seeing that his nature is to dispense happiness to his creatures) no more than for Adam would it have been good that man, being what he <span class="accented">was</span>, should remain alone, said, <span class="cmt_word">I will provide a help meet for him</span>; literally, an helper, as over against him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> corresponding to him, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; ver. 20, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, LXX. The expression indicates that the forthcoming helper was to be of similar nature to the man himself, corresponding by way of supplement to the incompleteness of his lonely being, and in every way adapted to be his co-partner and companion. All that Adam's nature demanded for its completion, physically, intellectually, socially, was to be included in this <span class="accented">altera ego</span> who was soon to stand by his side. Thus in man s need, and woman's power to satisfy that need, is laid the foundation for the Divine institution of marriage, which was afterwards prescribed not for the first pair alone, but for all their posterity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a></div><div class="verse">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought <i>them</i> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that <i>was</i> the name thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span>  - <span class="cmt_word">And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air.</span> To allege that the Creator's purpose to provide a helpmeet for Adam seeks realization through the production of the animals (Kalisch, Alford) proceeds upon a misapprehension of the proper nexus which binds the thoughts of the historian, and a want of attention to the peculiar structure of Hebrew composition, besides exhibiting Jehovah Elohim in the character of an empiric who only tentatively discovers the sort of partner that is suitable for man. It is not the time, but simply the fact, of the creation of the animals that the historian records. The <span class="accented">Vav</span>. consec. does not necessarily involve time-succession, but is frequently employed to indicate thought-sequence (cf. 2:8; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-13.htm">1 Kings 2:13</a>, &c.). The verb (pret.) may also quite legitimately be rendered "had formed (Bush). "Our modern style of expressing the Semitic writer's thought would be this - 'And God brought to Adam the beasts which he had formed (Delitzsch). It is thus unnecessary to defend the record from a charge of inconsistency with the previous section, by supposing this to be the account of a second creation of animals in the district of Eden. Another so-called contradiction, that the present narrative takes no account of the creation of aquatic animals, is disposed of by observing that the writer only notices that those animals which were brought to Adam had been previously formed by God from the ground, and were thus in the line of the onward evolutions of the heavens and the earth which led up to mare As to why the fishes were not brought into the garden, if other reason is required besides that of physical impossibility, the ingenuity of Keil suggests that these were not so nearly related to Adam as the fowls and the beasts, which, besides, were the animals specially ordained for his service. <span class="cmt_word">And brought them</span> (literally, brought; not necessarily all the animals in Eden, but specimens of them) unto <span class="cmt_word">Adam</span>. We agree with Willet in believing that "neither did Adam gather together the cattle as a shepherd doth his sheep, nor did the angels muster them, nor the animals come themselves, and, passing by, while he sat on some elevation, bow their heads at his resplendent appearance; nor were Adam's eyes so illuminate that he beheld them all in their places - all which," says he, "are but men's conceits; but that through the secret influence of God upon their natures they were assembled round the inmate of paradise, as afterwards they were collected in the ark. The reasons for this particular action on the part of God were manifold; one of them being stated in the words which follow - <span class="cmt_word">to see what he would call them</span>; literally, to them. Already man had received from God his first lesson in the exercise of speech, in the naming of the trees and the imposition of the prohibition. This was his second - the opportunity afforded him of using for himself that gift of language and reason with which he had been endowed. In this it is implied that man was created with the faculty of speech, the distinct gift of articulate and rational utterance, and the capacity of attaching words to ideas, though it also seems to infer that the evolution of a language was for him, as it is for the individual yet, a matter of gradual development. Another reason was to manifest his sovereignty or lordship over the inferior creation. <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever Adam</span> (literally, the man) <span class="cmt_word">called every living creature</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> that was brought to him), <span class="cmt_word">that was the name thereof.</span> That is to say, it not only met the Divine approbation as exactly suitable to the nature of the creature, and thus was a striking attestation of the intelligence and wisdom of the first man, but it likewise adhered to the creature as a name which had been assigned by its master. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-20.htm">Genesis 2:20</a></div><div class="verse">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field.</span> The portrait here delineated of the first man is something widely different from that of an infantile savage slowly groping his way towards the possession of articulate speech and intelligible language by imitation of the sounds of animals. Speech and language both spring full-formed, though not completely matured, from the <span class="accented">primus</span> homo of the Bible. As to the names that Adam gave the animals, with Calvin we need not doubt that they were founded on the best of reasons, though what they were it is impossible to discover, as it is not absolutely certain that Adam spoke in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</span> This was the chief reason for assembling the creatures. It was meant to reveal his loneliness. The longing for a partner was already deeply seated in his nature, and the survey of the animals, coming to him probably in pairs, could not fail to intensify that secret hunger of his soul, and perhaps evoke it into conscious operation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept.</span> This was clearly not a sleep of weariness or fatigue, in consequence of arduous labors undergone, but a supernatural slumber, which, however, may have been superinduced upon the natural condition of repose. Lightfoot, following the LXX. who translate <span class="accented">tardemah</span> (deep sleep) by <span class="accented">ecstasy</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, imagines that the whole scene of Eve's creation was presented to Adam's imagination in a Divinely-inspired dream, which has at least the countenance of <a href="../../par/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a> Such a supposition, however, is not required to account for Adam's recognition of his bride. There is more of aptness in the observation of Lange, that in the deep sleep of Adam we have an echo of the area-tire evenings that preceded the Divine activity. "Everything out of which some new thing is to come sinks down before the event into such a deep sleep, is the farseeing and comprehensive remark of Ziegler. <span class="cmt_word">And he took one of his ribs</span> (<span class="accented">tsela</span>   =   something bent, from <span class="accented">tesala</span>, to incline; hence a rib), <span class="cmt_word">and closed up the flesh</span> (literally, flesh) <span class="cmt_word">instead thereof</span>. Whether Adam was created with a superfluous rib, or his body was mutilated by the abstraction of a rib, is a question for the curious. In the first, Calvin finds nothing "which is not in accordance with Divine providence," while he favors the latter conjecture, and thinks that Adam got a rich compensation - "quum se integrum vidit in uxore, qui prius tantum dimidius erat." Luther inclines to think that Adam's language in ver. 23 implies that not the bare rib, but the rib with the accompanying flesh, was extracted.

The peculiar phraseology employed to describe the formation of Adam s partner has been understood as referring to the physical configuration of woman s body, which is broadest towards the middle (Lyra); to the incompleteness of Adam's being, which was like an unfinished building until Eve was formed (Calvin); to the part of the female in building up the family (Delitzsch, Macdonald), to the building up of the Church, of which she was designed to be a type (Bonar); - yet it may be doubted if there is not as much truth in the remark that "by the many words used in the generation of mankind, as <span class="accented">creating</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), <span class="accented">making</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>), forming and <span class="accented">inspiring</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), and now <span class="accented">building</span>, Moses would set forth this wondrous workmanship for which the Psalmist so laudeth God," <a href="../../par/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a> (Ainsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And brought her unto the man.</span> I.e. led, conducted, and presented her to Adam.

"The thrice repeated <span class="accented">this is</span> characteristic.

Not partially (Pye Smith), but completely destitute of clothing. Diodorus Siculus and Plato both mention nakedness as a feature of the golden age and a characteristic of the first men (<span class="accented">vide</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">Scholia in love</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The man and his wife</span>.

Not because they were wholly uncultivated and their moral insight undeveloped (Knobel, Kalisch); but because their souls were arrayed in purity, and "their bodies were made holy through the spirit which animated them" (Keil). "They were naked, but yet they were not so. Their bodies were the clothing of their internal glory; and their internal glory was the clothing of their nakedness" (Delitzsch). It is not surprising that the primeval history of mankind should have left its impress upon the current of tradition. The Assyrian tablets that relate to man are so fragmentary and mutilated that they can scarcely be rendered intelligible. So far as they have been deciphered, the first appears on its obverse side "to give the speech of the Deity to the newly-created pair (man and woman), instructing them in their duties," in which can be detected a reference' to something which is eaten by the stomach, to the duty of daily invocation of the Deity, to the danger of leaving God's fear, in which alone they can be holy, and to the propriety of trusting only a friend; and on its reverse what resembles a discourse to the first woman on her duties, in which occur the words, "With the lord of thy beauty thou shalt be faithful: to do evil thou shalt not approach him" ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 78-80). The Persian legend describes Meschia and Meschiane, the first parents of our race, as living in purity and innocence, and in the enjoyment of happiness which Ormuzd promised to render perpetual if they persevered in virtue. But Ahriman, an evil demon (Dev), suddenly appeared in the form of a serpent, and gave them of the fruit of a wonderful tree. The literature of the Hin-does distinguishes four ages of the world, in the first of which Justice, in the form of a bull, kept herself firm on her four feet; when Virtue reigned, no good which the mortals possessed was mixed with baseness, and man, free from disease, saw all his wishes accomplished, and attained an age of 400 years. The Chinese also have their age of happy men, living in abundance of food, and surrounded by the peaceful beasts ('Kalisch on Genesis,' p. 87). In the Zendavesta, Yima, the first Iranic king, lives in a secluded spot, where he and his people enjoy uninterrupted happiness, in a region free from sin, folly, violence, poverty, deformity. The Teutonic Eddas have a glimpse of the same truth in their magnificent drinking halls, glittering with burnished gold, where the primeval race enjoyed a life of perpetual festivity. Traces of a similar belief are found among the Thibetans, Mongolians, Cingalese, and others (Rawlinson's 'Hist. Illustrations of Scripture,' p. 10). The Western traditions are familiar to scholars in the pages of Hesiod, who speaks of the golden age when men were like the gods, free from labors, troubles, cares, and all evils in general; when the earth yielded her fruits spontaneously, and when men were beloved by the gods, with whom they held uninterrupted communion (Hesiod, 'Opera et Dies,' 90). And of Ovid, who adds to this picture the element of moral goodness as a characteristic of the <span class="accented">aurea aetas</span> ('Metam.,' 1:89). Macrobius ('Somn. Scipionis,' 2:10) also depicts this period as one in which reigned <span class="accented">simplicitas mali nescia et adhuc astutiae inexperta</span> (Maedonald, 'Creation and the Fall,' p. 147). "<span class="accented">These</span> coincidences affect the originality of the Hebrew writings as little as the frequent resemblance of Mosaic and heathen laws. They teach us that all such narratives have a common source; that they are reminiscences of primeval traditions modified by the different nations in accordance with their individual culture" (Kalisch) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../genesis/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Genesis 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Genesis 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../genesis/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Genesis 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Genesis 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
