Homer, 'Odys,' 5:239, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). This tower is commonly identified with the temple of Belus, which Herodotus describes (1. 181) as being quadrangular (two stadia each way), and having gates of brass, with a solid tower in the middle, consisting of eight sections, each a stadium in height, placed one above another, ascended by a spiral staircase, and having in the top section a spacious temple with a golden table and a well-furnished bed. Partially destroyed by Xerxes ( <span class="date">B.C. 490</span>), it was attempted unsuccessfully to be rebuilt by Alexander the Great; but the remaining portion of the edifice was known to be in existence five centuries later, and was sufficiently imposing to be recognized as the temple of Belus (Pliny, 6:30). The site of this ancient tower is supposed by George Smith to be covered by the ruin "Babil," a square mound about 200 yards each way, in the north of the city; and that of the tower of Babel to be occupied by the ruin Birs-Nimrod (situated six miles south-west of Hillah, which is about forty miles west of Bagdad), a tower consisting of seven stages, said by inscriptions on cylinders extracted from the ruin to have been "the Temple of the Seven Planets, which had been partially built by a former king of Babylon, and, having fallen into decay, was restored and completed by Nebuchadnezzar" ('Assyrian Discoveries,' 12. p. 59; 'Chaldaean Genesis,' p. 163; cf. Layard's 'Nineveh and Babylon,' chap. 22. p. 496). It is, however, <span class="accented">prima facie</span>, unlikely that either Babil or Birs-Nimrod is the exact site of Babel. The original building was never finished, and may not have attained any great dimensions. Perhaps the most that can be said is that these existing mounds enable us to picture what sort of erection the tower of Babel was to be. <span class="cmt_word">And let us make a name</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>; neither an idol temple, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span> being   =   God, which it never is without the article, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>  - cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a> (Jewish writers); nor a monument, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a> (Clericus); nor a metropolis, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a> (Clericus); nor a tower that might serve as a sign to guide the wandering nomads and guard them against getting lost when spread abroad with their flocks, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-13.htm">Isaiah 55:13</a> (Perizonius, Dathe, Ilgen); but a name, a reputation, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-12.htm">Isaiah 63:12, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a> (Luther, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth, Kalisch). This was the first impelling motive to the erection of the city and tower. The offspring of ambition, it was designed to spread abroad their fame <span class="accented">usque ad ultimos terrarum fines</span> (Calvin). According to Philo, each man wrote his name upon a brick before he built it in.

But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> modern philology has as yet only succeeded in explaining the growth of what might be called the sub-modifications of human speech, and is confessedly unable to account for what appears to be its main division into a Shemitic, an Aryan, and a Turanian tongue, which may have been produced in the sudden and miraculous way described; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> nothing prevents us from regarding the two events, the confusion of tongues and the dispersion of the nations, as occurring simultaneously, and even acting and reacting on each other. As the tribes parted, their speech would diverge, and, on the other hand, as the tongues differed, those who spoke the same or cognate dialects would draw together and draw apart from the rest. We may even suppose that, prior to the building of Babel, if any of the human family had begun to spread themselves abroad upon the surface of the globe, a slight diversity in human speech had begun to show itself; and the truthfulness of the narrative will in no wise be endangered by admitting that the Divine interposition at Babel may have consisted in quickening a natural process which had already commenced to operate; nay, we are rather warranted to conclude that the whole work of subdividing human speech was not compressed into a moment of time, but, after receiving this special impulse, was left to develop and complete itself as the nations wandered farther and ever farther from the plains of Shinar (cf. Kurtz, 'Hist. of the Old Covenant,' vol. 1. pp. 108-117 (Clark's For. Theol. Lib.), and 'Quarry on Genesis,' pp. 195-206). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>CHALDAEAN LEGEND OF THE TOWER OF BABEL. Berosus, indeed, does not refer to it, and early writers are obliged to have recourse to somewhat doubtful authorities to confirm it. Eusebius, e.g., quotes Abydenus as saying that "not long after the Flood, the ancient race of men were so puffed up with their strength and tallness of stature that they began to despise and contemn the gods, and labored to erect that very lofty tower which is now called Babylon, intending thereby to scale the heaven& But when the building approached the sky, behold, the gods called in the aid of the winds, and by their help overturned the tower, and cast it to the ground! The name of the ruin is still called Babel, because until this time all men had used the same speech; but now there was sent upon them a confusion of many and diverse tongues" ('Praep. Ev.,' 9:14). But the diligence of the late George Smith has been rewarded by discovering the fragment of an Assyrian tablet (marked If, 3657 in British Museum) containing an account of the building of the tower, in which the gods are represented as being angry at the work and confounding the speech of the builders. In col. 1, lines 5 and 6 (according to W. St. C.

First named on account of his spiritual pre-eminence. If Abram was Terah's eldest son, then, as Abram was seventy-five years of age when Terah died (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), Terah's whole life could only have been 145 years. But Terah lived to the age of 205 years (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>); therefore Abram was born in Terah's 130th year. This, however, makes it surprising that Abraham should have reckoned it impossible for him to have a son at 100 years (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>); only, after having lived so long in childless wedlock, it was not strange that he should feel somewhat doubtful of any issue by Sarai. Kalisch believes that Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-4.htm">Acts 7:4</a>) made a mistake in saying Terah died before his son's migration from Charran, and that he really survived that event by sixty years; while the Samaritan text escapes the difficulty by shortening the life of Terah to 145 years. <span class="cmt_word">And Nahor</span>, who must have been younger than Haran, since he married Haran's daughter. <span class="cmt_word">And Haran</span>, who, as the eldest, must have been born in Terah's seventieth year. Thus the second family register, like the flint, concludes after ten generations with the birth of three sons, who, like Noah's, are mentioned not in the order of their ages, but of their spiritual pre-eminence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> From this table it appears that 292 years, according to the Hebrew text, passed away between the Flood and the birth, or 292 +75   =    =   367 between the Flood and the call of Abraham. Reckoning, however, the age of Torah at Abram's birth as 130 (<span class="accented">vide</span>  Exposition), the full period between the Deluge and the patriarch's departure from Haran will be 367 + 60   =    =   427 years, which, allowing five pairs to each family, Murphy computes, would in the course of ten generations yield a population of 15,625,000 souls; or, supposing a rate of increase equal to that of Abraham's posterity in Egypt during the 400 years that elapsed from the call to the exodus, the inhabitants of the world in the time of Abraham would be between seven and eight millions. It must, however, be remembered that an element of uncertainty enters into all computations based upon even the Hebrew text. The age of Terah at the birth (apparently) of Abram is put down at seventy. But it admits of demonstration that Abram was born in the 130th year of Terah. What guarantee then do we possess that in every instance the registered son was the firstborn? In the case of Arphaxad this is almost implied in the statement that he was born two years after the Flood. But if the case of Eber were parallel with that of Terah, and Joktan were the son that he begat in his thirty-fourth year, then obviously the birth of Peleg, like that of Abram, may have happened sixty years later; in which case it is apparent that any reckoning which proceeded on the minute verbal accuracy of the registered numbers would be entirely at fault. This consideration might have gone far to explain the wide divergence between the numbers of the Samaritan and Septuagint as compared with the Hebrew text, had it not been that they both agree with it in setting down seventy as the age of Terah at the date of Abram's birth. The palpable artificiality also of these later tables renders them even less worthy of credit than the Hebrew. The introduction by the LXX. of Cainan as the son of Arphaxad, though seemingly confirmed by Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/3-35.htm">Luke 3:35, 36</a>), is clearly an interpolation. It does not occur in the LXX. version of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-24.htm">1 Chronicles 1:24</a>, and is not found in either the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Targums or the ancient versions, in Josephus or Philo, or in the Codex Beza of the Gospel of Luke. Its appearance in Luke (and probably also in the LXX.) can only be explained as an interpolation. Wordsworth is inclined to regard it as authentic in Luke, and to suppose that Cainaan was excluded from the Mosaic table either to render it symmetrical, as Luke's table is rendered symmetrical by its insertion, or because of some moral offence, which, though necessitating his expulsion from a Hebrew register, would not prevent his reappearance in his proper place under the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The term Ur has been explained to be identical with It, a city (Rawlinson); the Zend Vare, a fortress (Gesenius); <span class="accented">Ur</span>, the light country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of the sun-rising (Furst); and even <span class="accented">Ur, <[Vol 1/Genesis/173]PGBR></span> fire, with special reference to the legendary furnace already referred to (Talmudists). Whether a district (LXX., Lange, Kalisch) or a city (Josephus, Eusebius, Onkelos, Drnsius, Keil, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'), its exact site is uncertain. Rival claimants for the honor of representing it have appeared in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a Persian fortress (Persicum Castellum) of the name of Ur, mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus (75. 100. 8) as lying between Nisibis and the Tigris (Bochart, Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the modern Orfah, the Edsssa of the Greeks, situated "on one of the bare, rugged spurs which descend from the mountains of Armenia into the Assyrian plains" (Stanley's 'Jewish Church,' 1:7); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hur, the most important of the early capitals of Chaldaea, now the ruins of Mugheir, at no great distance from the mouth, and six miles to the west, of the Euphrates (Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:15, 16; Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' 12:233; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 9). Yet none of them is quite exempt from difficulty. A military fort, to take the first-named location, does not appear a suitable or likely place for a nomade horde to settle in; while the second has been reckoned too near Charran, the first place of encampment of the emigrants; and the third, besides being exceedingly remote from Charran, scarcely harmonises with Stephen's speech before the Sanhedrim (Acts 7:2). Unless, therefore, Stephen meant Chaldsea when he said Mesopotamia (Dykes), and Abraham could speak of Northern Mesopotamia as his country (Genesis 24:4), when in reality he belonged to Southern Babylonia, the identification of Ur of the Chaldees with the Mugheir ruin though regarded with most favor by archaeologists, will continue to be doubtful; while, if the clan march commenced at Edessa, it will always require an effort to account for their coming to a halt so soon after starting and so near home; and the Nisibis station, though apparently more suitable than either in respect of distance, will remain encumbered with its own peculiar difficulties. It would seem, therefore, as if the exact situation of the patriarchal town or country must be left undetermined until further light can be obtained.
