The shape of it is not described, but only its dimensions given. <span class="cmt_word">The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits</span>, - a cubit   =   the length from the elbow to the middle finger (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>); nearly twenty-two inches, if the sacred cubit; if the common, eighteen inches, - the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. With a cubit of twenty-one inches, the length would he 525 feet, the breadth 87 feet 6 inches, dimensions not dissimilar to those of the <span class="accented">Great Eastern</span> which is 680 feet long, 83 feet broad, and 58 feet deep. The cubic contents of the ark with these dimensions would be 2,411,718'75 feet, which, allowing forty cubic feet per ton, would give a carrying capacity equal to 32,800 tons. P. Jansen of Holland, in 1609, proved by actual experiment that a ship constructed after the pattern of the ark, though not adapted for sailing, would in reality carry a cargo greater by one-third than any other form of like cubical content. The difficulty of building a vessel of such enormous magnitude, T. Lewis thinks, may be got over by remembering the extreme simplicity of its structure, the length of time allowed for its erection, the physical constitution of the builders, and the facilities for obtaining materials which may have existed in abundance in their vicinity. Bishop Wilkins ('Essay towards a Philosophical Character and Language'), Dr. A. Clarke, and Bush are satisfied that the ark was large enough to contain all the animals directed to be taken into it, along with provision for a twelvemonth; but computations founded on the number of the species presently existing must of necessity be precarious; and besides, it is at least doubtful whether the Deluge was universal, or only partial and local, in which case the difficulty (so called) completely vanishes.

Keil and Murphy think we can form no proper conception of the light arrangement of the ark. The conjecture of Schultens, which is followed by Dathius, Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others, that the <span class="accented">tsohar</span> meant the covering (<span class="accented">tectum, dorsum</span>), "quo sane hoc aedificium carere non potuit, propter pluviam tot diernm continuam," is obviously incorrect - <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit</span> - to a cubit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all but a cubit (T.

Lewis). <span class="cmt_word">And the door of the ark</span> - the opening which should admit its inmates - <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories</span>.
