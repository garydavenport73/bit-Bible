That Isaac should have resorted to the miserable expedient of his father may have been due simply to a lack of originality on the part of Isaac; or perhaps the recollection of the success which had attended his father's adoption of this wretched subterfuge may have blinded him to its true character. But from whatever cause resulting, the resemblance between the two narratives cannot be held as destroying the credibility of either, and all the more that a careful scrutiny will detect sufficient dissimilarity between them to establish the authenticity of the incidents which they relate.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 26:12-22

Though a distinct advance on the purely nomadic life pursued by Abraham, this did not imply fixed property in, or even permanent settlement on, the soil, "but only annual tenancy" thereof. Robinson (1. 77) mentions a colony of the Tawarah Arabs, about fifty families, living near Abu Zabel, in Egypt, who cultivated the soil and yet dwelt in tents. "The Biblical patriarchs were not mere Bedawin wanderers, like those who now occupy the Eastern deserts. They had large herds of cattle, which genuine Bedawins have not; they tilled the ground, which these robbers never do; and they accommodated themselves, without difficulty or reluctance, to town and city when necessary, which wild Arabs cannot endure" ('Land and Book,' p. 296) - <span class="cmt_word">and received in the same year an hundred-fold</span> - literally, <span class="accented">an hundred measures</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for each measure of that which he sowed; an exceptional return even for Philistia, though "the country is no less fertile than the very best of the Mississippi Valley" ('Land and Book,' p. 557); and Arab grain stores at <span class="accented">Nuttar-abu-Sumar</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the vicinity of Gaza, still proclaim the remunerative yield of its harvests (Robinson, vol. 1. p. 292).

Abimelech and his ministers first explain the motive which has impelled them to solicit a renewal of the old alliance - <span class="cmt_word">that the Lord was with thee</span>: - the use of Jehovah instead of Elohim, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>, does not prove that this is a Jehovistic elaboration of the earlier legend. Neither is it necessary to suppose that the term Jehovah is a Mosaic translation of the epithet employed by Abimelech (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The long-continued residence of Abraham in Gemr and Beersheba afforded ample opportunity for Abimelech becoming acquainted with the patriarch's God. The introduction of Jehovah into the narrative may be noted as a third point of dissimilarity between this and the previous account - <span class="cmt_word">and we said, Let there he now an oath</span> - i.e. a treaty secured by an oath or self-imprecation on the transgressor (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/24-41.htm">Genesis 24:41</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11, 13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee</span>, - a farther particularization of the parties to the covenant for the sake of emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">and let us make a covenant with thee</span>. The phrase "to cut a covenant," here used in a so-called Jehovistic portion of the history, occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-27.htm">Genesis 21:27, 32</a>, which confessedly belongs to the fundamental document.

Regarded by some as an instance of adroit and pious flattery, these words are perhaps better understood as explaining either why Isaac should overlook the injuries which they had done to him (Calvin, Bush), or why he should grant them the oath which they desired (Ainsworth), - he requiring no guarantee of safety from them, since Jehovah was on his side (Murphy), - or why they had been stirred up to seek his favor and alliance (Rosenm&uuml;ller).

There is no mention of any banquet in the case of Abraham's covenant, which may be noted as another point of difference between the two transactions. A similar entertainment accompanied Jacob's covenant with Laban (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>); while in the Mosaic system the sacrificial meal formed an integral part of the regularly-appointed sacrificial worship (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7, 17</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship,' &sect; 79) - <span class="cmt_word">and they did eat and drink.</span>
