It may assist the student to arrive at a decision with respect to these contending aspirants for the throne of Pharaoh in the time of Joseph to know that Canon Cook ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 451), after an elaborate and careful as well as scholarly review of the entire question, regards it as at least "a very probable conjecture" that the Pharaoh of Joseph was Amenemha III., "who is represented on the lately-discovered table of Abydos as the last great king of all Egypt in the ancient empire (the last of the twelfth dynasty), and as such receiving divine honors from his descendant Rameses" - <span class="cmt_word">dreamed</span>. "For the third time are dreams employed as the agencies of Joseph's history: they first foreshadow his illustrious future; they then manifest that the Spirit of God had not abandoned him even in the abject condition of a slave and a prisoner; and lastly they are made the immediate forerunners of his greatness" (Kalisch.). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, he stood by the river</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> upon the banks of the Nile, the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;</span> (an Egyptian word signifying great river or canal, in the Memphitic dialect <span class="accented">yaro, in</span> the Sahidic <span class="accented">yero</span>) being used almost exclusively in Scripture for the Nile (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>; Gesenius, 'Lex., p. 326).

According to Plutarch and Clement of Alexandria, the heifer was regarded by the ancient Egyptians as a symbol of the earth, agriculture, and the nourishment derived therefrom. It was therefore natural that the succession of seven prosperous years should be represented by seven thriving cows. That they appeared ascending from the river is explained by the circumstance that the Nile by its annual inundations is the cause of Egypt's fertility (cf. Havernick, 'Introd.,' 21). A hymn to the Nile, composed by Euna (according to the generality of Egyptologers a contemporary of Moses), and translated from a papyrus in the British Museum by Canon Cook (who ascribes to it an earlier date than the nineteenth dynasty), describes the Nile as "overflowing the gardens created by Ra giving life to all animals....watering the land without ceasing... Lover of food, bestower of corn...  Bringer of food! Great Lord of provisions! Creator of all good things!" (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Records of the Past,' vol. 4. pp. 107, 108); <span class="cmt_word">And they fed in a meadow</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, (LXX.), literally, <span class="accented">in the Nile or reed grass</span>. The word XXX appears to be an Egyptian term descriptive of any herbage growing in a stream. It occurs only here and in ver. 18, and <a href="../../par/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11</a>.

This clearly pointed to the corn of the Nile valley, the <span class="accented">triticum compositum</span>, which Bears seven ears upon one stalk. The assertion of Herodotus, that the Egyptians counted it a disgrace to live on wheat and barley (2:36), Wilkinson regards as incorrect, since "both wheat and barley are noticed in Lower Egypt long before Herodotus' time (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>), and the paintings of the Thebaid prove that they were grown extensively in that part of the country; they were among the offerings in the temples; and the king, at his coronation, cutting some ears of wheat, afterwards offered to the gods as the staple production of Egypt, shows how great a value was set on a grain which Herodotus would lead us to suppose was held in abhorrence" (Rawlinson's 'Hexodotus,' vol. 2. p. 49).

It has been urged that this displays a gross ignorance of the nature, of the climate in Egypt (Bohlen), since a wind directly east is rare in Egypt, and when it does occur is not injurious to vegetation; but, on the other hand, it is open to reply <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that direct east winds may be rare in Egypt, but so are dearth and famine such as that described in the narrative equally exceptional (Kalisch); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Hebrews having only names to describe the four principal winds, the <span class="accented">kadirn</span> might comprise any wind blowing from an easterly direction (Hengstenberg); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the south-east wind, "blowing in the months of March and April, is one of the most injurious winds, and of longest continuance" (Havernick). Hengstenberg quotes Ukert as saying, "As long as the south-east wind continues, doors and windows are closed; but the fine dust penetrates everywhere; everything dries up; wooden vessels warp and crack. The thermometer rises suddenly from 16&deg; 20&deg;, up to 30&deg; 36&deg;, and even 38&deg;, Reaumur. This wind works destruction upon everything. The grass withers so that it entirely perishes if this wind blows long" ('Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 10).

That a priest's daughter should have married with a foreign shepherd may, have been distasteful to the prejudices of an intolerant priesthood (Bohlen), but in the case of Asenath and Joseph it was recommended by sundry powerful considerations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, Joseph was a descendant of Abraham, whom a former Pharaoh had recognized and honored as a prince, and ' The Story of Saneha,' a hieratic papyrus belonging to the twelfth dynasty, shows that Eastern foreigners might even become sons-in-law to the most powerful potentates under the ancient empire (vide 'Records of the Past,' vol. 6. pp. 135-150). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, Joseph was at this time grand vizier of the realm, with absolute control of the lives and fortunes of its people (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 44). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, he was obviously a favorite of Pharaoh, who, besides being monarch of the realm, was the recognized head of the priestly caste, over whom, therefore, he exercised more than a merely external authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Though a foreign shepherd Joseph had become a naturalized Egyptian, as may be gathered from <a href="../../par/genesis/43-32.htm">Genesis 43:32</a>. And, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, he was circumcised, which, if this rite was already observed in Egypt, and did not originate with Joseph, would certainly not prove a bar to the contemplated alliance (<span class="accented">vide</span> Canon Cook in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 480; Kurst, 'Hist. of Old Covenant,' &sect; 88; Hengstenberg, 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' pp. 32-35). As to the probability of Joseph consenting to become son-in-law to a heathen priest, it may suffice to remember that though marriage with idolaters was expressly forbidden by patriarchal commandment (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1</a>), and afterwards by Mosaic statute (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-16.htm">Genesis 34:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), it was sometimes contracted for what seemed a perfectly adequate reason, viz., the furtherance of the Divine purposes concerning Israel, and apparently too with the Divine sanction (cf. the cases of Moses, <a href="../../par/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>, and Esther, Esther 2:16); that Joseph may have deemed the religion of Egypt, especially in its early symbolical forms, as perfectly compatible with a pure monotheistic worship, or, if he judged it idolatrous, he may both have secured for himself complete toleration and have felt himself strong enough to resist its seductions; that Asenath may have adopted her husband's faith, though on this, of course, nothing can be affirmed; and lastly, that the narrator of this history pronounces no judgment on the moral quality of Joseph's conduct in consenting to this alliance, which, though overruled for good, may have been, considered in itself, a sin. <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt</span> in the discharge of his vice-regal duties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 41:46-57
