Hence Jacob with greater urgency renews his entreaty that Esau would not decline his proffered gift, saying, <span class="cmt_word">Take, I pray thee, my blessing</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my present, the word signifying, as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-27.htm">1 Samuel 25:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>, a gift by which one seeks to express good will) <span class="cmt_word">that is brought to thee</span>; - or, which has been caused to come to thee, adding, as a special reason to induce him to accept - <span class="cmt_word">because God hath dealt graciously with me,</span> - Elohim, it has been thought, is used here and in ver. 5 by Jacob instead of Jehovah, either "<span class="accented">to</span> avoid reminding Esau of the blessing of Jehovah which had occasioned his absence" (Delitzsch, Keil), or, " because Jehovah was exalted far above the level of Esau's superficial religion" Hengstenberg); but it is just possible that by its employment Jacob only wished to acknowledge the Divine hand in the remark- able prosperity which had attended him in Haran - <span class="cmt_word">and because I have enough</span> - literally, <span class="accented">there is to</span> me all, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. everything I can wish (Murphy), all things as the heir of the promise (Keil). The expression is stronger than that used by Esau (ver. 9), and is regarded by some (Ainsworth) as indicating a more contented spirit than that evinced by Esau. <span class="cmt_word">And he urged him</span>. In Eastern countries the acceptance of a gift is equivalent to the striking of a covenant of friendship. If your present be received by your superior yon may rely on his friendship; if it be declined you have everything to fear. It was on this ground that Jacob was so urgent in pressing Esau to accept his present (cf. A. Clarke <span class="accented">in loco</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And he took it,</span> and so gave Jacob an assurance of his complete reconciliation.

On the first hypothesis it is difficult to explain how Esau came to be traveling in the same direction as his brother, while the adoption of the second will serve in some measure to elucidate Jacob's language in ver. 2. But whichever way the words of Esau are understood, they amounted to an offer to be an escort to Jacob through the desert regions with which his excursions had made him familiar, since he added, <span class="cmt_word">and I will go before thee</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to lead the way.

Thomson says that Oriental shepherds gently lead along the mothers when in the condition spoken of by Jacob, knowing well that even one day's over-driving would be fatal to them, and, from the fact that Jacob's ewes were giving milk, infers that it was winter time, since then alone the flocks are in that condition - an inference which he further confirms by observing that at Succoth Jacob constructed booths for their protection ('Land and Book,' p. 205).

It is apparent that Jacob at first intended to accept Esau's invitation to visit him at Seir, either immediately (Clericus, Kalisch), or, as is more probable, afterwards (Keil, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'), though, if afterwards, the historian has preserved no record of any such journey, while, if presently such was his intention, he must have been providentially led, from some cause not mentioned, to alter his determination (Bush, Inglis, Clarke), unless we either think that he really went to Seir, though it is not here stated (Patrick), or entertain the, in the circumstances, almost incredible hypothesis that Jacob practiced a deception on his generous brother in order to get rid of him, by promising what he never meant to fulfill, viz., to visit him at Mount Seir (Calvin), or leave it doubtful whether it is the old Jacob or the new Israel who speaks (Lange).
