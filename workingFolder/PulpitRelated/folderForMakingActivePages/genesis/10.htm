Babylon, "the land of Nimrod" (<a href="../../par/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a>), the origin of which is described in <a href="../../par/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1</a>, grew to be a great city covering an area of 225 square reties, reached its highest glory under Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>), and succumbed to the Medo-Persian power under Belshazzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>). The remains of this great city have been discovered on the east bank of the Euphrates near Hillah, where there is a square mound called "Babil" by the Arabs (Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Erech</span>.

Rawlinson does not identify the site; George Smith regards it as "the capital of Sargon, the great city Agadi, near the city of Sippara on the Euphrates, and north of Babylon ('Assyrian Discoveries,' <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And Calneh</span>.

With this the record of Nimrod s achievements closes. It is generally supposed that Nimrod flourished either before or about the time of the building of the tower of Babel; but Prof. Chwolsen of St. Petersburg, in his 'Ueber die Ueberreste der Altbabylon-ischen <span class="accented">Literatur</span>,' brings the dynasty of Nimrod down as late as , relying principally on the evidence of an original work composed by Qut ami, a native Babylonian, and translated by Ibnwa hachijah, a descendant of the Chaldaeans, and assigned by Chwolsen to one of the earlier periods of Babylonian history, in which is mentioned the name of Nemrod, or Nemroda, as the founder of a Canaanite dynasty which ruled at Babylon (vide an excellent paper on this subject in Turner's 'Biblical and Oriental Studies,' Edin., A. and C. Black, 1876). Perhaps the hardest difficulty to explain in connection with the ordinary date assigned to Nimrod is the fact that in <a href="../../par/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, which speaks of the reigning monarchs in the Euphrates valley, there is no account taken of Nineveh and its king - a circumstance which has been supposed to import that the founding of the capital of Assyria could not have been anterior to the days of Abraham. But early Babylonian texts confirm what <a href="../../par/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>. seems to imply - the fact of an Elamite conquest of Babylonia,  <span class="date">B.C. 2280</span>, by Kudur-nanhundi (Kudurlagamar, the Chederlaomer of Genesis), who carried off an image of the goddess Nana from the city Erech (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Assyrian Discoveries,' <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3.), so that this difficulty may be held to have disappeared before the light of archaeological discovery. But at whatever period Nimrod flourished, the Biblical narrative would lead us to anticipate a commingling of Hamitic and Shemitic tongues in the Euphrates valley, which existing monuments confirm (cf. 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 3).

Against the Egyptian origin of the Philistines the possession of a Shemitic tongue and the non-observance of circumcision have been urged; but the first may have been acquired from the conquered Avim whose land they occupied (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-28.htm">Deuteronomy 2:28</a>), and the exodus from Egypt may have taken place prior to the institution of the rite in question. <span class="cmt_word">And Caphtorim.</span> Cappadocia (Bochart), Syrtis Major (Clericus), Crete (Calmer, Ewald), Cyprus (Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller), Coptos, Kouft or Keft, a few miles north of Thebes (Kalisch).
