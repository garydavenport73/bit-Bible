Observe the unselfishness of the apostle's request. He does not ask the Thessalonians to pray specially for himself, but for the unimpeded diffusion and success of the gospel, and for himself only in so far as that he might be freed from all hindrances in preaching the gospel - that God would be pleased to crown his labours with success. That; introducing the subject matter of prayer; what he requested the Thessalonians to pray for. <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord</span> - namely, the gospel - <span class="cmt_word">may have</span> <span class="cmt_word">free course;</span> literally, <span class="accented">may run</span>; that all obstacles to its progress may be removed; that its diffusion may be free and unimpeded; that, like the sun, it may rejoice as a strong man to run his race (<a href="../../par/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/147-15.htm">Psalm 147:15</a>, "He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly"). <span class="cmt_word">And be glorified;</span> namely, in the conversion of souls (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>). The allusion may be to the applause given to the victors in the foot races which constituted so considerable a part of the Grecian games. This personification of the Word of the Lord is a favourite figure with the apostle. "In St. Paul's language there is but a thin film between the Holy Ghost, the Divine personal Spirit, and the spirit in the believer's inmost being. And so in St. Paul's conception there is but a thin film between the Word preached and the living Word of God who is God" (Bishop Alexander). <span class="cmt_word">Even as it is with you;</span> a recognition of the eagerness with which the Thessalonians had received the gospel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all <i>men</i> have not faith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that;</span> a further addition to the prayer. <span class="cmt_word">We</span>; either I Paul, or else Paul and Silas and Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">May be delivered;</span> not may "come off victorious whether by life or death" (Calvin), but may be rescued from our enemies. Jowett observes that we have here the shrinking of the flesh from the dangers which awaited the apostle. But there is no trace of cowardice in these words; the apostle desires deliverance, not for his own sake, but for the sake of the free diffusion of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">From unreasonable;</span> a word whose original meaning is "out of place;" then used in an ethical sense, "wicked," "absurd," "unreasonable;" perhaps here applied to persons who will not listen to arguments. <span class="cmt_word">And wicked men</span>. By these unreasonable and wicked men are not to be understood the Jews of Thessalonica, from whom Paul formerly suffered, for their influence would hardly extend to Corinth; nor Christians who were only so in name (Calvin), and specially the Judaizing Christians, for there is no allusion as vet to their attacks upon the apostle; but the fanatical and unbelieving Jews at Corinth (see <a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all men have not faith;</span> or, <span class="accented">the faith</span>; <span class="accented">the faith is not the possession of all.</span> Faith here is the Christian faith: all men have not received it - obviously alluding to the unbelieving Jews. The words cannot mean, all men have not the true faith - referring to pretended Christians - false brethren, but secret enemies (Calvin). Nor is it to be rendered "all men have not the capacity of faith." Others understand by faith that upright and candid disposition which would  engage men to receive the testimony of the apostle; and others fidelity, as if the apostle meant, "There are few men whom we can trust." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep <i>you</i> from evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; in contrast with the men just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is faithful;</span> as if the apostle had said," Man may be faithless, but the Lord is faithful" (see <a href="../../par/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>). "In contrast to the infidelity of man, he praises the fidelity of God" (Bengel). By the Lord, Christ is meant. In the former Epistle, faithfulness is attributed to God (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>), here to Christ. This faithfulness of Christ consisted in watching over his Church, and in effecting its diffusion in spite of all the opposition of these unreasonable and wicked men. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil;</span> or, <span class="accented">the evil.</span> The word "evil" may be either masculine or neuter: if masculine, then it denotes "the evil one;" if neuter, then "evil" in general. There is nothing in the word itself to determine its meaning; this must be learned from the context. Most commentators (Calvin, Bengel, Olshausen, Hofmann, Macknight, Ellicott, Eadie, and Bishop Alexander) suppose that the evil one is meant; and it is so rendered in the R.V.: "Guard you from the evil one." But it is better to take the word abstractly "evil" in general, whether evil persons or evil things; as a contrast to "every good word and work" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>). So Alford, Lunemann, De Wette, Jowett, Lillie. There is the same difference of opinion with regard to the words in the Lord's Prayer: "Deliver us from evil;" or "from the evil one" (R.V.). Here, also, notwithstanding the high authorities on the opposite side, we consider that our Lord's words are not limited to the evil one, but are to be taken generally - "evil" in the widest sense, as being much more forcible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we have confidence in the Lord.</span> The apostle confidently expects the obedience of the Thessalonians, but his confidence is not fixed on them - on their own efforts, endeavours, and resolutions - but on the Lord, namely, Christ; on his grace and strength communicated to and perfected in weakness. The obedience of the Thessalonians flowed from the grace of Christ; it was in consequence of the communication of the influences of his Spirit that they were enabled to make progress and to persevere in the Christian life. "Here," observes Professor Jowett, "as elsewhere, the apostle speaks of believing, hoping, doing all things in Christ. We lead an ordinary life as well as a religious one; but, with the apostle, his ordinary life is his religious one, and hence he uses religious expressions in reference to all that he says and does." The apostle lives in the sphere of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Touching you;</span> with reference to you - the direction of his confidence. <span class="cmt_word">That ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</span> There is here the same union of Divine assistance and human effort, of God's working and man's working, which pervades the whole scheme of the gospel salvation (see <a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord;</span> namely, Christ, for so the word "Lord" is to be rendered in St. Paul's Epistles. Bishop Wordsworth supposes that the Holy Ghost is here invoiced, as both God and Christ are afterwards mentioned in the petition; but the term "Lord" is not applied by, the apostle to the Holy Ghost; '<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a> is the only apparent exception. <span class="cmt_word">Direct your hearts;</span> as the heart is the fountain of Christian life - the centre of the will. <span class="cmt_word">Into the love of God.</span> Here not God's love to us, specially "the manifestation of the love of God in Christ and his work of redemption" (Olshausen); nor the love of God to man, which is to be the pattern of our love to God; but, objectively, our love to God. This love of God is the fulfilment of the Law; and hence the apostle prays that the Thessalonians may be directed into it as the source and essence of all acceptable obedience. <span class="cmt_word">And into the patient waiting for Christ.</span> The words, "patient waiting," are but one word in the original, generally translated "patience" or "endurance." The clause has been differently interpreted. Some (Calvin, Hofmann, Jowett) render it, as in the A.V., "patient waiting for Christ." And this is conformable to the context, as the object of Paul was to repress all impatient longing for the advent. But such a meaning is not linguistically justifiable. Others render it, "patience for Christ," that is, steadfast endurance for his sake (De Wette); but there is no preposition in the original. The words simply mean "Christ's patience," or "the patience of Christ" (R.V.), the patience which he exhibited under his unparalleled sufferings. The Thessalonians were exposed to persecutions, and therefore the apostle prays that they might be directed into the patience of Christ, as this would enable them to bear all their sufferings with composure. Love and patience comprehend the active and passive virtues of Christianity. Now follows a warning against the disorderly life and conduct which the expectation of the immediate advent of Christ had produced. On account of the supposed nearness of the day of the Lord, great disorders had arisen in the Thessalonian Church. Work had been given up by many, who walked about in fanatical  idleness. The apostle had censured this conduct in his former Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11, 12</a>), but the evil had rather increased than diminished; and, accordingly, he severely rebukes this spirit, and sets himself to correct the disorders occasioned by it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now we command you, brethren.</span> An injunction, not specially directed to the elders or office bearers, but to the members, of the Church in general (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Strengthening the command, as being given in the Name and authority of the great Head of the Church; not we, but Christ himself commands you. <span class="cmt_word">That ye withdraw yourselves.</span> A nautical expression, denoting to "shorten the sails;" hence metaphorically to keep out of the way, to withdraw; that ye avoid intercourse and fellowship with; no allusion as yet to excommunication. <span class="cmt_word">From every brother</span> - follow Christian - <span class="cmt_word">that walketh disorderly;</span> literally, <span class="accented">out of the ranks</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And not after the tradition;</span> or, <span class="accented">the instructions</span>; not the example of the apostle, which is afterwards mentioned, but the instructions which he orally delivered when at Thessalonica, and subsequently confirmed by the Epistle which he had written to them (see <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which he received of us.</span> Here the readings of manuscripts differ.

Paul, as an apostle, had the right of maintenance from the Churches among whom he laboured. This right of support he insists upon in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-18</a>). But for the sake of his converts, to give them an example of diligent working, and to remove every impediment to the progress of the gospel, he often waived his rights. Thus he did at Thessalonica (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6, 9</a>), at Corinth (<a href="../../par/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>), and at Ephesus (Acts 20:340; in all these places he laboured for his maintenance as a tent maker. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - we acted so - <span class="cmt_word">to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow</span> - imitate - <span class="cmt_word">us</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a></div><div class="verse">For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For even when we were with you;</span> during our residence in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">This we commanded, that if any man would not work, neither should he eat.</span> This or similar expressions have been shown to be a proverb in frequent use among the Jews. Thus: "Whoever doth not work doth not eat" ('Bereshith Rabba'); "Let not him who would not labour before the sabbath eat on the sabbath" ('In Lib. Zenon.'). It is a law of nature, and the apostle here sanctions it as a law of Christianity. There is here a reference to the sentence pronounced on man in Paradise in consequence of disobedience: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). Labour, indeed, may in one point of view be considered as part of the curse, but it is also a blessing adapted to man's fallen nature. Labour is the law of God; idleness is the parent of many crimes and is productive of misery. He who has no business allotted to him ought to choose some useful occupation for himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a></div><div class="verse">For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; the reason for the allusion to this proverb. <span class="cmt_word">We hear.</span> The apostle had either heard from Timothy who had rejoined him from Thessalonica, or from the report of the bearers of the First Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">That there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</span> There is here a paranomasia or play upon words, the words "working" and "busybodies" being cognate. It is difficult to preserve the resemblance in a translation. "Busy only with what is not their own business" (Jowett); "Working at no business, but being busybodies" (Ellicott); "Not busy, but busybodies" (Wordsworth). The word "busybodies" denotes busy in useless and superfluous things, about which one need not trouble himself - occupied about trifles. The apostle refers to the fanatical excitement in the Church on account of which the Thessalonians, instead of occupying themselves with the fulfilment of the duties of their earthly calling, busied themselves about matters which were unprofitable and vain. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now them that are such we command and exhort by</span> (or, as the best manuscripts read, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">our Lord Jesus</span>  <span class="cmt_word">Christ</span>; in him, as the source of authority; "In his Name." <span class="cmt_word">That with quietness.</span> In contrast to being busybodies, with calmness of spirit, freedom from excitement. <span class="cmt_word">They work, and eat their own bread;</span> not the bread of others, but their own, for which they have laboured and which they have earned. They would thus be independent of the liberality and generosity of others. (For similar exhortations, see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a></div><div class="verse">But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye, brethren;</span> contrasted with those who walk disorderly, ye who have not neglected your worldly employments. <span class="cmt_word">Be not weary in well doing;</span> or, as it is in the margin, <span class="accented">faint not in well doing</span>; "lose not heart in well doing" (Ellicott). The phrase has been differently interpreted. Thus Chrysostom explains it that indolent persons, however justly they may be condemned, must not be suffered to perish from want - a meaning opposed to the context. Calvin renders it that, although there are many that are undeserving and abuse our liberality, we must not on this account leave off helping those who need our aid: let not the sloth of those disorderly persons hinder or damp your charity - a most needful admonition, but it does not exhaust all that is meant by the precept. Others restrict it to diligence in our earthly duties: though others be idle, working not at all, let not their example lead you astray; be not ye weary in doing what is right and proper (Lunemann). But the phrase is to be understood in its general sense, denoting holy and upright conduct (see <a href="../../par/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, where the same exhortation is given). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any man obey not our word by this Epistle, note that man.</span> Some attach the words, "by this Epistle," to" note that man," and render the clause, "Note that man by an epistle to me." Thus Calvin: "He desires that they may be reported to him, that he may reprove them by his authority." So also in the margin of our A.V.: "Signify that man by an epistle." But the presence of the article denoting a definite Epistle, "this Epistle," and the order of the words in the Greek, are against this interpretation. Others render the clause, "Note that man by this Epistle;" point out to him the injunctions and the warnings which are contained in it against such a line of conduct; but such a meaning is too artificial. It is better, therefore, to attach the words, "by this Epistle," to "our word," as in the A.V.: "If any man obey not our word by this Epistle." "Note that man;" that is, set a mark upon him, note him for the sake of avoidance, excommunicate him from your society. And have no company with him. Exclude him from your fellowship meetings, your love feasts. <span class="cmt_word">That he may be ashamed;</span> the design or object of thus noting him. As if the apostle had said, "Bring the force of Christian opinion to bear upon him. Show your moral indignation by excluding him from the Christian community." The noting or excommunicating was more of the nature of a correction than of a punishment, and its design was the reclaiming of the offender. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Yet count <i>him</i> not as an enemy, but admonish <i>him</i> as a brother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span>; or as it is in the original, <span class="accented">and</span>; a purely connective particle. <span class="cmt_word">Count him not as an enemy;</span> an entire outcast. <span class="cmt_word">But admonish him as a brother;</span> a Christian brother. No hostile feeling was to be united with this avoidance of intercourse with the erring, but rather loving admonition, inasmuch as he was still a Christian brother.

Pease is here to be taken in its widest sense - peace with God, complete salvation. <span class="cmt_word">Give you peace always by all means</span>. Some manuscripts read "in every place," but the reading in our version is best attested - "always by all means;" "at all times and in every way;" whether it be outward or inward, for time or for eternity.

Thus Tertius was his amanuensis when he wrote the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="../../par/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a>). Probably the Epistle to the Galatians is an exception (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a>), and also the Epistle to Philemon on (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>). The same authentication expressed in the same words is found in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-21.htm">1 Corinthians 16:21</a>), and in the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span>; referring, not to the salutation, but to the whole clause; which circumstance. <span class="cmt_word">Is the token;</span> the mark of authentication. <span class="cmt_word">Of every Epistle.</span> Such authentication was especially necessary in the case of the Thessalonians, as it would seem that a forged epistle had been circulated among them (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). Some restrict the words to the Epistles which the apostle would afterwards write to the Thessalonians (Lunemann); but they are rather to be understood of a caution which the apostle practised, or was to practise, in all his Epistles. Some refer the token to the words, "The salutation of Paul with mine own hand," and although these words are only found in two other Epistles, yet it is asserted that the  other Epistles were otherwise sufficiently authenticated. But it appears better to understand by the salutation the benediction which follows; and a similar salutation or benediction is found at the close of all Paul's Epistles (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-28.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:28</a>).
