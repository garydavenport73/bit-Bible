The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> is repeated with Geshem, but not with Tobiah, probably because Tobiah was Sanballat's subordinate, but Geshem an independent chief. Hence, too, it was not proposed that Tobiah should be at the conference. <span class="cmt_word">At that time I had not set up the doors</span>. This may appear to contradict <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1, 3, 6, 13</a>, etc. But the account of the building in ch. 3. is carried on to the completion of the whole work, the object there being to state by whom the different parts were done, and not at what time. Chronologically, chs. 4, 5, and 6. are parallel to ch. 3, relating events that happened while the wall was being built. The hanging of the doors in the gateways was, naturally, the last thing done. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the gates</span>. Rather, "in the gateways."

The Hebrew has "in the villages," which seems too vague. Bertheau therefore suggests, "in Hakkiphirim," taking the word as the name of a particular village, which is probably right. <span class="cmt_word">Ono</span> was near Lydda, in the plain country bordering on Philistia<span class="cmt_word">.

Letters in the East are usually placed in silken bags, which are then tied up and carefully sealed. An "open letter" invited perusal; and the object of sending this one "open' must have been to create alarm among the Jews, and to excite them against Nehemiah. Compare the conduct of Sennacherib's ambassadors (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-27.htm">2 Kings 18:27-33</a>).

Rather, "<span class="accented">sought</span> to affright us." Their attempts did not succeed. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands</span>. "O God" is not in the original; whence some critics do not see in the words used a prayer, but only a statement - "But I now strengthened my hands" (so the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions). This meaning, however, cannot be obtained from the present text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-10.htm">Nehemiah 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <i>was</i> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - A <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> appears in the list of priests who afterwards signed the covenant (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-8.htm">Nehemiah 10:8</a>); but the names in that list do not appear to be personal. There is a Shemaiah also among the priests who took part in the dedication of the wall (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-42.htm">Nehemiah 12:42</a>); he is not said, however, to be "the son of Delaiah." <span class="cmt_word">Shut up</span>. Prevented, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by some legal impurity from taking part in the temple service, or even entering the temple. <span class="cmt_word">In the house of God, within the temple</span>. Rather, "within the <span class="accented">sanctuary."</span> The <span class="accented">heykal</span> was the same as the holy place, and meant that part of the temple building which intervened between the porch and the holy of holies. It corresponded, as Gesenius observes, to the body or nave of modern cathedrals. <span class="cmt_word">Let us shut the doors.</span> Folding doors of fir wood separated the holy place from the porch in the temple of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-34.htm">1 Kings 6:34</a>); and these had no doubt their counterpart in the restored temple. Shemaiah suggested the shutting of these doors for greater security 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-11.htm">Nehemiah 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <i>is there</i>, that, <i>being</i> as I <i>am</i>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Should such a man as I flee?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Should a man in my position, the head of the state, bound to set an example to others, fly from danger and hide myself? Surely not. <span class="cmt_word">And who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life?</span> Rather, "could go into the temple and live?" Dean Stanley compares Becket's noble words, - "I will not turn the cathedral into a castle," - but the parallel is not close. Nehemiah feels, not that he would profane the temple by making it into a place of refuge, but that he would break the law by simply entering it. Ewald shows that he has caught the point of the objection when he says, "Nehemiah thought that, as a <span class="accented">layman</span>, he must not break the Divine command by entering the sanctuary itself" ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 157). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-12.htm">Nehemiah 6:12</a></div><div class="verse">And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, I perceived</span>, etc. Rather, "And I considered; and lo! God had not sent him." I reflected on the whole matter, and came to the conclusion that, though he might be a prophet, he had not on this occasion exercised his prophetical office - he had not declared to me God's will (compare the case of the "old prophet," <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11-18</a>). And I was right, "for (in fact) he had <span class="cmt_word">pronounced this prophecy against me,</span> because <span class="cmt_word">Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him</span>." "Tobiah and Sanballat" here - not "Sanballat and Tobiah," as elsewhere (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a>), because Tobiah was no doubt the immediate briber, Sanballat merely furnishing the funds. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-13.htm">Nehemiah 6:13</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore <i>was</i> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <i>that</i> they might have <i>matter</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore was he hired</span>, etc. Their motive for bribing him was, that I might be induced by-fear to do as Shemaiah suggested, and so to commit sin; whereby they would have a just ground for spreading <span class="cmt_word">an evil report</span> concerning me, and making my misconduct a constant reproach to me. Nehemiah's influence depended greatly on the weight of his moral character. One false step, and he would have been lost; his influence would have been gone; and the work on which his heart was set would have come to nought. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">Tobiah and Sanballat</span>. See ver. 12, with the comment<span class="cmt_word">. The prophetess Noadiah</span> is not elsewhere mentioned. She has been supposed to have succumbed to a bribe, like Shemaiah (Ewald); but this is wholly uncertain. We only know that, together with certain <span class="accented">soi-disant</span> prophets, she endeavoured to "put Nehemiah in fear." It is clear that she was unsuccessful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day</i> of <i>the month</i> Elul, in fifty and two days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days</span>. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:5, &sect; 8), the work of restoration occupied two years and four months, or 840 days, instead of fifty-two. And this period has been thought so much more probable than the smaller one, that moderns generally have accepted it, while some have even proposed to alter our present text of Nehemiah by the insertion of <span class="accented">u-shnathayim</span>, "and two years," at the end of this verse (Ewald). But the authority of Josephus on matters of remote history is so small, and the whole account of Nehemiah is so harmonious and consistent with itself, that alteration seems quite unnecessary. Nehemiah leaves Susa in Nisan, probably towards the middle or close of the month, for his preparations must have taken him some time. He would be likely to be nearly three months on his journey, and would thus reach Jerusalem about the middle of July - say July 15. He then rested three days, surveyed the wall, laid his plan before the nobles, arranged the working parties, and set to work. It was his object to hasten matters as much as possible; and he may well have commenced the rebuilding within ten days of his arrival. Fifty-two days from July 25 would bring him to Sept. 15, which corresponds, as nearly as may be, to the 25th of Elul. There is no difficulty in supposing that the wall could have been repaired in this space. The materials were ready at hand; the working parties were numerous; the workmen full of zeal. If we estimate the circumference of the wall at four miles, which is probably beyond the truth, and the working parties at forty-two (Ewald), it will follow that each party had, on the average, to repair 168 yards, or at the rate of between three and four yards a day. There was probably no work done on the sabbaths, and there may have been one or two days of interruption, when attack seemed imminent (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-15</a>); but otherwise the work was carried on without pause from early dawn to dark (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 21). The wall attained to half its height in a very short time (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 6), - there was then a brief interruption,  - after which came the main work of completing the entire circuit to its full height. It is possible that the fifty-two days are counted from the "return to work (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 15). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-16.htm">Nehemiah 6:16</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <i>thereof</i>, and all the heathen that <i>were</i> about us saw <i>these things</i>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our enemies</span>. The Samaritans, the Ammonites, the Ashdodites, and the Arabians under Oeshem are the special "enemies" here spoken cf. The Phoenicians, Syrians, Moabites, etc. are the other "heathen round about" the Jews. Even these last were unfriendly, and disliked any increase of Jewish power and prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">They perceived that this work was wrought of our God</span>. They could not but recognise a special Providence as befriending and protecting the Jews, who, after having been utterly crushed and rooted out by Nebuchadnezzar, were now re-established in a commanding position in Palestine, and allowed to make their city once more an almost impregnable fortress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <i>the letters</i> of Tobiah came unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>Moreover in those days</span>. Ewald supposes that the circumstances here related (vers. 17-19) were subsequent to the completion of the wall ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 157); but the expression "in those days" seems rather to throw back the events into the time during which the wall was in building. The passage is a sort of explanatory note, showing us how Tobiah came to be able to raise those intrigues inside Jerusalem which have been mentioned in vers. 12-14. <span class="cmt_word">And the letters of Tobiah came unto them</span>. Rather, "and many were the letters of Tobiah which came to them."
