The porters and the singers were themselves Levites, but are often distinguished from their brethren, who had no such special office (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40-42, 70</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/7-24.htm">Ezra 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-43.htm">Nehemiah 7:43-45, 73</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-28.htm">Nehemiah 10:28</a>, etc.). Nehemiah's choice of Levites to guard the gates of Jerusalem may seem strange; but we must remember - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the priests and Levites formed nearly one half the population of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-6.htm">Nehemiah 11:6-19</a> compared with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-9.htm">1 Chronicles 9:9-22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the office of guarding the temple gates had always been discharged by Levites (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17-22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12-19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-2.htm">Nehemiah 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he <i>was</i> a faithful man, and feared God above many.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hanani and Hananiah</span>. This appointment of two municipal officers to have charge of Jerusalem recalls the mention of two "rulers" in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-9.htm">Nehemiah 3:9, 12</a>, each of whom had authority-over half the district dependent on Jerusalem, and amounts to an "undesigned coincidence." <span class="cmt_word">The ruler of the palace</span>. Rather, "the commandant of the fort," <span class="cmt_word">i.e.</span> the officer in charge of the temple fortress (see above, <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-3.htm">Nehemiah 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar <i>them</i>: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one <i>to be</i> over against his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not the gates be opened until the sun be hot</span>. The gates of towns in the East are usually opened at sunrise; but this cannot be the intention here. Some extra precaution is signified - not, however, so much as Dathe supposes, who renders <span class="accented">ante tempus meridianum</span>, "before noon;" but rather something intermediate between this and the ordinary practice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-4.htm">Nehemiah 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">Now the city <i>was</i> large and great: but the people <i>were</i> few therein, and the houses <i>were</i> not builded.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The city was large</span>. Literally, "broad every way<span class="cmt_word">." The houses were not builded</span>. Much of the city consisted of open spaces, in which no houses had been as yet built. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles</span>, etc. As Nehemiah contemplated the vast empty spaces within the city walls, and considered with himself how they might best be peopled, the thought came to him - and he hailed it as a Divine inspiration - that by taking a census of the people he might pave the way for some transfer of the inhabitants of the country districts into the capital, which would at any rate strengthen the latter, and lessen the desolate appearance of its streets and squares, which had so pained him. The census would show what proportion the country and town populations bore to each other, and would point out which were the places in the country districts that could best afford to lose a portion of their inhabitants. A census, therefore was resolved upon, and, according to ordinary Jewish usage (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17-47</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-62</a>), it was genealogical. The tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi were numbered separately (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-4.htm">Nehemiah 11:4-19</a>); and in the tribe of Judah the children of Pharez were reckoned apart from those of Zerah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-4.htm">1 Chronicles 9:4, 6</a>). No doubt the genealogical principle was acted upon throughout, but further evidence upon the point is wanting. It would seem to have been in the course of his preparations for this census, perhaps in searching for precedents, that Nehemiah found the "register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first," which is the subject of the next section. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 7:6-73 THE REGISTER OF THOSE WHO RETURNED UNDER ZERUBBABEL, WITH THE NUMBER OF THEIR SLAVES, BEASTS, AND OBLATIONS (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6-73</a>). It is no doubt a curious circumstance that this list should occur twice, with no important differences, in the two Books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Perhaps it was not in the original Ezra, that writer not having had the good fortune to "<span class="accented">find"</span> the document; but Nehemiah having "found" it and inserted it here, in connection with its discovery, a later arranger (Malachi?) removed it to the early part of Ezra, because it belonged to that portion of the Jewish history chronologically. The double record enables us to make out a more perfect catalogue than we could have obtained from either separately,-since there are corruptions in each which may be corrected by means of the other. See the comment which follows.

It makes against the view of Bishop Patrick and others, who regard Ezra's list as made at Babylon, some time before the final departure, and Nehemiah's as made at Jerusalem, after the arrival of the exiles, that the sum total is in each case the same (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>). Bishop Kennicott's theory, that the three lists - that of Ezra, that of Nehemiah, and that in the first of Esdras - had all one original, and that the existing differences proceed entirely from mistakes of the copyists, is the only tenable one. It is especially remarkable that the differences in the numbers of the three lists consist chiefly <span class="accented">in a single unit, a single ten, or a single hundred</span> - or in a five; less often in two units, or two tens, or two hundreds, or in a six - differences probably arising from the obliteration of one or two signs in a notation resembling the Roman or the Egyptian, where there are special signs for a thousand, a hundred, ten, five, and the unit, complex numbers being expressed by repetition of these, as 3438 in Latin inscriptions by MMMCCCCXXXVIII. Any fading of a sign in such a notation as this causes a copyist to diminish the amount by one, five, ten, a hundred, a thousand, etc. A fading of two sigmas may produce a diminution of two thousand, two hundred, twenty, two; or again of eleven hundred, one hundred and ten, one hundred and five, fifteen, eleven, six, and the like.

Ezra says 200; but this must be a round number. 1 Esdras confirms Nehemiah (Nehemiah 5:42).

The apocryphal Esdras has an enormous and most improbable augmentation of the number of the horses (7036 for 736).

This is additional to the information contained in Ezra, who does not separate Zerubbabel's offering from that of the other heads of families (Nehemiah 2:69). The account of the oblations is altogether more exact in Nehemiah than in the earlier historian. For the value of the contributions made, see the comment on Ezra (1.s.c.).

The document found by Nehemiah (ver. 5) probably ended with these words (romp. <a href="../../par/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>); and ch. 7. should here terminate, as it does in the Septuagint. Having completed the account of what happened in the sixth month, Elul (ch. 6:15), and transcribed the register which he had the good fortune to discover at that date, Nehemiah proceeds to relate events belonging to the seventh month. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../nehemiah/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Nehemiah 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nehemiah/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nehemiah 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
