Jerusalem was the residence of all the nobles from the first (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a>); no increase could be made in this element of the population. Nehemiah had to look lower, and to obtain his new settlers from the ranks of the "people." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The people ... cast lots.</span> No doubt under direction. The Jews had frequent recourse to the lot for the determining of doubtful matters, believing, as they did, that "the whole disposing thereof was of the Lord (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Divine sanction had been given, in  the course of the Jewish history, to the use  of the lot for the selection of persons (Joshua 7:16-18 <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19-21</a>), for the distribution of lands (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-25.htm">Numbers 26:25, 26</a>), and  for the determination of the order in which  different bodies should execute an office  (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>). In the democratic states of Greece it was used widely to determine between candidates for an office. One in ten. Ewald supposes that this was to be the proportion between the population of Jerusalem and the whole population of the country, and ascribes the fixing of the proportion to Zerubbabel ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 159). But there is no statement to this effect in either Ezra or Nehemiah, and the brief narrative of this verse seems to imply the addition of a tenth part of the country population to the previous population of Jerusalem, rather than the establishment of any definite proportion between the two. Nine parts. Literally, "nine <span class="accented">hands</span>," as in <a href="../../par/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/47-24.htm">Genesis 47:24</a>.

The people called down blessings upon them for their patriotism.

A comparison is in the writer's mind between the Jews of Palestine and those of the great Persian capitals, Babylon and Susa, to which, as a Persian official, he himself properly belongs.

It follows that those who removed from the country districts to Jerusalem quitted their "possessions, often, it may be, exchanging riches for poverty, a comfortable house for one half in ruins (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-4.htm">Nehemiah 7:4</a>), and the life of a small landed proprietor for that of an artisan or hired labourer. Hence the "blessings" called down by the people on those who volunteered (ver. 2). Israel. Compare <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a>, where we find that among those who had returned were mere-bers of the two great Israelitish tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim.

The writer here passes from personal to famfiy names. Jedaiah and Joiarib were two of the chief priestly families, and are usually mentioned together (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-6.htm">Nehemiah 12:6, 19</a>, etc.).

Zanoah was not a place of any importance, but Adullam, near which was David's cave, is often mentioned. It had its own king in the time of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>), and remained a city of some strength under the Maccabees (2 Macc. 12:38). <span class="cmt_word">Lachish</span> is a place even more celebrated than Adullam.

Amaziah took refuge there when conspiracy threatened him at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>); and Sennacherib "besieged it with all his power" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-9.htm">2 Chronicles 22:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Azekah</span> is joined with Jarmuth and Adullam in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>.

Its proximity to <span class="cmt_word">Michmash and Aija</span> (Aiath) appears in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>. All three places were in the near vicinity of Bethel.

It was famous for the massacre of the priests by Doeg (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18, 19</a>). Ananiah is mentioned only in this place.
