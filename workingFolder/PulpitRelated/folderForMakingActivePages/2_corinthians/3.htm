He anticipates the malignant and meaning smiles with which they would hear such words. The word "again" implies that this charge had already been brought against him, perhaps in consequence of such passages as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-18.htm">1 Corinthians 14:18</a>, etc. Such passages might be called self-laudatory and egotistical, were it not that (as St. Paul here explains) they arose only from a sense of the grandeur of his office, of which he was the almost involuntary agent, used by God as it seemed best to him. Hence he says later on (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7.htm">2 Corinthians 7</a>:18) that self-praise is no commendation, and that the true test of a man is God's commendation. The verb "I commend," technically used in the same sense as our "commendatory letters," occurs also in <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or need we,</span> etc.? The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, thus translated, is better supported than <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, unless, which would have a somewhat ironical force. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the reading <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> implies, "Can you possibly think that we need," etc.? Generally, when a stranger came to some Church to which he was not personally known, he carried with him some credentials in the form of letters from accredited authorities. St. Paul treats it as absurd to suppose that he or Timothy should need such letters, either <span class="accented">from</span> the Corinthians or to them. <span class="cmt_word">As some</span>. He will not name them, but he refers to the Judaists, who vaunted of their credentials in order to disparage St. Paul, who was too great to need and too independent to use them. We can hardly, perhaps, realize the depth and bitterness of antagonism concealed under that word "some" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18</a> <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>. It is not meant that there was anything discreditable in using such letters (for Apollos had used them, <a href="../../par/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>), but the disgraceful thing was that St. Paul should be disparaged for not bringing them. <span class="cmt_word">Epistles of commendation.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "introductory letters" - was familiar in later Greek. In days when there were few public hostels, and when it was both a duty and a necessity for small and persecuted communities like those of the Jews and Christians to practise hospitality (<a href="../../par/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>. etc.), it was customary both for synagogues and Churches to provide their friends and emissaries with authentic testimonials. Otherwise they might have been deceived by wandering impostors, as, in fact, the Christians were deceived by the vagabond quack Peregrinus. We can easily see how the custom of using such letters might be abused by idle, restless, and intriguing persons, who have never found it very difficult to procure them. We find traces of their <span class="accented">honest</span> use by Phoebe, by Silas and Jude, by Apollos, by Mark, and by Zenas, in <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; and of their unfair use by certain Judaists, in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> and Galatians 2:12. Nothing can more forcibly illustrate the necessity for St. Paul's protest against the idle vaunt of possessing such letters, than the fact that, <span class="accented">more than a century afterwards</span>, we find malignant innuendoes aimed at St. Paul in the pseudo-Clementines, under the name of" the enemy" and "Simon Magus" and "a deceiver." He is there spoken of as using letters from the high priest (which, indeed, St. Paul had done as Saul of Tarsus, <a href="../../par/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1, 2</a>); and the Churches are warned never to receive any one who cannot bring credentials from James; so deep-rooted among the Judaists was the antagonism to the independent apostolate and daring originality of the apostle of the Gentiles! Dr. Plumptre quotes Sozomen ('H.E.', 5:16) for the curious fact that the Emperor Julian tried to introduce the system of "commendatory letters" into his revived paganism. <span class="cmt_word">Or letters of commendation from you.</span> The substitution of "letters" for "epistles" is an instance of the almost childish fondness for unnecessary synonyms, which is one of the defects of the Authorized Version. The true reading probably is "to you or from you" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C). The word "commendatory" (<span class="accented">sustatikon</span>) is omitted in A, B, C. <span class="accented">Or from you</span>. It was worse than absurd to suppose that St. Paul should need those <span class="accented">literae formatae</span> to a Church of which he was the thunder; and nothing but the boundless "inflation" which characterized the Corinthians could have led them to imagine that he needed letters <span class="accented">from</span> them to other Churches, as though, forsooth, they were the primary Church or the only church (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-36.htm">1 Corinthians 14:36</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are our epistle.</span> Their very existence as a Church was the most absolute "commendatory letter" of St. Paul, both <span class="accented">from</span> them and <span class="accented">to</span> them (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-2.htm">1 Corinthians 9:2</a>, "The seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord "). <span class="cmt_word">Written in our hearts.</span> The expression has no connection with the fact that the high priest bore the names of Israel graven on the jewelled Urim, which he wore upon his breast. St. Paul means that others may bring their "letters of commendation" in their hands. <span class="accented">His</span> letter of commendation is the very name and existence of the Church of Corinth written on his heart. <span class="cmt_word">Known and read of all men.</span> The metaphor is subordinated to the <span class="accented">fact</span>. All men may recognize the autograph, and in it were read the history of the Corinthian  converts, which was written on the apostle's heart, and which therefore rendered the notion of any other letter of commendation to or from them superfluous and even absurd. The play on words (<span class="accented">epigignosko</span> and <span class="accented">anagignosko</span>) is similar to that in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">2 Corinthians 1:13</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Forasmuch as ye are</i> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Manifestly declared.</span> The fame and centrality of Corinth gave peculiar prominence to the fact of their conversion. <span class="cmt_word">The epistle of Christ ministered by us.</span> The Corinthians are the epistle; it is written on the hearts of St. Paul and his companions; Christ was its Composer; they were its amanuenses and its conveyers. The development of the metaphor <span class="accented">as a metaphor</span> would be somewhat clumsy and intricate, but St. Paul only cares to shadow forth the essential fact which he wishes them to recognize. Not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not with visible or perishable materials, but spiritual in its origin and character. The notion of "the finger of God" naturally recalled the notion of "the Spirit of God" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a> with <a href="../../par/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>). Not in tables of stone. God's writing by means of the Spirit on the heart reminds him of another writing <span class="accented">of God</span> on the stone tablets of the Law, which he therefore introduces with no special regard to the congruity of the metaphor about "an epistle." <span class="cmt_word">But in fleshy tables of the heart.</span> The overwhelming preponderance of manuscript authority supports the reading "but in fleshen tablets - hearts." St. Paul is thinking of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, "I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;" and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>, "I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh." The tablets were not hard and fragile, but susceptible and receptive. Our letters of introduction are inward not outward, spiritual not material, permanent not perishable, legible to all not only by a few, written by Christ not by man.

The "new testament" has not the remotest connection with what we call "The New Testament," meaning thereby the book - which, indeed, had at this time no existence. The word "testament" means a will, and in this sense implies neither the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span> nor the Greek <span class="accented">diatheke</span>, both of which mean "covenant." In one passage only of the New Testament (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16, 17</a>) does <span class="accented">diatheke</span> mean a "testament" or "will." For the thought, see <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11, 12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Not of the letter, but of the spirit.</span> In other words, "not of the Law, but of the gospel;" not of that which is dead, but of that which is living; not of that which is deathful, but of that which is life-giving; not of bondage, but of freedom; not of mutilation, but of self-control; not of the outward, but of the inward; not of works, but of grace; not of menace, but of promise; not of curse, but of blessing; not of wrath, but of love; not of Moses, but of Christ. This is the theme which St. Paul develops especially in the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians (see <a href="../../par/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Not of the letter</span>. Not, that is, of the Mosaic Law regarded as a yoke of externalism; a hard and unhelpful "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not;" a system that possessed no life of its own and inspired no life into others; a "categoric imperative," majestic, indeed, but unsympathetic and pitiless. Both the Law and the gospel were <span class="accented">committed to writing</span>; each covenant had its own <span class="accented">book</span>; but in the case of the Mosaic Law there was the book and nothing more; in the case of the gospel the book was nothing compared to the spirit, and nothing without the spirit. <span class="accented">Out of the spirit</span>. That is, of the gospel which found its pledge and consummation in the gift of the Spirit. The Law, too, was in one sense "spiritual" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>), for it was given by God, who is a Spirit, and it was a holy Law; but though such in itself (<span class="accented">in se</span>) it was relatively (<span class="accented">per aceidens</span>) a cause of sin and death, because it was addressed to a fallen nature, and inspired no spirit by which that nature could be delivered (see  <a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-25</a>). But in the gospel the spirit is everything; the mere letter is as nothing (<a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span> This is one of the very numerous "texts" which have been first misinterpreted and have then been made, for whole centuries, the bases of erroneous systems. On this text more than any other, Origen, followed by the exegetes of a thousand years, built his dogma that the Scripture must be interpreted allegorically, not literally, because "the letter" of the Bible kills. The misinterpretation is extravagantly inexcusable, and, like many others, arose solely from rending words away from their context and so reading new senses into them. The contrast is not between "the outward" and the inward sense of Scripture at all. "The letter" refers exclusively to "the Law," and therefore has so little reference to "the Bible" that it was written before most of the New Testament existed, and only touches on a small portion of the Old Testament. <span class="accented">Killeth</span>. Two questions arise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">What</span> and <span class="accented">whom</span> does it <span class="accented">kill?</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">how</span> does it <span class="accented">kill?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The answers seem to be that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the letter - the Law regarded as an outward letter - passes the sentence of <span class="accented">death on those who disobey it</span>. It says, "He who doeth these things shall live in them;" and therefore implies, as well as often says, that he who disobeys them shall be cut off. It is, therefore, a deathful menace. For none <span class="accented">can</span> obey this Law with perfect obedience. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sting of death being sin, the Law kills by directly leading to sin, in that it stirs into existence the principle of concupiscence (<a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10, 21</a>). <span class="accented">But the spirit giveth life</span>. This contrast between a dead and a living covenant is fundamental, and especially in the writings of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27-29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-8.htm">Galatians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The Law stones the adulteress; the gospel says to her, "Go, and sin no more." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">But if the ministration of death, written <i>and</i> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <i>glory</i> was to be done away:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ministration of death.</span> The ministration, that is, of the Law, of "the letter which killeth." St. Paul here begins one of the arguments <span class="accented">a minori ad majus</span> which are the very basis of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <span class="cmt_word">Written and engraven in stones;</span> literally, <span class="accented">engraved in letters on stones</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). The reference shows that, in speaking of "the letter," St. Paul was only thinking of the Mosaic Law, and indeed specifically of the Decalogue. <span class="cmt_word">Was glorious;</span> literally, <span class="accented">occurred in glory</span>, or, <span class="accented">proved itself glorious</span>. In itself the Law was "holy, just, and good" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), and given "at the disposition of angels" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>); and its transitory glory was illustrated by the lustre which the face of Moses caught by reflection from his intercourse with God (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). St. Paul has been led quite incidentally into this digression in the course of defending himself by describing the nature of his ministry; but it bore very definitely on his general purpose, because his chief opponents were Judaists, whose one aim it was to bind upon the Church the yoke of Mosaism. That they could not "behold" the face of Moses is the <span class="accented">hagadah</span>, or traditional legend, derived from <a href="../../par/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a>, which says that "they were afraid to <span class="accented">draw nigh</span> to him. The reader may recall the beautiful lines of Cardinal Newman- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Lord l grant me this abiding grace -<br />Thy words and saints to know;<br />To pierce the veil on Moses' face,<br />Although his words be slow."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Because of the glory of his countenance.</span> This circumstance is so often alluded to as to have become identified with the conception of Moses. The Hebrew words for "a ray of light" and "a horn" are identical; hence, instead of saying that his face was "irradiated," the Vulgate says, <span class="accented">Cornnta erat ejus facies</span>; and even in our version of <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a> we find "And he had <span class="accented">horns</span> [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. 'rays of light'] coming out of his hand." To this is due the mediaeval symbol of Moses with horns, as in the matchless statue by Michael Angelo. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory was to be done away.</span> The Greek might be expressed by "the glory - the evanescing glory  - of his countenance." It was not "to <span class="accented">be</span> done away," but from the first moment they saw it it began to vanish. The verb "to do away," implying annulment, and the being abrogated as invalid, is a characteristic word in this group cf Epistles, in which it occurs twenty-two times. This illustrates the prominence in St. Paul's thoughts of the fact that the Law was now "antiquated" and "near its obliteration" (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). But in dwelling on the brief and transient character of this radiance, St. Paul seizes on a point which (naturally) is not dwelt upon in <a href="../../par/exodus/34.htm">Exodus 34</a>.

In other words, the glory of Mosaism is so completely outdazzled by the splendour of the gospel, that, relatively speaking, it has no glory left; the moon and the stars cease to shine, they "pale their ineffectual fires" when the sun is in the zenith. The phrase, "in this respect," occurs again in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-3.htm">2 Corinthians 9:3</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>.

And here the image of "the veil" as completely seizes St. Paul's imagination as the image of the letter does in the first verses. <span class="cmt_word">Put a veil;</span> literally, <span class="accented">was putting</span>, or, <span class="accented">used to put</span>, a veil on his face when he had finished speaking to the people. <span class="cmt_word">That the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that the children of Israel might not gaze on the end of what was passing away</span>. The object of the veil, according to St. Paul, was to prevent the Israelites from gazing on <span class="accented">the last gleam of the covenant</span>. In other words, he did not wish them to be witnesses of a <span class="accented">fading</span> glory. It is preposterous to imagine that St. Paul is here casting any blame on the conduct of Moses, as though he acted fraudulently or delusively. Moses was aware, and even told the people, float his legislation was not final (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15 -19</a>), but it would be quite natural that he should not wish the people to witness the gradual dimming of the lustre which, in St. Paul's view, was typical of that transitoriness. It seems, however, that St. Paul is here either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> following a different reading or rendering of <a href="../../par/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a>; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is adopting some Jewish <span class="accented">hagadah</span>; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is giving his own turn to the narrative, as the rabbis habitually did, by way of <span class="accented">midrash</span>, or exposition. For from the narrative of Exodus we should not gather that it was the object of Moses to hide the disappearance of the splendour, but rather to render the light endurable. In our Authorized Version the verse runs, "till Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face;" but the meaning of the original may be, "after he had done speaking with them," as the LXX. takes it and the Vulgate. <span class="accented">The end</span>. To interpret this of <span class="accented">Christ</span>, because of <a href="../../par/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>, is an instance of the superstitious and unintelligent way in which systems are made out of a mosaic of broken texts. The foolish character of the interpretation is shown when we consider that it involves the inference that Moses put a veil on his face in order to prevent the Israelites from seeing Christi But this attempt to illustrate Scripture by catching at a similar, expression applied in a wholly different way in another part of Scripture, is one of the normal follies of scriptural interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <i>vail</i> is done away in Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their minds</span>.

It means that their powers of reason were, so to speak, petrified. <span class="cmt_word">Were blinded;</span> rather, <span class="accented">were hardened</span>. The verb cannot mean" to blind." By whom were their minds hardened? It would be equally correct to say by themselves (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8</a>), or by Satan (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), or by God (<a href="../../par/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The same veil.</span> Of course the meaning is "a veil of which the veil of Moses is an exact type." The veil which prevented them from seeing the evanescence of the light which shone on the face of Moses was symbolically identical  with that which prevented them also from seeing the transitory character of his Law. It had been as it were taken from his face and laid on their hearts (see <a href="../../par/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27-29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>.). Many commentators have seen in this verse a reference to the Jewish custom of covering the head with the <span class="accented">tallith</span>, a four-cornered veil, when they were in the synagogues. But this is doubtful, since the <span class="accented">tallith</span> did not cover the eyes. More probably his metaphor may have been suggested by <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>, "And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast ever all people, and <span class="accented">the veil</span> that is spread over all nations." <span class="cmt_word">Untaken away.</span> There are two other ways of rendering this verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "For until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth unlifted; which veil is done away in Christ," as in the Revised Version; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The same veil remaineth, it not being revealed that it is done away in Christ," as it is taken by Chrysostom and many others, and in the margin of the Revised Version. The latter seems to be the better view. It is not the veil, but the old covenant, which is being done away in Christ. To the Jews that truth still remained under a veil. The present tense, "is <span class="accented">in course</span> of annulment," might naturally be used until the utter abrogation of even the possible fulfilment of the Mosaic Law at the fall of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">In the reading of the old testament;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the old covenant</span>. There is no allusion to the Old Testament as a <span class="accented">book</span>, but the phrase is equivalent to "Moses is read" in the next verse. (On this obduracy of the Jews, see <a href="../../par/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7, 8, 25</a>.)

Obviously the most natural word to supply is the one last alluded to, namely, "the heart of Israel." The verb may have been suggested by <a href="../../par/exodus/34-31.htm">Exodus 34:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be taken away;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is in course of removal</span>.

To whom shall they turn? To the Lord. "But the Lord is the Spirit." The word "spirit" could not be introduced thus abruptly and vaguely; it must refer to something already said, and therefore to the last mention of the word "spirit" in ver. 3. The Lord is the Spirit, who giveth life and freedom, in antithesis to the spirit of death and legal bondage (see ver. 6; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The best comment on the verse is <a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>, "For the law of the <span class="accented">spirit of life in Christ Jesus</span> hath made me free from the law of sin and death." All life and all religion had become to St. Paul a vision of all things in Christ. He has just said that the spirit giveth life, and, after the digression about the moral blindness which prevented the Jews from being emancipated from the bondage of the letter, it was quite natural for him to add, "Now the Lord <span class="accented">is</span> the Spirit to which I alluded." The connection in which the verse stands excludes a host of untenable meanings which have been attached to it. <span class="cmt_word">There is liberty.</span> The liberty of confidence (ver. 4), and of frank speech (ver. 12), and of sonship (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>), and of freedom from guilt (<a href="../../par/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>); so that the Law itself, obeyed no longer in the mere letter but also in the spirit, becomes a royal law of liberty, and not a yoke which gendereth to bondage (<a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-12.htm">James 2:12</a>) - a service, indeed, but one which is perfect freedom (<a href="../../par/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>).

No other instance occurs in which the verb in the middle voice has the meaning of "reflecting," and the words, "With unveiled face," imply the image of "beholding." They are, in fact, a description of "the beatific vision." An additional reason for retaining the translation of our Authorized Version is that the verb is used in <span class="accented">this</span> sense by Philo ('Leg. Alleg.,' 3:33). <span class="cmt_word">The glory of the Lord.</span> Namely, him who is "the Effulgence of God's glory" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), the true Shechinah, "the Image of the invisible God" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are changed into the same image.</span> The present tense implies a <span class="accented">gradual</span> transfiguration, a mystical and spiritual change which is produced in us while we contemplate Christ. <span class="cmt_word">From glory to glory.</span> Our spiritual assimilation to Christ comes <span class="accented">from</span> his glory and issues in a glory like his (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; comp." from strength to  strength," <a href="../../par/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>). (For the thought, comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>.) As by the Spirit of the Lord. This rendering (which is that of the Vulgate also) can hardly be correct.

He is still referring to the contrast between the letter and the spirit, and his identification of this "spirit" in its highest sense with the quickening life which, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, we receive from Christ, and which is indeed identical with "the Spirit of Christ." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_corinthians/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Corinthians 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_corinthians/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Corinthians 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
