Similarly St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1-3</a>), after speaking of God's fatherhood and the hopes which it inspires, adds, "And every man that hath this hope <span class="accented">in him purifieth himself</span> even as he is pure" (comp. <a href="../../par/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From all filthiness;</span> rather, <span class="accented">from all defilement</span>. Sin leaves on the soul the moral stain of guilt, which was typified by the ceremonial defilements of the Levitical Law (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25, 26</a>). The word used for "filth" in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> is different. <span class="cmt_word">Of the flesh and spirit.</span> From everything which outwardly pollutes the body and inwardly the soul; the two being closely connected together, so that what defiles the flesh inevitably also defiles the soul, and what defiles the spirit degrades also the body. Uncleanness, for instance, a sin of the flesh, is almost invariably connected with pride and hate and cruelty, which degrade the soul. <span class="cmt_word">Perfecting holiness.</span> This is the goal and aim of the Christian, though in this life it cannot be finally attained (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the fear of God.</span> There is, indeed, one kind of fear, a base and servile fear, which is cast out by perfect love; but the fear of reverential awe always remains in the true and wisely instructed Christian, who will never be guilty of the profane familiarity adopted by some ignorant sectarians, or speak of God "as though he were some one in the next street" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).

It is an appeal to them to get rid of the <span class="accented">narrowness</span> of heart, the constricted affections, of which he has complained in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We have wronged...  corrupted...  defrauded no man.</span> The "no man" in the original is placed first, and this emphatic position, together with its triple repetition, marks St. Paul's insistence on the fact that, whatever his enemies might insinuate, there was no <span class="accented">single member</span> of their Church who could complain of injury, moral harm, or unfair treatment from him. Clearly he is again thinking of definite slanders against himself. His sternness to the offender may have been denounced as a wrong; his generous sanction of broad views about clean and unclean meats, idol-offerings, etc., may have been represented as corrupting others by false teaching (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>) or bad example (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>); his urgency about the collection for the saints (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>), or his assertion of legitimate authority, may have been specified as greed for power. The verb <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> is often used in connection with other verbs, implying sensuality. It is difficult for us even to imagine that St. Paul had ever been charged with gross immorality; but it may have been so, for in a corrupt atmosphere everything is corrupt. Men like Nero and Heliogabalus, being themselves the vilest of men, openly declared their belief that no man was pure, and many in the heathen world may have been inclined to similar suspicions. Of Whitefield, the poet says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His sins were such as Sodom never knew,<br />And calumny stood up to swear all true."</span> We know too that the Christians were universally charged with Thyestean banquets and promiscuous licentiousness. It is, however, more natural to take <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> in its <span class="accented">general</span> sense, in which it means "to overreach," "to claim or seize more than one's just rights" (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-6</a> he is defending himself against similar charges, as also in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 5:12; 6:3; 10:7-11; 11; 12.<span class="accented">, passim</span>). For similar strains of defence, see those of Moses and of Samuel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-3.htm">2 Corinthians 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">I speak not <i>this</i> to condemn <i>you</i>: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with <i>you</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak not this to condemn you.</span> "Not by way of condemnation am I speaking." My object is to maintain the old love between us; what I say, therefore, is merely  to defend myself, not to complain of you (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have said before.</span> He has not said it in so many words, but has implied it in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-11.htm">2 Corinthians 6:11-14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are in our hearts.</span> So he says to his beloved Philippians, "I have you in my heart" (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To die and live with you.</span> Similarly he tells the Thessalonians that he was ready to give them even his own life (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>). This is no mere conventional expression of deep affection, like Horace's, "Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;" nor is it the description of some compact for life and death like that of the Theban Band. It has the deeper meaning which was involved by the words "life" and "death" on the lips of a Christian (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>). And one whose life was, for Christ's sake, a daily death, naturally mentions death first. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">Great <i>is</i> my boldness of speech toward you, great <i>is</i> my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Boldness of speech.</span> St. Paul feels that he may address them with perfect frankness and openness (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My glorying of you.</span> "My boasting on your account" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-14.htm">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am filled with comfort.</span> "I have been filled with the consolation." "Consolation" is the word which occurs so frequently in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I am exceeding joyful.</span> "I superabound in my joy" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-2.htm">2 Corinthians 2:2-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In all our tribulation.</span> The clause belongs to both the preceding clauses.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without <i>were</i> fightings, within <i>were</i> fears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For, when we were come into Macedonia.</span> "For <span class="accented">even</span> when we came." The word "affliction" reminds St. Paul to resume the thread of the narrative which makes this letter almost <span class="accented">like an itinerary</span>. He has spoken of his trials in Ephesus (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>) and in the Troad (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12, 13</a>), and now he tells them that <span class="accented">even</span> in Macedonia he was no less troubled and agitated. <span class="cmt_word">Our flesh had no rest.</span> <span class="accented">External</span> troubles assailed him as well as inward anxiety. "Had" seems here to be the best reading (B, F, G, K); not "has had," which may be borrowed from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>. <span class="accented">Rest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remission, respite</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>But we were troubled on every side;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but in everything being afflicted</span>. The style, in its picturesque irregularity, almost seems as though it were broken by sobs. <span class="cmt_word">Without were fightings, within were fears.</span> "From without battles, from within fears." No light is thrown on these "battles." The Acts of the Apostles has no details to give us of this brief stay  in Macedonia. The "fears" were doubtless still connected with anxiety as to the reception of Titus, and of his First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-20.htm">1 Corinthians 12:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who comforteth those that are cast down.</span> "The Comforter of the humble comforted us, even God." The word "humble" has in classical Greek the sense of "mean," "abject." Pride, not humility, was the virtue even of Stoic morality. Christ was the first to reveal the beatitude of lowliness (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>). Doubtless the word still retained some of its old associations, and had been used of St. Paul in a disparaging sense (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>). But he whom his opponents accused of so much egotism, ambition, and arrogance, meekly accepts the term and applies it to himself. God (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>). "The God...  of consolation" (<a href="../../par/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the coming of Titus.</span> This was the cause of that outburst of joy in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13, 14</a>, which passage here finds its explanation. The absence of Titus from the Acts is another proof of the fragmentariness of that book. It is evident that he was an ardent, able, active fellow worker, and most beloved friend of the apostle (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>). We learn most about him from this Epistle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not by his coming only.</span> The mere fact of Titus's arrival cheered St. Paul, because Titus seems to have been of a strong and cheery temperament. St. Paul, partly because of his infirmities, was peculiarly dependent on the support of human sympathy (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-15.htm">Acts 28:15</a>). It was not, however, the mere arrival of Titus which cheered him, but still more the good news which he brought, and which partially lightened his anxieties. In all probability this letter was written almost immediately after the arrival of Titus, and while the joy caused by his presence was still glowing in the apostle's heart. It is characteristic of the seclusion of an austere life that St. Jerome supposes the cause of the apostle's distress to have been that Titus was his interpreter, and that in his absence he could not preach! <span class="cmt_word">Your earnest desire.</span> Your yearning to see me once more. Mourning; rather, <span class="accented">lamentation</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>). They were aroused to lament their past "inflation" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>) and remissness. <span class="cmt_word">Your fervent mind toward me.</span> This rendering well expresses the kindling affection implied by the word <span class="accented">zelos</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>So that I rejoiced the more.</span> More than he had even anticipated could be possible; or, as the next verse may imply, all the more because of his past anguish (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though <i>it were</i> but for a season.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With a letter;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with my Epistle</span>. Probably the First Epistle, though some suppose that the allusion is to a lost  intermediate letter. <span class="cmt_word">I do not repent, though I did repent;</span> better, <span class="accented">I do not regret it</span>. Every one has experienced the anxiety which has followed the despatch of some painful letter. If it does good, well; but perhaps it <span class="accented">may</span> do harm. The severity was called for; it seemed a duty to write severely. But how will the rebuke be received? Might we not have done better if we had used language less uncompromisingly stern? As St. Paul thought with intense anxiety that perhaps in his zeal for truth he may have irrevocably alienated the feelings of the Corinthians, whom, with all their grave faults, he loved, a moment came when he actually regretted what he had written. He himself assures us that he had this feeling. Those who try all kinds of fantastic hypotheses and tortuous exegesis to explain away this phrase as though it were inconsistent with St. Paul's inspiration, go to Scripture to find there their own <span class="accented">a priori</span> dogmas, not to seek what Scripture really says. The doctrine of inspiration is not the fetish into which it has been degraded by formal systems of scholastic theology. Inspiration was not a mechanical dictation of words, but the influence of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men who retained all their own natural emotions. <span class="cmt_word">For I perceive,</span> etc. There are various ways of taking this clause. Nothing, however, is simpler than to regard it as a parenthetic remark (for I see that that Epistle, though it were but for a time, saddened you). <span class="cmt_word">Though it were but for a season.</span> (For the phrase, see <a href="../../par/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>.) He means to say that their grief will at any rate cease when they receive this letter, and he can bear the thought of having pained them when he remembers the brevity of their grief and the good effects which resulted from it.

Sin causes regret, remorse, that sort of repentance (<span class="accented">metomeleia</span>) which is merely an unavailing rebellion against the inevitable consequences of misdoing; but the sorrow of self-reproach which follows true repentance (<span class="accented">metanoia</span>, change of mind) is never followed by regret. Some take "not to be regretted" with "salvation," but it is a very unsuitable adjective to that substantive. <span class="cmt_word">The sorrow of the world.</span> Here sorrow for the loss, or disappointment, or shame, or ruin, or sickness caused by sin; such as the false repentance of Cain, Saul, Ahithophel, Judas, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Death</span>.

The Sinaitic manuscript has "your care for yourselves." The variations have partly risen from the apparent strangeness of the remark that his letter had been written in order that their care for him might be manifested <span class="accented">to themselves</span>; in other words, that  they might learn from their own conduct the reality of their earnest feelings for him. He has already spoken of this "earnest care" of theirs (ver. 11), but not in quite the same sense. Certainly, however, the reading followed by our Authorized Version, even if it be a correction, furnishes a more natural meaning (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>), and the other may have arisen from a clerical error. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore we were comforted,</span> etc. Since my Epistle secured the result of manifesting your true feelings towards me, "we have been comforted." The Revised Version and many editions put the stop here, and continue (reading <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>), <span class="accented">and in addition to our consolation, abundantly the more did we rejoice at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Exceedingly the more.</span> In the Greek this is expressed by double comparatives (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was refreshed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">has been</span> (<span class="accented">and is</span>) <span class="accented">refreshed</span>. The same verb is used in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-18.htm">1 Corinthians 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7, 20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-14.htm">2 Corinthians 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which <i>I made</i> before Titus, is found a truth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am not ashamed.</span> The due rendering of the tenses brings out the sense much more accurately. "Because if I have boasted anything to him on your behalf, I was not put to the blush;" in other words, "One reason of my exceeding gladness was that you fully justified that very favorable picture of you which I had drawn for Titus when I was urging him to be the bearer of my letter." <span class="cmt_word">Is found a truth;</span> literally, <span class="accented">proved itself to be a truth</span>. Here again there is a most delicate reference to the charge of levity and unveracity which had been brought against him (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). I always spoke the truth <span class="accented">to you</span>; but I might well have feared that, in speaking <span class="accented">of you</span> to Titus, my affection for you had led me to overstep the limits of perfect accuracy. But you yourselves, by proving yourselves worthy of all I said of you, have established my perfect truthfulness, even in the only point where I might have thought it doubtful. Nothing could exceed the tact and refinement, the subtle delicacy and beauty, of this gentle remark. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a></div><div class="verse">And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His inward affection.</span> The same word which is so needlessly rendered "bowels" in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>. More abundant. His love for you has been increased by his recent visit. <span class="cmt_word">With fear and trembling.</span> On this Pauline phrase, see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-16.htm">2 Corinthians 7:16</a></div><div class="verse">I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all <i>things</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I rejoice therefore.</span> The "therefore" concludes the whole paragraph, but is omitted in many manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">I have confidence in you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">am bold in you</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I feel courage about you. The phrase in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a> expresses a calmer and less hazardous trust. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_corinthians/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Corinthians 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_corinthians/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Corinthians 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
