The phrase is like the modern "I wish to inform you." In this and the next chapter St. Paul, having fully spoken of the joy which had been caused to him by their reception of his first letter, and having said as much as he then intended to say in answer to the charges insinuated against him, proceeds to give directions about the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem. He had already spoken of it (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a>), but feared that they were behindhand, and now sends Titus to stimulate their zeal. The style throughout is brief and allusive, because he had already, in various ways, brought this matter fully before them. Throughout this section he shows in a remarkable degree the tact, courtesy, high sense of honour, and practical wisdom which were among his many gifts. The "but" with which the chapter begins in the original is St. Paul's ordinary formula of transition, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>, etc. (For the phrase, "we inform you," see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1</a>.) It is one of numberless incidental proofs of the genuineness of this group of Epistles - the Epistles of the second great missionary journey - that the same words, phrases, and thoughts constantly recur in them. <span class="cmt_word">The grace of God</span> (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">Bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which is being bestowed in the Churches</span>. St. Paul wants to tell the Corinthians how extremely liberal the Macedonians have been, since it was his custom to stir up one Church by the example of another (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>); but he begins by speaking of their generosity as a proof of the grace which they are receiving from the Holy Spirit. <span class="accented">The Churches of Macedonia</span>. The only Macedonian Churches of which we have any details in the New Testament are those of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea. They seem to have been peculiarly dear to St. Paul, who was attracted by their cheerfulness in affliction and their generosity in the midst of want. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a great trial of affliction;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in much testing of affliction</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in an affliction which put to the proof their Christian character. "They were not simply afflicted," says St. Chrysostom, "but in such a way as also to become approved by their endurance." (For the word rendered "trial," see <a href="../../par/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>, and in this Epistle, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>.) "Affliction" seems to have befallen the Churches of Macedonia  very heavily (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>), chiefly through the jealousy of the Jews, who excited the hatred of the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The abundance of their joy.</span> Another reference to joy in sadness (see on 2 Corinthians 7:4). There is not the least necessity to understand the verb "is" or "was" after this clause. "The abundance...  abounded" is indeed a pleonasm, but is not at all unlike the style of St. Paul. He means to say that their joy overflowed their affliction, and their liberality overflowed their poverty (<a href="../../par/mark/12-44.htm">Mark 12:44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their deep poverty;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their pauperism to the depth</span>; their abysmal penury. Though they were <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, they showed themselves in generosity to be <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. Stanley refers to Arnold's 'Roman Commonwealth,' where he mentions that the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia, which had suffered greatly in the three civil wars, appealed successfully to Tiberius for a diminution of their burdens. The gift of the Macedonians was like the widow's mite (<a href="../../par/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3, 4</a>, where similar words occur <span class="accented">- perisseuo, husterema</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of their liberality;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of their singleness of purpose</span> or <span class="accented">simplicity</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). The "grace" and single-heartedness to which he alludes <span class="accented">showed</span> themselves in liberality. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-3.htm">2 Corinthians 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">For to <i>their</i> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <i>their</i> power <i>they were</i> willing of themselves;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were willing of themselves.</span> "Of their own accord," as in ver. 17. The verb in the original is energetically omitted, with the "they gave" of ver. 5. St. Paul does not mean that the notion of making the collection <span class="accented">originated</span> with them (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>), but only that they displayed a voluntary energy in carrying it out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-4.htm">2 Corinthians 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <i>take upon us</i> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Praying us.</span> The entreaties came from them, not from me. <span class="cmt_word">That we would receive.</span> These words are almost certainly an explanatory gloss. The translation then is, "begging us for the grace of participation in this ministration to the saints." They were so willing in the matter that they entreated me, as a favour (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), to allow them to have a share in this contribution, because it was to be given to the saints, that is, the suffering peer in the Church of Jerusalem. This Church suffered from chronic poverty. Even the Jewish population were liable to famines, in one of which they had only been kept alive by the royal munificence of a proselyte, Queen Helena,of Adiabene. The Christians would, of course, suffer even more deeply, because they were drawn from the humblest classes and had fewer friends. This was one of the reasons why, as an act of common humanity, it was incumbent on the Gentile Christians to help them (<a href="../../par/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25, 26</a>). St. Paul had already brought the subject to the notice of the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-5.htm">2 Corinthians 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>this they did</i>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not as we hoped;</span> rather, <span class="accented">not as we expected</span>. They were so poor that it was impossible to expect much from them, but they surpassed my expectations in every way. The Church of Philippi, perhaps under the influence of Lydia, was remarkable for generosity, and was the only Church from which St. Paul would accept any personal help (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">First</span>. "They gave <span class="accented">themselves</span> to the Lord, which is the best of all, and they gave themselves as helpers to us also - by the will of God." (For a similar use of "and" to imply a matter of less importance, see <a href="../../par/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>.) The phrase, "by the will of God," implies thanksgiving to God for the grace which enabled them to give themselves to him, and their goods to his saints. Being "a peculiar people," they naturally showed themselves "zealous of good works" (<a href="../../par/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>). <span class="accented">First</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9, 10</a>).

The remarks that follow are full of delicate reserve, but under their exquisite tact and urbanity we can perceive that the Corinthians had <span class="accented">talked</span> very loudly about their contributions, and had promised with great zeal, but had shown themselves somewhat slack in redeeming their promises. <span class="cmt_word">We exhorted Titus.</span> It is curious that this word is constantly used of the missions of Titus (ver. 17; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As he had began.</span> "That as no inaugurated (this collection), so he would also complete towards you this gracious work also." Among other works of grace which Titus might complete by returning to them from Macedonia was the kindly collection which he had begun to set on foot in his previous visit (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, as ye abound in every <i>thing, in</i> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <i>in</i> all diligence, and <i>in</i> your love to us, <i>see</i> that ye abound in this grace also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. In the following verses to ver. 15 he tells them his wishes about this collection. He desires them to show generosity among their other graces (ver. 7), not by way of command, but that they may emulate others and show their love (ver. 8) by following the example of Christ (ver. 9). And by acting thus they would prove the sincerity of their former promises (vers. 10, 11), especially as he did not wish them to give more than they could justly spare by way of reciprocity (vers. 12-15). <span class="cmt_word">As ye abound in every thing, in faith,</span> etc. Perhaps "by faith," etc., "St. Paul," says Grotius, "knew the art of the orators to move by praising." This method of conciliating attention is technically called <span class="accented">proparaitesis</span>. The praise was, of course, sincere, though, no doubt, it was expressed with the generosity of love (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And in your love to us.</span> The Greek is more emphatic," and by the love from you in us;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the love which streams from you, and  which I feel in myself. <span class="cmt_word">In this grace also;</span> namely, the grace of Christian liberality. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not by commandment</span>. St. Paul felt an honourable sensibility which prevented him from straining his authority by <span class="accented">urging</span> the Corinthians to give of their substance.

The word for "poverty" would, in classical Greek, mean "pauperism" or "mendicancy." Dean Stanley (referring to Milman's 'Latin Christianity,' 5. bk. 12. c. 6) points out how large a place this verse occupied in the mediaeval controversies between the moderate and the extreme members of the mendicant orders. William of Ockham and others, taking the word "poverty" in its extremest sense, maintained that the Franciscans ought to possess <span class="accented">nothing</span>; but Pope John XXII., with the Dominicans, took a more rational view of the sense and of the historic facts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a></div><div class="verse">And herein I give <i>my</i> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And herein I give my advice</span>; <span class="accented">and in this matter I offer an opinion</span> (<span class="accented">only</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For this is expedient for you</span>. It is more to your advantage that I should merely suggest and advise you about the matter than command you. <span class="cmt_word">Who have begun;</span> rather, <span class="accented">seeing that you formerly began</span>. The verb is the same as in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">Not only to do, but also to be forward;</span> rather, <span class="accented">not only to do, but also to be willing</span>. The "to do" is in the aorist, the "to be willing" in the present. We should naturally have expected a reversed order, "not only to be willing, but also to put in action." There must be a strong touch of irony in the words, unless we interpret it to mean "not only to make the collection, but to be willing to add yet more to it." Perhaps in the "to be willing" lies the notion of "the cheerful giver," "the willing mind "(ch. 9:7; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A year ago;</span> rather, <span class="accented">since the previous year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> last year (ch. 9:2). They had probably begun to collect in the previous Easter, and it was now soon after Tisri, or September, the beginning of the Jewish civil year.

In other words, I have no wish that you should <span class="accented">distress</span> yourselves to set others at ease. You must not suspect me of Jewish proclivities which would lead me to impoverish you to provide luxuries for the Christians at Jerusalem. Others refer it to the Macedonians: "I do not wish to burden you, but the Macedonians, who are poor, have contributed, and if you join them in this good work now they may help you hereafter." But there is no hint of this anywhere. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">But by an equality, <i>that</i> now at this time your abundance <i>may be a supply</i> for their want, that their abundance also may be <i>a supply</i> for your want: that there may be equality:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But by an equality,</span> etc. The verse, like so many in this chapter, is expressed very elliptically: "But by a reciprocal fairness in the present case, your superabundance to their lack, that also their superabundance may be in proportion to your lack, that there may come to be reciprocal fairness." St. Paul may possibly be thinking of the reciprocity of spiritual and temporal benefits, as in <a href="../../par/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>; but if so he leaves the thought unexpressed. The application of the text to "works of supererogation" (Art. XIV.), as forming a fund at the disposal of the hierarchy in the way of indulgences, pardons, etc., is a singular perversion.

There can be no reference to any of the four written Gospels, for they were not in the hands of Christians till a later date; nor did the word "gospel" acquire this significance till afterwards. From <a href="../../par/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5</a>, it is somewhat precariously inferred that  St. Luke is meant. Others have conjectured Barnabas, Silas (who are out of the question), Erastus, Mark, a brother of Titus, etc. St. Luke is not unlikely to have been selected as a delegate by the Church of Philippi; but further than this we can say nothing. St. Luke was not a Macedonian by birth, and any Macedonian (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Aristarchus, Sopater, Secundus, Epaphroditus) seems to be excluded by <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>.

The word "avoiding" (<span class="accented">stellomenoi</span>) literally means "furling sail," and then "taking precautions." It may, however, mean "making this arrangement" (see <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>). Too much stress has been laid on St. Paul's "use of nautical terms" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>, etc.). They belong, in fact, to the very phraseology of the Greek language. <span class="cmt_word">That no man should blame us</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>). St. Paul here sets a valuable and necessary example to all Christians who are entrusted with the management of charitable funds. It is their duty to take every step which may place them above the possibility of of suspicion. Their management of the sums entrusted to them should be obviously and transparently business-like and honourable. St. Paul taught this behaviour both by example and by precept (<a href="../../par/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>). There is such a thing as a foolish and reprehensible indifference to public opinion (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>). Yet with all his noble carefulness, St. Paul did not escape this very slander (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In this abundance.</span> The word, which occurs here only, means literally "succulence," but in the LXX. the adjective means "rich" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>). It here implies that the sum which had been collected by St. Paul's exertion was a large one.

Not only in the sight of the Lord. Such precautions would be unnecessary if others were not concerned, for God knows our honesty (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But also before men.</span> Although the text "avoid all <span class="accented">appearance</span> of evil" should be rendered "avoid every species of evil," the mistranslation conveys a wise lesson. "In a field of melons," says the Chinese proverb. "do not stoop to tie your shoe;" for that will <span class="accented">look</span> as if you wanted to steal one of the melons.

Clement, Epaenetus, Apollos, Luke, Zenas, Sosthenes, Trophimus, and Tychicus have all been suggested. Stanley conjectures that the two who accompanied Titus were the Ephesians Tychicus and Trophimus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>).
