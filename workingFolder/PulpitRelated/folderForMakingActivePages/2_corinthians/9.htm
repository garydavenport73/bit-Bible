This word shows that he is continuing the same subject, and therefore excludes the supposition that this chapter is a separate letter or fragment. No doubt, however, the express mention of the collection after he has been practically writing about it through the whole of the last chapter looks as if he had been interrupted, or had left off dictating at the end of the last verse. Such breaks must often and necessarily have occurred in the dictation of the Epistles, and doubtless help to account for some of their phenomena. Perhaps, on reperusing the last paragraphs  before resuming the subject he observed that, after all, he had not directly mentioned the contribution, and therefore explains that he thought it superfluous to do so. <span class="cmt_word">To the saints.</span> The poor Christians of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-4.htm">2 Corinthians 8:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Superfluous</span>.

The tense shows that he is writing from Macedonia, probably from Philippi (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-24.htm">2 Corinthians 8:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Achaia</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was ready a year ago;</span> <span class="accented">has been prepared since last year</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Your zeal hath provoked very many;</span> literally, <span class="accented">zeal from you hath stimulated the majority</span>. "Zeal <span class="accented">from</span> you" means zeal which emanated from the Corinthians and aroused emulation in others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-3.htm">2 Corinthians 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They of Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Macedonians</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any friends from Macedonia (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). Shall Achaians have to blush before Macedonians? <span class="cmt_word">We, that we say not ye.</span> Nothing can exceed the delicacy of this touch. St. Paul asks them to be ready with their contributions for <span class="accented">his</span> sake, not for their own; that <span class="accented">he</span> may not have to blush for his generous words respecting them, whereas really the discredit would be simply theirs. <span class="cmt_word">Confident boasting;</span> rather, <span class="accented">confidence</span>. The reading "of boasting" is not genuine here. For the word <span class="accented">hypostasis</span> in the sense of "confidence," see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-4.htm">Hebrews 3:4</a>. The use of the word to represent the "Persons" of the Blessed Trinity is later. The other sense of the word, "substance" (or underlying base of attributes), is found in <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-5.htm">2 Corinthians 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as <i>a matter of</i> bounty, and not as <i>of</i> covetousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they would go before unto you.</span> The triple repetition of the word "before" shows how earnest St. Paul is in the matter. The Corinthians had promised largely; it was evident that there had been, or that there was ground for fearing that there might be, some slackness of performance. St. Paul was so unwilling to have seemed inaccurate in what, he had said about them in Macedonia that he wished to give them ample notice before the Macedonian delegates arrived. <span class="cmt_word">Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before;</span> <span class="accented">your previously promised blessing, bounty</span>; literally, <span class="accented">blessing</span>. The mere word should have acted as an inducement to generosity. See the use of the word to express a generous gift in <a href="../../par/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>, etc. (LXX.); <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>. In this sense it resembles the Hebrew <span class="accented">berachah</span> (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">As a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness;</span> <span class="accented">as a blessing, and not as an extortion</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a free gift of your own, and not as something which I had wrung from you, or "got out of you" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-17.htm">2 Corinthians 12:17, 18</a>). It is less likely that the word <span class="accented">pleonexia</span> refers to the "parsimony" of the Corinthians, as though the <span class="accented">smallness</span> of their gift would show their greed for large gains. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">But this <i>I say</i>, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this I say.</span> The Greek only has "But this." The ellipse can hardly be "I say." It is an accusative used absolutely  - "as to their." Compare "But one thing" (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall reap also sparingly.</span> In the Greek the more emphatic order is "sparingly also shall reap." The metaphor of the harvest implies that the more generous the gift the richer will be the return; and that "withholding more than is meet" will only tend to poverty (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>). (For "sowing" and "reaping" in this connection, comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Bountifully</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with blessings</span>; Vulgate, in <span class="accented">benedictionibus</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7, 8</a>). Bountifulness blesses both him that gives and him that takes.

Compare "He that showeth mercy, with <span class="accented">cheerfulness"</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>). The rabbis said that cheerful kindness, even if nothing was given, was better than a morose gift.

The word <span class="accented">autarkeia</span> (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>) in the Stoic philosophy was used for the perfect independence which enabled a man to stand alone. The term is here softened and Christianized to express the contentment which arises from the full supply of all our needs by God. The affirmations of the original are as emphatic as language can make them. They express that the man who places all his trust upon God will be "perfect and entire, lacking nothing" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11, 19</a>).

At Athens a <span class="accented">choragus</span> was one who furnished a chorus, and as this was a <span class="accented">leitourgia</span> (or "public service"), involving great expense, and often discharged with extreme munificence, the verb came to imply "provide abundantly."

Generally it means "religious service" (<a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>).

The saints at Jerusalem would, in consequence of the proved sincerity of the Corinthians, glorify God with thanksgiving for their faithfulness and kindness, by prayer for them. The Revisers take the clause with the following participle, "while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you."
