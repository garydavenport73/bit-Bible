The prominence of the word "manifest" in this Epistle is remarkable.

He has spoken of "manifestation of the truth," and yet has spoken of all Jews as unable to see it because they will not remove from their hearts the veil which hides it from them. How can "a veiled gospel" be a "manifested truth"? The answer is that the gospel is bright, but the eyes that should gaze on it are wilfully closed. Similarly in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>, he has compared the gospel to a fragrance of life, yet to the doomed captives - "to the perishing"  - it comes "like a waft from the charnel house."

He is not, however, here called a god of the kosmos, but only of the <span class="accented">olam hazzeh</span>, the present dispensation of things as it exists among those who refuse to enter that kingdom in which the power of Satan is brought to nought. The melancholy attempt to get rid of Manichean arguments by rendering the verse "in whom God blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers of this world" is set aside by the fact that the terrible description of Satan as "another god" (<span class="accented">El acheer</span>) was common among the rabbis. They knew that his power was indeed a derivative power, trot still that it was permitted to be great (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).

The verb here has no other meaning than "to blind," and is quite different from the verb "to harden," rendered by "to blind" in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> with the same substantive. They are blind from lack of faith, and so being "unbelieving" they are" perishing" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>), seeing that they "walk in darkness" (<a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and are in Satan's power (<a href="../../par/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>).

There is an implied comparison between the creation of light and the dawn of the gospel light, and each of these was meant for the good of all the world. The verse should be rendered, if we follow the best manuscripts, "Because it is God, who said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God." <span class="cmt_word">In the face of Jesus Christ</span> (see ch. 2:10; 3:7).

The word <span class="accented">skenos</span>, vessel, is used in <a href="../../par/mark/11-16.htm">Mark 11:16</a>, and "vessels of earthenware" in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>. St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, is called "a vessel of election," whence Dante calls him <span class="accented">lo vas d</span> <span class="accented">elezione</span>. Man can never be more than an earthen vessel, being frail and humble, and the metaphor specially suits an apostle of Christ (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a>). But when he takes the Word of life from the earthen pitcher and waves it in the air, it illuminates all on whom the light shines. No commentator seems to have seen the probable allusion to Gideon's pitchers. It is the "light," of which he has been speaking exclusively in the last verses, which constitutes the "treasure." Those who suppose that the "treasure" is gold or silver or something else of value, refer to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a>, and Herod., 3:103; Pers., 'Sat.,' 2:10. <span class="cmt_word">The excellency</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the excess</span> or <span class="accented">abundance</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of God, and not of us;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of God, and not from us</span>.

It is not only "the sufferings," but even "the dying," of Christ of which his true followers partake (<a href="../../par/romans/8-36.htm">Romans 8:36</a>, "For thy sake are we killed all the day long"). St. Paul, who was "in deaths oft" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>), was thus being made conformable unto Christ's death (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). Philo, too, compares life to "the daily carrying about of a corpse," and the Cure d'Ars used to speak of his body as "ce cadavre." <span class="cmt_word">That the life also of Jesus,</span> etc. The thought is exactly the same as in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>, "If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him."

The life of Jesus is manifested, not only "in our <span class="accented">body</span>," but even by way of triumph in its lowest and poorest element.

And this faith inspires him with the conviction that, after "the body of this death," and after this death in life, there should begin for him also the life in death. St. Paul says nothing as to the authorship of the psalm, which probably belongs to a period far later than that of David.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward <i>man</i> is renewed day by day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - The <span class="accented">Christian minister is upheld by hope</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding <i>and</i> eternal weight of glory;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For our light affliction, which is but for a moment;</span> <span class="accented">literally, for the immediate lightness of our affliction</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Worketh for us.</span> Is bringing about for us, with all the immeasurable force of a natural and progressive law. <span class="cmt_word">A far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in excess unto excess</span>. For the phrase, "to excess  - characteristic, like other emotional expressions, of this group of Epistles -  see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>. The word "eternal" is in antithesis to the "for a moment." The "weight" is suggested by the "lightness," and possibly also by the fact that in Hebrew the word for "glory" also means "weight." The general contrast is found also in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>. The frequent resemblances between this Epistle and that to the Romans are natural when we remember that they were written within a few months of each other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen <i>are</i> temporal; but the things which are not seen <i>are</i> eternal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While we look not at the things which are seen.</span> The Greek suggests more of a reason, "Since we are not gazing at things visible" (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Things which are not seen.</span> The negative is the <span class="accented">subjective</span> negative. It expresses not only the fact that now these things are not seen, but that it is their <span class="accented">nature</span> to be unseen by the bodily eyes. <span class="cmt_word">Temporal</span>. That is, temporary, transitory, phantasmal, a passing world; for which reason we do not fix our gaze or our aim upon it. But the things which are not seen are eternal The clause is important, as showing that eternity is not a mere extension of time, but a condition qualitatively different from time. The "things eternal" exist as much now as they will ever do. We are as much living in eternity now as we ever shall be. The only difference will be that we shall then see him who is now unseen, and realize the things which now are only visible to the eye of faith. This is one of the passages of St. Paul which finds a close parallel in Seneca ('Ep.,' 59). "<span class="accented">Invisibilia non decipiunt"</span> was, as Bishop Wordsworth tells us, the inscription put at the end of his garden arcade by Dr. Young, the poet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_corinthians/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Corinthians 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_corinthians/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Corinthians 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
