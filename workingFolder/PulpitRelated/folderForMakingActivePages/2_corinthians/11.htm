It involves an indignant sense that he had been most disparagingly compared with other apostles, as though he were hardly a genuine apostle at all. Yet he reckons himself to have done as much as the "above exceedingly" - or, as it might be expressed, the "out and out," "extra-super," or "super-apostolic," apostles. There is here no reflection whatever on the twelve; he merely means that, even if any with whom he was uufavourably contrasted were "apostles ten times over," he can claim to be in the front rank with them. This is no more than he has said with the utmost earnestness in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>. There is no self-assertion here; but, in consequence of the evil done by his detractors, St. Paul, with an utter sense of distaste, is forced to say the simple truth.

The fact that so many of the converts were downtrodden slaves and artisans would make them less likely to resent conduct to which they were daily accustomed among the heathen. Neither Greeks nor Orientals felt to anything like the same extent as ourselves the disgrace of a blow. That sense of disgrace rises flora the freedom which Christianity has gradually wrought for us, and the deep sense of the dignity of human nature, which it has inspired Christ had been so smitten, and so was Paul himself long afterwards (<a href="../../par/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>), and he had to teach even Christian bishops that they must be "no strikers" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>).

The question arises - Was St. Luke entirely unaware of all these scenes of anguish and daily martyrdom?

His relations with Damascus are confirmed by coins (see 'Life of St. Paul,' exc. 8.). <span class="cmt_word">Kept...  with a garrison;</span> literally, <span class="accented">was guarding</span>. It is said in <a href="../../par/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a> that the <span class="accented">Jews</span> did this; but they could not in any case have done it without leave from the ethnarch, and <span class="accented">qui facit per alium, facit per se</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Desirous to apprehend me.</span> Both words are a little stronger in the Greek - "determining to seize me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a></div><div class="verse">And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through a window.</span> A "little door," or lattice in some house which abutted on the wall. <span class="cmt_word">In a basket</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>). The word used by St. Luke in <a href="../../par/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a> is <span class="accented">spuris</span>, which is a general name for a large basket. The word here used is <span class="accented">sargane</span>, which is defined by Hesychius to be a basket of wickerwork, but which may also mean a rope basket. This particular incident, no doubt, seems to be less perilous and trying than many which St. Paul has already mentioned. We must, however, remember that escape from a window in the lofty wall of a city guarded by patrols was very perilous, and also that such a method of concealment was very trying to the dignity of an Oriental rabbi,   such as St. Paul had been. Further, it is clear that St. Paul only mentions this as the earliest incident in along line of perils which it had been his original intention to recount. But at this point he was interrupted, and laid aside his task of dictation - an incident which has not unfrequently had its effect in literature. When next he resumed, the Epistle, he was no longer in the mood to break through his rule of reticence on these subjects. He had played "the fool" and "the madman," as he says of himself with indignant irony, enough; and he proceeds to speak of other personal claims which he regards as more Important and more Divine. Of all "chapters of unwritten history," not one is more deeply to be regretted than the one which we have them lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_corinthians/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Corinthians 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_corinthians/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Corinthians 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
