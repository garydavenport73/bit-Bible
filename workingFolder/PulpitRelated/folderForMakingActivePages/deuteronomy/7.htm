Of the ten nations named by God in his promise to Abraham, only six are mentioned here, those omitted being the Kenites, the Kennizites, the Kadmonites, and the Rephaim. The Rephaim were by this time extinct as a tribe, Og, "the last of the Rephaim," having been conquered, and he and his people destroyed by the Israelites. The three other tribes lay probably beyond the confines of Canaan, in that region promised to Abraham, but which was not included in the territory conquered by the people under Joshua. This may account for their not being mentioned here. One nation, the Hivites, appears here which is not in the enumeration in Genesis. This name seems to have been borne by more tribes than one, or by a tribe existing in divisions widely scattered, for we find the Hivite in the center of Palestine (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>), in the Shephelah (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>), in the laud of Mizpeh under Hermon (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), "in Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entering in of Hamath" (<a href="../../par/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>), and among tribes in the north of Canaan (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-17.htm">Genesis 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-15.htm">1 Chronicles 1:15</a>).

It may be doubted if <span class="accented">tirosh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>), properly means wine. The word is often rendered in the Authorized Version by new wine, and this is the meaning generally given in the lexicons. As, however, it is almost constantly joined with corn and oil, the immediate products of the soil - at least as unchanged by any process or manufacture - it is rather to be regarded as designating ripe grapes than wine. That, moreover, which was to be <span class="accented">gathered</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>), which might be <span class="accented">tithed</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>), which might be described as <span class="accented">fruit</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>), as <span class="accented">being in the cluster</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a>), and as capable of being <span class="accented">dried up</span> or <span class="accented">parched</span> (<a href="../../par/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>), and <span class="accented">trodden</span> (<a href="../../par/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>), could not be a fluid like fermented nine. As the grape  juice, however, was that from which wine was elicited, <span class="accented">tirosh</span> is sometimes used tropically for wine (<a href="../../par/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>), Just as corn is used for bread (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>). The <span class="accented">oil</span> here mentioned, and elsewhere joined with <span class="accented">dagan</span> and <span class="accented">tirosh</span>, is the pure fresh olive oil (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine), obtained by pressure from the berries of the olive, and used for food as well as for other purposes by the Jews (see notes on Deuteronomy 8:8). <span class="cmt_word">Flocks of thy sheep.</span> The Hebrew is very peculiar here; the same expression occurs only in this book (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4, 18, 51</a>). Literally rendered, it is <span class="accented">the Astartes</span> (Ashtaroth) <span class="accented">of thy sheep</span>. Kimchi says it means "the females of the sheep" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>), and this Gesenius adopts, rendering the phrase by "ewes." Astarte ('Ash-toreth, plu. 'Ashtaroth) was the Phoenician Venus, and it is supposed that the females of the flock were called Astartes orVenuses, as propagating the flock. There is, however, another way of explaining the word as here used, by referring it to a root '<span class="accented">ashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), signifying to be multiplied, to be rich; whence the name given to the females as the multipliers of the flock, without any reference to Astarte.

Not all at once, however, should the former occupants of the country be driven out; this should be done by degrees, lest, the land being suddenly depopulated, the wild animals would increase too much, so as to be a source of danger and trouble to the settlers; but ultimately they should be utterly destroyed, and with them all the objects and implements of their idolatrous worship. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt consume</span>; literally, <span class="accented">eat</span>, <span class="accented">devour</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;</span>).

Instances are on record of armies being obliged to give way before swarms of insects by which they were attacked (as in the case of Julian, who was compelled by a host of flies and gnats to change his route in retreating from Parthia; Atom. Marcell., 24, 8); but it may be doubted if the statement here is to be understood literally, and not rather figuratively, as expressive of many and varied evils with which the fugitive Canaanites were to be visited until they were extirpated (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>, compared with Joshua 10:22-27).
