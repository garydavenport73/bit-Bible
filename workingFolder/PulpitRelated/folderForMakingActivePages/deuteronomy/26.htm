The offerer was to accompany his presentation with the declaration, "I profess this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord swore unto our fathers for to give us;" and the priest having set the basket down before the altar, the offerer was to make confession and prayer, gratefully acknowledging the Divine favor showed to Israel in choosing them to be a great nation, in delivering them out of Egypt, and bringing them into a rich and fertile land; and along with this his bounty to the individual who now presented the firstfruits of his land unto the Lord.

The translation "ready to perish" fairly represents the Hebrew; the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> means not merely to stray or wander, but also to lose one's self, to perish, to be in danger of perishing (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>, etc.). Different renderings of this clause have been given. The Targum, Vulgate, Luther, etc., have, "The Aramaean (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Laban) oppressed my father;" The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> ("My father left Syria"); others, "To the Aramaean my father wandered." But these either follow another reading than that of the received text, or they are expedients to soften down the apparent ignominy of the description. The probable allusion to the wandering, nomadic life of the patriarch, however, is not to be lost sight cf. <span class="cmt_word">With a few</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in men of few</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. consisting of few men, as a small company; the father and head of the tribe is named for those belonging to him (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A great nation</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7, 9</a>).

According to the Law, the firstfruits were the perquisite of the priest (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>, etc.); but of these a portion was to be taken for this special service, and of that a feast was to be made. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a></div><div class="verse">When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, <i>which is</i> the year of tithing, and hast given <i>it</i> unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - On the occasion of presenting the tithes, a special service was also to be made. The tithe here referred to is the vegetable or predial tithe, which, at the end of each third year, as here prescribed, was to be converted into a gift to the poor and needy. This, properly the second tithe (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but usually called the third tithe (Tobit 1:7, 8; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 22), is quite distinct from the Levitical tithe prescribed in <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-32</a>; and it is a mistake to suppose that the law here was designed to contravene or supersede that in the earlier books (see Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:1010). As this tithe completed the triennial series of tithes which the Israelites had to offer, it was fitting that in presenting it a solemn declaration should be made by the offerer to the effect that he had honorably and conscientiously discharged all the obligations in this respect which the Law laid upon him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third year, which is the year of tithing</span>. As each week ended with a Sabbath, so a sabbatical year ended each cycle or week of years; and as on it no tithes were levied, "the year of tithing" here specified would be the third and the sixth years in each septennial period.

Or the reference may be here to the expenses incurred by the death of one for whose funeral the individual had to provide. This view is adopted by Dr. Thomson, who, remarking on this passage, says, "This was the strongest possible protestation that he had dealt faithfully in the matter of tithing and consecrated things and in charities to the poor. He had not allowed himself to divert anything to other uses, not even by the most pressing and unforeseen emergencies. It is here assumed, or rather implied, that times of mourning for the dead were expensive, and also that the stern law of custom obliged the bereaved to defray those expenses, however onerous.... The temptation, therefore, to devote a part of the tithes, hallowed things, and charities to defray these enormous, unforeseen, and providential expenses would be very urgent, and he who stood faithful at such times might safely be trusted on all other occasions" ('Land and the Book,' 1:149). The LXX. rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "to the dead," has led some to suppose that the reference here is to the placing of articles of food in the tomb along with the corpse; but though this custom prevailed among the Jews in later times, as well as among other peoples, there is no ground for supposing it to be referred to here. As all connected with a dead body was held to be unclean, as well as the body itself, a house of mourning with its inhabitants was held to he unclean, and into it, therefore, nothing that had been hallowed might be lawfully carried.
