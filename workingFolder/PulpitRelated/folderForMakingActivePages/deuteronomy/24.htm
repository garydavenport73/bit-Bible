In the Targum of Onkelos, the expression is explained by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>; "aliquid foeditatis" (London Polyglot); "iniquitas rei alicujus"(Buxtorf); "the transgression of a [Divine] word" (Levi). On this the school of Hillel among the rabbins put the interpretation that a man might divorce his wife for any unbecomingness (Mishna, 'Gittin,' 9:10), or indeed for any cause, as the Pharisees in our Lord's day taught (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>). The school of Shammai, on the other hand, taught that only for something disgraceful, such as adultery, could a wife be divorced (Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebrews et Talm.,' on <a href="../../par/matthew/5-31.htm">Matthew 5:31</a>, Opp., tom. 2:290). Adultery, however, cannot be supposed here because that was punishable with death. <span class="cmt_word">A bill of divorcement</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a writing of excision</span>; the man and woman having by marriage become one flesh, the divorce of the woman was a cutting of her off from the one whole. Lightfoot has given (lee. et.) different forms of letters of divorce in use among the Jews (see also Maimonides, 'De Divortiis,' <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4.htm">Deuteronomy 4</a>. &sect; 12).

The prohibition of a return of the wife to her first husband, as well as the necessity of a formal bill of divorcement being given to the woman before she could be sent away, could not fail to be checks on the license of divorce, as doubtless they were intended to be.

"By this law God showed how he approved of holy wedlock (as by the former he showed his hatred of unjust divorces) when, to encourage the newly married against the cumbrances which that estate bringeth with it, and to settle their love each to other, he exempted those men from all wars, cares, and expenses, that they might the more comfortably provide for their own estate" (Ainsworth).

Neither the mill itself nor the upper millstone, the removal of which would render the mill useless, was to be taken. The upper millstone is still called the rider by the Arabs (Hebrew <span class="accented">reehebh</span>, Arabic <span class="accented">rekkab</span>). F<span class="cmt_word">or he taketh a man's life to pledge</span>; <span class="accented">or for</span> (thereby) <span class="accented">life itself is pledged</span>; if a man were deprived of that by which food for the sustaining of life could be prepared, his life itself would be imperiled (cf. <a href="../../par/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-27.htm">Proverbs 22:27</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a></div><div class="verse">Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, <i>so</i> ye shall observe to do.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - The law concerning the leprosy is in <a href="../../par/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13, 14</a>. By this law the priests are directed how to proceed with those afflicted with leprosy; and here the people are counseled by Moses to follow the directions of the priests in this case, however painful it might be for them to submit to the restrictions that would be thereby imposed upon them, remembering what the Lord did to Miriam the sister of Moses, how even she was separated from the camp by the express command of God until she was healed (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>). Michaelis, Keil, and others, following the Vulgate ("Observa diligenter ne incurras plagam leprae sed facies quaecunque docuerint to sacerdotes"), understand this passage as inculcating obedience to the priests, lest leprosy should be incurred as a punishment for disobedience. But it is improbable that a general counsel to submit to the priests should be introduced among the special counsels here given; and besides, the formula <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> means, "Take heed to yourself in respect of" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>), rather than "Beware of," or "Be on your guard against."

He might stand outside and summon the debtor to produce his pledge, but he was not insolently to enter the house and lay hands on any part of the owner's property. To stand outside and call is still a common mode of seeking access to a person in his own house or apartment among the Arabs, and is regarded as the only respectful mode. There would be thus a mitigation of the severity of the exaction, the tendency of which would be to preserve good feeling between the parties. If the debtor was needy, and being such could give in pledge only some necessary article, such as his upper garment in which he slept at night, the pledge was to be returned ere nightfall, that the man might sleep in his own raiment, and have a grateful feeling towards his creditor. In many parts of the East, with the Arabs notably, it is customary for the poor to sleep in their outer garment. "During the day the poor while at work can and do dispense with this outside raiment, but at night it is greatly needed, even in summer. This furnishes a good reason why this sort of pledge should be restored before night" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:192, 500). The earlier legislation (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25, 26</a>) is evidently assumed here as well known by the people. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be righteousness unto thee</span> (see on Deuteronomy 6:25).

Marcell., 23. 6; Curtius, 6:11, 20; Claudian, 'In Eutrop.,' 2:478; Cicero, 'Epist. ad Brut.,' 12, 15). Such severity of retribution is here prohibited in the penal code of the Israelites. Though God, in the exercise of his absolute sovereignty, might visit the sins of the parent upon the children (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), earthly judges were not to assume this power. Only the transgressor himself was to bear the penalty of his sin (cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>).

To enforce this, the people are reminded that they themselves as a nation had been in the condition of strangers and bondmen in Egypt (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33, 34</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-18.htm">Deuteronomy 24:18</a></div><div class="verse">But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</div><div class="comm">
