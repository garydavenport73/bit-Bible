He humbled them that he might test the state of their heart and affections towards him, using the distress and privations to which they were subjected as means of bringing out what was in them, and of leading them to feel their entire dependence on him for help, sustenance, and guidance. Not only by commands difficult to be obeyed laid on men, and by mighty works done in their view, does God prove men (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>); but also by afflictions and calamities (<a href="../../par/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>; 3:4; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/81-7.htm">Psalm 81:7</a>, etc.), as well as by benefits (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). Humbled so as to see his own weakness, chastised out of all self-conceit by affliction, man is brought to submit to God, to hear and obey him; and along with this the experience of God's goodness tends to draw men, in grateful acknowledgment of his mercy and bounty, to yield themselves to him and sincerely and lovingly to serve him (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - God's dealings with the Israelites were disciplinary. Both by the afflictions and privations to which they were subjected, and by the provision they received and the protection afforded to them, God sought to bring them into and keep them in a right state of mind towards him - a state of humble dependence, submissive obedience, and hopeful trust. But that this effect should be produced, it was needful that they should mark and remember all his ways towards them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, <i>and</i> to prove thee, to know what <i>was</i> in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every <i>word</i> that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - God humbled the Israelites by leaving them to suffer hunger from the want of food, and then supplying them with food in a miraculous manner. They were thus taught that their life depended wholly on God, who could, by his own creative power, without any of the ordinary means, provide for the sustaining of their life. <span class="cmt_word">And fed thee with manna</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a>). It is in vain to seek to identify this with any natural product. It was something entirely new to the Israelites - a thing which neither they nor their fathers knew; truly bread from heaven, and which got from them the name of <span class="accented">manna</span> or <span class="accented">man</span>, because, in their wondering ignorance, they knew not what to call it, and so they said one to another, <span class="accented">Manhoo?</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>), <span class="accented">What is it?</span> and thenceforward called it <span class="accented">man</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>That he might make thee know</span>, etc. "Bread," which the Jews regarded as "the staff of life," stands here, as in other places, for food generally; and the lesson taught the Israelites was that not in one way or by. one kind of means alone could life be sustained, but in the absence of these God could, by his own fiat, provide for the sustenance of his children. <span class="cmt_word">Every word</span> - literally, <span class="accented">all</span>, everything whatever - <span class="cmt_word">that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord</span>, i.e. all means which God has by his word provided, or by his word can provide, for the sustenance of life. So our Lord cites this passage in replying to the tempter, who had suggested that if he was the Son of God he might relieve himself from the pangs of hunger by commanding the stones which lay around to become bread. Our Lord's reply to this is virtually." I have this power, and could use it, but I will not; for this would imply impatience and distrust of God, who has engaged to sustain the life of his servants, and who can, by the mere word of his mouth, by his creative will, provide in an extraordinary way for the sustenance of life when the ordinary means of life are wanting." "Jesus means to say, ' I leave it with God to care for the sustaining of my life, and I will not arbitrarily and for selfish ends help myself by a miracle'" (De Wette, note on Matthew 4:4; see also Meyer on the place). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-4.htm">Deuteronomy 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - As the manna furnished by God's creative power saved them from hunger, so by God's providence and care their raiment was marvelously kept from decay, and they had not to go barefoot from their sandals being worn out. Waxed not old upon thee; literally, <span class="accented">d</span>i<span class="accented">d not fall away</span>, <span class="accented">waste away from upon thee</span>. This cannot mean that such was the abundant supply of raiment to the Israelites in the Arabian desert, that there was no need for them to wear garments rent and tattered from long use, as they had large flocks and herds whence a sufficient supply of wool and leather could be obtained, and there were among them skilled artificers, by whom these could be made into articles of clothing (Rosenm&uuml;ller, J. D. Michaelis, etc.). For, as Knobel observes, "This were something too insignificant beside the miraculous manna; and besides, this does not lie in the expression, which rather intimates that the clothes upon them were not worn out nor fell from them in rags, because God gave them a marvelous durability." At the same time, there is no reason to suppose that the Israelites did not make use of such supplies as were within their reach for purposes of clothing, any more than that they lived only on manna during the forty years of their wandering. Still less need we resort to such fanciful suppositions as that the garments of the Israelitish children expanded as they grew up, like the shells of snails - which is the notion of some of the Jewish rabbins, and adopted by some of the Christian Fathers (see Deyling, 'Obss. Sacc.,' II. 17. p. 247). <span class="cmt_word">Neither did thy foot swell.</span> The verb here is found in only one other passage (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>), where this passage is repeated; and the meaning is doubtful. The LXX. render here by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">became callous</span>; but in Nehemiah the rendering they give is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">were torn</span>, the object torn being, according to the Cod. Vat., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">abbey</span>, <span class="accented">their feet</span>, according to the Cod. Alex., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>, <span class="accented">their sandals</span>. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>, the shoe or sandal is specially mentioned in the same connection as here. The verb, however, cannot mean tear or torn, neither does it mean swell; the idea involved is rather that of softening, or , melting or flowing; and the meaning here seems to be, "Thy foot did not get into a bruised and wounded state" - which would have been the case had their sandals not been preserved from breaking or being worn out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, <i>so</i> the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Thus God educated, disciplined, and trained his people as a father does his child. <span class="cmt_word">Chasteneth</span>. The idea is not so much that of <span class="accented">punishment</span> or <span class="accented">chastisement</span>, properly so called, as that of <span class="accented">severe discipline</span> and <span class="accented">training</span>. God made them feel his hand upon them, but ever for their good; the end of the discipline to which they were subjected was that they might keep his commandments and walk in his ways, so as to enjoy his favor (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>, etc.).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-20.</span> - The land on which they were about to enter is described as a good laud, fertile and well watered, and yielding abundant produce to its cultivators; and they are cautioned against forgetting, in their enjoyment of the gift, the bounty of the Giver, or congratulating themselves on having achieved the conquest of such a land, instead of gratefully acknowledging the grace which had sustained them during their protracted wandering in the wilderness, and by which alone they had been enabled to take possession of that favored land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brooks of water</span>, running streams, mountain torrents, and watercourses in the narrow valleys or wadys; fountains, perennial springs; <span class="cmt_word">depths</span>, "the fathomless pools from which such streams as the Abana (now Barada), near Damascus, spring up full-grown rivers, almost as broad at their sources as at their mouths" (Condor, 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 214), or this may include also the inland seas or lakes, such as the sea of Galileo and Lake Haleh. Palestine is in the present day, on the whole, well supplied with water, though the distribution is very unequal, many parts being almost wholly destitute of supply, except from what may be collected from rain in tanks or cisterns; and there is no reason to suppose it was different in the ancient times. As compared, however, with the desert to which the Israelites had been so long accustomed, and even with Egypt from which they had escaped, the country on which they were about to enter was well watered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - "Palestine has been celebrated in all ages for three products: corn, wine, and oil, which still continue to be its most valuable crops" (Ibid., p. 189). The principal corn crops were wheat and barley. The vine was largely and carefully cultivated; the olive required little cultivation, being almost a spontaneous growth, and forming one of the most valuable productions of the country; the fig was also indigenous in Palestine, and still grows there, both wild and cultivated, in abundance; that the pomegranate (<span class="accented">firemen</span>) also was very abundant may be inferred from the number of places named from this (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/21-13.htm">Judges 21:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Honey</span>.

Res.,' it. p. 442; Smith, Bib. Dict.,' s.v. 'Honey'). In the wilderness, the people had murmured that they had been brought into an evil place, no place of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; and where there was no water to drink (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-5.htm">Numbers 20:5</a>). Moses here tells them that the land they were about to occupy was not such a place, but one abounding in all those things of which they had found the wilderness so destitute.

Near Tiberius are springs largely impregnated with iron, as are also those at Has-beija, on the Hermon range, as well as the soil around that place. Traces of extinct copper works are also to be found on Lebanon (cf. art. 'Metals,' in Kitto and Smith; Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine,' 1:248). The Israelites, however, do not seem to have carried on mining operations themselves, but to have been content to obtain supplies of the useful metals from their neighbors (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-3.htm">1 Chronicles 22:3, 14</a>).
