At this point the language of address is exchanged for that of narrative. The change of subject from "ye abode" to "we turned," became necessary when Moses passed from exhorting and warning the people to narrating what happened after they resumed their journeyings; and gives no support to the notion of some recent German critics, that Moses left Kadesh with only a portion of the people, while the rest remained there, so that no entire departure of Israel from Kadesh ever took place - a notion which the whole tenor of the subsequent narrative contradicts. In obedience to the Divine command (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40</a>), the people, after tarrying for a while at Kadesh, took their departure and marched in the direction of the Yam-suph (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we compassed mount Seir many days.</span> These "many days" are the thirty-eight years during which the people wandered in the wilderness before they camped the second time at Kadesh; their going round Mount Seir, which was in Edom (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8, 9, 20</a>), is descriptive of their nomadic wanderings in various directions, west, south, and south-east of that mountain (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>). "Crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4, 5</a>), the Israelites issued into the great and elevated plains which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims on their way to Mecca; and appear to have followed <span class="accented">northward</span> nearly the same route which is now taken by the Syrian Hadgi along the western skirts of this great desert near the mountains of Edom" (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:253, 559). Mount Seir is now <span class="accented">Jebal</span> and <span class="accented">esh-Sherah</span>. This mountain range is a continuation of that which surrounds the eastern side of the Dead Sea. The details of this protracted wandering are passed over by Moses as not required by his purpose here.

As the Israelites, however, kept on the outskirts of their country, and did not attempt to penetrate into the interior, the Edomites did not attack them or seek to hinder their progress. The Israelites, on the other hand, were strictly forbidden to invade that country in a hostile manner; they were to watch over themselves, so as not to be tempted to make war on the Edomites, who were their brethren; as God would not give them any part, not so much as a foot-breadth, of that laud, for he had given Esau (i.e. the race descended from Esau, the Edomites - LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;</span>) Mount Seir for a possession. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be afraid of you</span> (see <a href="../../par/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>).

These Caphtorim were, like the Israelites, immigrants, who drove out the original occupants of the country; and on this account, probably, are referred to by Moses here. "This is so often repeated, to possess the minds of the Israelites with a sense of God's providence, which rules everywhere; displacing one people, and settling another in their stead, and fixing their bounds, also, which they shall not pass without leave" (Patrick).

Sihon and his people were Amorites, who had settled on the east of the Jordan in Gilead. But though not included in the original promise to Abraham, God had assigned this territory to the Israelites; and, therefore, he commanded the people under Moses to cross the Amen, and take the first step towards possessing the Promised Land, by assailing Sihon, King of Heshbon, assuring them that from that day he would "put the dread and fear of them upon all nations under the whole heaven," that is, all nations, wherever placed, to whom the fame of the Israelites should come (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a>), so that on hearing thereof, they should tremble and writhe as in pain (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). Moses, however, in the first instance, sent a message of peace to Sihon, proposing to pass through his territory on the same terms as he had made with the Moabites and Edomites, traveling by the highway, and paying for such provisions as his followers required. But this Sihon refused, and came out against Israel, with all his people, to battle. The issue was that he was utterly discomfited; all his towns were captured, he and all his people utterly destroyed, and the cattle and spoil of the whole country taken for booty. Israel thus became possessed of that entire territory, though it did not lie within the bounds of the land promised by God to Abraham, which was the reason, probably, why Moses made overtures of peace to Sihon, and would have passed through his country amicably, had he been permitted; but comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a>.

It is not to be supposed that any influence was <span class="accented">directly</span> exerted on him, to make him obdurate and persistent in his hostility to the people of God; the expression "he would not" indicates that it was of his own will that Sihon acted; but it was the will and purpose of God that Sihon should be destroyed, and his country taken by the Israelites, and so he was placed in circumstances by which, "given over to a reprobate mind," he was confirmed and strengthened m his determination to pursue a course which led to his destruction; like Pharaoh, by the circumstances in which God placed him, he found scope for the display and for the confirmation of a stubborn, pertinacious pride of spirit, which led ultimately to his ruin.
