When dispersed among the nations, if the people should return to Jehovah their God, he would again receive them into favor and gather them from their dispersion (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a>, etc.). Moses, looking into the future, anticipates that both the blessing and the curse would come upon the people according as they were faithful to their covenant engagement and obedient to God's Law, or were disobedient and unfaithful. But even when the curse came upon them to the full, this would not amount to final rejection; but God would, by the discipline of suffering, lead them to repentance, and then he would again bestow the blessing (cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-9.htm">Nehemiah 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt call them to mind</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>, where the same expression is rendered by "bethink themselves"). This is the meaning here also; it is not the mere recollection of the curse and the blessing that is referred to, but a general consideration of their own condition and conduct.

The rendering of the LXX. here is noticeable, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: "and the Lord will heal thy sins," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will remit thy guilt and will deliver thee from the pernicious and destructive power of sin (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-14.htm">Jeremiah 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-4.htm">Deuteronomy 30:4</a></div><div class="verse">If <i>any</i> of thine be driven out unto the outmost <i>parts</i> of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - Consequent on this deliverance would be the gathering of Israel from all the places of the dispersion and their return to possess the land which their fathers possessed, in greater numbers than their fathers were. This last statement suggests doubt as to the literal interpretation of this prediction, for, as Keil remarks, "If there is to be an increase in the num-bet of the Jews when gathered out of their dispersion into all the world, above the number of their fathers, and therefore above the number of the Israelites in the time of Solomon and the first monarchs of the two kingdoms, Palestine will never furnish room enough for a nation multiplied like this." The reference in the following verse to a spiritual renewal suggests the inquiry whether the reference here is not to such a gathering and restoration of Israel as that which St. Paul describes in <a href="../../par/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, when the branches that had been broken from the olive tree shall be again grafted into it, and all Israel shall be saved after the fullness of the Gentiles shall be, brought in. To Moses, and indeed to all the Old Testament prophets and saints, the Israel of God presented itself as a nation dwelling in a land given to it by God; but as the national Israel was the type of the spiritual Israel, and as Canaan was the type of the spiritual kingdom of God, the full import of what is said concerning the former is only to be perceived when it is viewed as realized in the latter. Certain it is that it was on this principle that the apostles interpreted the fulfillment of the Old Testament declarations concerning Israel, of which the explanation given by St. James of <a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11, 12</a> may be noted as an instructive example (<a href="../../par/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15-17</a>). If the rebuilding of the ruined tabernacle of David is to be effected by "the residue of men" being brought to "seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom his Name is called," we need not shrink from interpreting this prophecy of Moses as referring to the restoration of Israel by the bringing in of Jew and Gentile into the one fold under the one Shepherd, the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="../../par/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>).

When Israel should return to the Lord, he would take away from them the evil heart of unbelief, and give them the new heart and the right spirit. "Qui pravis affectibus renunciat is circumcisus corde dicitur" (Rosenm&uuml;ller. Cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 36:26; <a href="../../par/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).

These two verses are closely connected, the former expressing the condition on which the aspect expressed in the latter depends.
