Directions had been given for the construction of the ark before the apostasy of the people, and it was not made till after the tabernacle had been erected, nor were the tables placed in it till the tabernacle had been consecrated (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>, etc.; Exodus 40:20).

This Moses reminds the people of by referring to a fact in their past history, viz. their arrival at Mosera, where Aaron died, and Eleazar succeeded him in his office. <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth of the children of Jaakan</span> (<span class="accented">wells of the sons of Jaakan</span>); the same place as Bene-jaakan (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-31.htm">Numbers 33:31</a>), probably the Horite tribe, called 'Akan (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-27.htm">Genesis 36:27</a>), for which, apparently, should be read Jakan, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-42.htm">1 Chronicles 1:42</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Mosera</span>; Moseroth, plu. of Mosera (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-30.htm">Numbers 33:30</a>).

None of these places have been identified. Robinson mentions a Wady cf. Ghadaghidh, a broad sandy valley diverging from the Wady es Jerafeh, in the desert of Et-Tih, and this has been supposed to indicate the site of Gudgodah; but the difference of the consonants in the two words is such as to render this identification more than doubtful. In the Arabic of the London Polyglott, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span> is represented by  (<span class="accented">Judjuda</span>), which is totally different from <span class="accented">Ghadaghidh</span>. All the places, however, must have been in the 'Arabah, and in the region of Mount Her, or not far distant. That the places mentioned here are the same as those in Numbers cannot be doubted. The two passages, however, relate to different journeys; that in Numbers to the journeying of the Israelites from the wilderness of Sinai to Kadesh, that in Deuteronomy to the march in the fortieth year, when they went from Kadesh to Mount Her.

The appointment of the tribe of Levi for service took place in connection with that of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>). The service to which the tribe of Levi was chosen appertained to the tribe as such, including the priests as well as the non-priestly Levites, though parts of it specially belonged to the one class rather than the other. Thus the <span class="cmt_word">bearing of the ark</span> was the special duty of non-priestly Levites, the Kohathites (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15</a>); but was also, on peculiarly solemn occasions, discharged by the priests (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, etc.; Joshua 6:6; 8:33; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3, 6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To stand before the Lord to minister</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto him</span> was the special function of the priests (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-46.htm">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15, 16</a>); but as the service of the Levites was also a sacred service, they too are said to stand to minister before the Lord (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4, 5, 11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bless in his name</span> does not mean, as some propose, to invoke the Name of God, or to praise his Name, but to pronounce a benediction or invoke a blessing on the people in his Name (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a>). This was the special duty of the priests (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a>), but might also be done by others (as by David), and in this benediction the Levites might join (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>).

There is a fear with which love cannot coexist - a fear which hath torment, and which love casts out as its antagonist (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>); but the fear of God which he requires is that pious reverence which not only can coexist with love to him, but is not where love is not. <span class="cmt_word">And to serve the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</span> Love prompts to service.
