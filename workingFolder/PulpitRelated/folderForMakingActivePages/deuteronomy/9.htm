In the victory they had obtained over Sihon and Og, they had already had experience of the Lord's going before them, and leading them on in triumph.

There is no contradiction here of what is said in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; for there the reference is to the possession of the land by Israel, here it is to the destruction which was to come on the Canaanites - the former was to be by degrees, the latter was to come suddenly and overwhelmingly. <span class="cmt_word">As Jehovah hath said unto thee</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23, 27</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>, etc.).

The distinction between <span class="cmt_word">righteousness and uprightness</span> (straightness) of heart, is that the former (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;</span>) has reference to rectitude of conduct, the latter (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) to rectitude of motive and purpose. "By naming justice [righteousness], he excludeth all merit of works, and by righteousness [uprightness] of heart, all inward affections and purposes. which men might plead, notwithstanding that they fail in action.

Their rebellion began even before they had wholly escaped from their oppressors, before they had passed through the Bed Sea (Exodus  14:11). Even at Horeb, where, amid the most affecting manifestations alike of the Divine majesty and the Divine grace, just after the Lord had spoken to them directly out of the fire, and whilst Moses had gone up to receive the tables of the Law, on which the covenant of God with Israel was based, and whilst that covenant was being struck, they had sinned so grievously as to make to themselves a molten image, which they worshipped with idolatrous rites (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18-32:6</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12</a>, etc.).

In the account in Exodus nothing is said of Moses interceding for Aaron specially, as well as for the people generally; but prominence is given to this here, "not only that he might make the people thoroughly aware that at that time Israel could not boast even of the righteousness of its eminent men (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-27.htm">Isaiah 43:27</a>), but also to bring out the fact, which is described still more fully in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>., that Aaron's investiture with the priesthood and the maintenance of this institution was purely a work of Divine grace" (Keil).

"The list is not arranged chronologically, but advances from the smaller to the morn serious forms of guilt: For Moses was seeking to sharpen the consciences of the people, and to impress upon them the fact that they had been rebellious against the Lord (see at ver. 7) from the very beginning, 'from the day that I knew you'" (Keil).

Moses pleaded with God not to destroy that people which was his own, which he had redeemed for himself and brought out of Egypt; besought him to remember their pious ancestors, and not to look on the stubbornness and sin of the people; and urged that the Divine honor was concerned in their being conducted to Canaan, and not let perish in the wilderness.

Neither of these could be, for were they not the people of his inheritance, and had he not showed his power already in delivering them out of Egypt? As Moses in this chapter recalls to the remembrance of Israel this and that <span class="accented">place</span>, <span class="accented">time</span>, and <span class="accented">occasion</span> of their sinning, so should each one often seriously reflect on his past life.
