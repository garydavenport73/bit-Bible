The debt was to be <span class="accented">left</span> in the hands of the debtor, as the land was to be let lie or left untilled for that year.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3</a></div><div class="verse">Of a foreigner thou mayest exact <i>it again</i>: but <i>that</i> which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A foreigner</span>; a stranger of another nation, having no internal social relation to Israel (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), as distinguished from the stranger who lived among them and had claims on their benevolence (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>). Of such they might exact a debt, without regard to the year of release. "This rule breathes no hatred of foreigners, but simply allows the Israelites the right of every creditor to demand his debts and enforce the demand upon foreigners, even in the sabbatical year. There was no severity in this, because foreigners could get their ordinary income in the seventh year as well as in any other" (Keil). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-4.htm">Deuteronomy 15:4</a></div><div class="verse">Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance to possess it:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Save when there shall be no poor among you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">only that there shall be no poor among you</span>; q.d., this ordinance is not intended to prevent creditors seeking the payment of their just debts, but only to prevent there being poor in the land. The reason assigned is that the Lord would greatly bless them in the land which he had given them, so that the creditor would be no loser by refraining from exacting his debt from his brother in the seventh year. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-5.htm">Deuteronomy 15:5</a></div><div class="verse">Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - This blessing, though promised and certified, should come only if they were careful to observe and do all that God commanded them. The <span class="cmt_word">for</span> at the beginning of ver. 6 connects this with ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt lend.</span> The verb in Kal signifies to borrow on a pledge; in Hiph. to lend on a pledge, as here; it is a denominative from the Hebrew noun signifying <span class="accented">pledge</span>.

They were not to harden their hearts against their poorer brethren, nor were they, in the prospect of the year of release, to refuse to lend them what was necessary for their uses, but, on the contrary, were to open their heart and their hand to them according to their need, lest the poor should appeal against them to God, and sin should lie upon them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Harden thine heart</span>; literally, <span class="accented">maize strong</span>, so as to suppress natural compassion and sympathy.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a></div><div class="verse">Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A thought in thy wicked heart</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a thing in thy heart worthlessness</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a thing which is worthless and unworthy. The word used is <span class="accented">belial</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>), which does not denote that which is wicked so much as that which is worthless. Thus, "a man of Belial" is a worthless fellow -  not necessarily a wicked man (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And it be sin unto thee</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. entail guilt upon thee, and so expose thee to the Divine displeasure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-10.htm">Deuteronomy 15:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be grieved</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall not become evil</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. shall not entertain a grudge. They were to give, not grudgingly or of necessity, merely through dread of God's displeasure, but cheerfully and spontaneously (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). For this God would bless them in all their works, so that they should not only be no losers, but should be gainers, by their generosity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a></div><div class="verse">For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - They were to open their hand wide to their poorer brethren, for there should always be such in the land. This statement is not inconsistent with that in ver. 4, for there it is the prevention of poverty by not dealing harshly with the poor that is spoken of; here it is the continuance of occasion for the relief of the poor that is referred to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - From injunctions regarding the treatment of the poor and of debtors the transition is easy to the law concerning slaves, inasmuch as it was through the stress of poverty that any became such from among their brethren. The law, as here laid down, is the same as that in <a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>, somewhat expanded; the most important addition being that the slave is not only to go free after six years of service, but is to be furnished by his master with the means of setting up a home for himself. The six years here specified are not to be confounded with the years ending at the sabbatical year; they are any six years during which the individual has been in bondage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-13.htm">Deuteronomy 15:13</a></div><div class="verse">And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</div><div class="comm">

The meaning is well expressed in the Authorized Version. This is the new prescription added to the earlier law. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Compliance is enforced by the consideration that the Israelites had been themselves bondmen in Egypt, and had been redeemed out of that bondage by God (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-19.htm">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-12.htm">Deuteronomy 16:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-18.htm">Deuteronomy 24:18, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>). As God had dealt by them, so it behooved them to deal by others in like condition and need. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-16.htm">Deuteronomy 15:16</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - It might happen, however, that the slave chose rather to remain with his master than to be manumitted, and in that case he was not to be forced to go free, which would be a hardship to him, but was to be, by a formal process of nailing his ear to the door of his master's house, constituted his slave for life (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/21-5.htm">Exodus 21:5</a>). This was not a painful operation, especially as the servant's ear was probably already pierced for a ring; nor does any infamy appear to have been attached to the bearing of this badge of perpetual servitude. There is no mention here, as in Exodus, of the matter being referred to the judges; and this has led some to suppose that, by the time this later prescription was given, the earlier usage had passed away; but it is more natural to suppose that this usage was so regular and well known that it was needless formally to announce it.

It is enjoined that, as all the firstborn were to be sanctified to the Lord (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2-13</a>), they were not to work with the firstborn of their cattle, either by yoking the bullock to the plough or wagon or by shearing the sheep: these belonged to God, and were not to be put to any vulgar uses of men; year by year they were to be brought to the sanctuary, offered as sacrifices, and eaten before the Lord. If any of the firstborn animals were blind, or lame, or in any way blemished, such was not to be offered to the Lord, but might be used as food in their ordinary places of residence (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
