The meaning is not that he "went away" into the tent of teaching, as one of the Targums explains it (London Polyglot, tom. 4. p. 377), which does not agree with what follows; nor is "went" merely equivalent to "moreover;" nor is it simply redundant; - it intimates that the speaking was consequent on Moses having arranged, disposed, or set himself to speak (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a>).

This does not conflict with the statement in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, that up to the time of his death his eyes were not dim nor his natural strength abated, for this is the statement of an observer, and it often happens that an individual feels himself to be failing, when to those around him he appears to possess unabated vigor. There is no need, therefore, for resorting, with Raschi and others, to the expedient of reading "for" instead of "and" in the following clause; as if the cause why Moses could no longer go in and out among the people was God's prohibition of his going over Jordan. This is simply another and collateral reason why he had now to retire flora his post as leader.

The Law was committed to the priests and elders, not merely to preserve it in safe keeping, but that they might see to its being observed by the people; else why commit it to the elders whose it was to administer rule in the nation, as well as <span class="accented">to</span> the priests who alone had access to the ark of the covenant where the Law was deposited? Moses "entrusted the reading to the priesthood and the college of elders, as the spiritual and secular rulers of the congregation; and hence the singular, Thou shalt read this Law to all Israel" (Keil). By the Law here is meant the Pentateuch; but it does not necessarily follow that the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the Pentateuch was to be thus read. As the reading was to be only once in seven years, it may be concluded that it was not so much for the information of the people that this was done, as for the purpose of publicly declaring, and by a solemn ceremony impressing on their minds the condition on which they held their position and privileges as the chosen people of the Lord; and for this the reading of select portions of the Torah would be sufficient. The Feast of Tabernacles was appointed as the season for the reading, <span class="accented">doubtless</span> because <span class="accented">there</span> was a <span class="accented">connection</span> between the end for which the Law was read and the spirit and meaning of that festival as a festival of rejoicing because of their deliverance from the uncertainty and unsettledness of their state in the wilderness, and their establishment in a well-ordered state where they could in peace and quietness enjoy the blessings which the bounty of God bestowed. <span class="cmt_word">When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt read this law</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/8-34.htm">Joshua 8:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, etc.).

At the same time, God announced to Moses that after his death the people would go astray, and turn to idolatry, and violate the covenant, so that God's anger should be kindled against them, and he would leave them to suffer the consequences of their folly and sin. In view of this, Moses was directed to write a song and teach it to the people, that it might abide with them as a witness against them, rising up, as songs will do, in the memory of the nation, even after they had apostatized from the path in which the author of the song had led them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of the congregation</span>; properly, <span class="accented">the tent of meeting</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-32.htm">Exodus 39:32</a>).

This was the finishing of the writing of the Book of the Law, and the committing it finally to the priests, to be by them placed by the ark of the covenant, that it might be kept for all future generations as a witness against the people, whose apostasy and rebellion were foreseen. Whether this section is to be regarded as wholly written by Moses himself, or as an appendix to his writing added by some other writer, has been made matter of question. It is quite possible, however, that Moses himself, ere he laid down the pen, may have recorded what he said when delivering the Book of the Law to the priests, and there is nothing in the manner or style of the record to render it probable that it was added by another. What follows from ver. 30 to the end of the book was probably added to the writing of Moses by some one after his death, though, of course, both the song in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, and  the blessing in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, are the composition of Moses (see Introduction, &sect; 6).

On special occasions the priests themselves carried the ark (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>, etc.; Joshua 4:9, 10; 6:6, 12; 8:33; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>).
