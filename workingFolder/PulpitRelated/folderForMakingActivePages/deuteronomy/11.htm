Moses does not mention Korah himself here, but only his accomplices Dathan and Abiram, probably, as Keil suggests, "from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah;" perhaps also because, though Korah was at the head of the insurrection, Dathan and Abiram were the more determined, audacious, and obdurate in their rebellion (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12-15, 25, 26</a>), so that it came to be named from them.

Canaan was not like Egypt, a country that depended for its fertility on being irrigated by man's labor or by artificial processes, but was a land where the supply and distribution of water was provided for in natural reservoirs and channels, by means of which the rain which God, who cared for the land, sent plentifully on it, was made available for useful purposes. In Egypt there is little or no rain, and the people are dependent on the annual overflowing of the Nile for the proper irrigation of their fields; and as this lasts only for a short period, the water has to be stored and redistributed by artificial means, often of a very laborious kind. Wateredst it with thy foot. "The reference, perhaps, is to the manner of conducting the water about from plant to plant and from furrow to furrow. I have often watched the gardener at this fatiguing and unhealthy work. When one place is sufficiently saturated, he pushes aside the sandy soil between it and the next furrow with his foot, and thus continues to do until all are watered. He is thus knee-deep in mud, and many are the diseases generated by this slavish work. Or the reference may be to certain kinds of hydraulic machines which were turned by the feet. I have seen small water-wheels, on the plain of Acre and elsewhere, which were thus worked; and it appeared to me to be very tedious and toilsome, and, if the whole country had to be irrigated by such a process, it would require a nation of slaves like the Hebrews, and taskmasters like the Egyptians, to make it succeed. Whatever may have been the meaning of Moses, the Hebrews no doubt had learned by bitter experience what it was <span class="accented">to water with the foot</span>; and this would add great force to the allusion, and render doubly precious the goodly land which drank of the rain of heaven, and required no such drudgery to make it fruitful" (Thomson, ' The Land and the Book,' 2:279; edit. Lend. 1859). Philo describes a machine cf. this sort as in use in Egypt ('De Confus. Linguar.,' Opp. 1:410, edit. Mangey); and in that country, "a garden of herbs" is still generally watered by means of a machine of simple construction, consisting of a wheel, round which revolves an endless rope to which buckets are attached; this is worked by the feet of a man seated on a piece of wood fastened by the side of the machine, labor at once monotonous and severe (Niebuhr, 'Voyage en Arabic,' 1:121, 4to, Amst. 1776; 'Description de l'Arabic,' 1:219, 4to, Paris, 1779; Robinson, 'Bib. lies.,' 1:542; 2:21).

It was a land on which Jehovah's regard was continually fixed, over which he watched with unceasing care, and which was sustained by his bounty; a land, therefore, wholly dependent on him, and so a fitting place for a people also wholly dependent on him, who owed to his grace all that they were and had.

The two mountains named stand opposite to each other, with a valley between, about two hundred yards broad at the widest part, in which stood the town of Shechem, now Nablus. They were selected for the purpose mentioned, doubtless, because of their relative position, and probably also because they stand in the center of the land both from north to south, and from east to west. It has been suggested that Ebal was appointed for the uttering of the curse, and Gerizim for the uttering of the blessing, because the former was barren and rugged, the latter fertile and smooth; but this is not borne out by the actual appearance of the two bills, both being equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation. That Gerizim was selected for the blessing because of its position on the south side of the valley "towards the region of light," while Ebal was appointed for the curse because it was on the north side, can be regarded only as an ingenious fancy. In ver. 30, the position of the two mountains is defined as <span class="cmt_word">on the other side of Jordan</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. on the side opposite to where the Israelites then were, the western side; and as <span class="cmt_word">by the way</span> - rather, <span class="accented">behind the way - <span class="cmt_word"></span>where the sun goeth down</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the road of the west, the great road which passed through the west-Jordan country, and which is still the main route from south to north in Palestine (Ritter, 4:293, etc.; Robinson, 3:127), passing Nablus and the two menu-rains on the east, so that they are <span class="accented">behind</span> it. <span class="cmt_word">Which dwell in the Champaign</span>; in the 'Arabah (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>), "mentioned here as that portion of the land on the west of the Jordan which lay stretched out before the eyes of the Israelites, who were encamped in the steppes of Moab" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Over against Gilgal</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>, which was east of Jericho (<span class="accented">hod</span>. Jiljulia), nor the Gilgal of <a href="../../par/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a> (probably the modern Jiljulieh, in the plain of Sharon), but the Gilgal of <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6</a>; and <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a> (<span class="accented">hod</span>. Jiljilia), to the north of Bethel, from which there is "a very extensive prospect over the great lower plain, and also over the sea" (Robinson, 'Bib. Res,' 3:138); so that the mountains by Nablus may be very well described as "over against it." <span class="cmt_word">Beside the plains of Moreh</span>; for "plains" read <span class="accented">oaks</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>).
