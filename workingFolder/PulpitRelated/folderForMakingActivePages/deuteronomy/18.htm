"This right was probably accorded to the priests as a compensation for the falling off which would take place in their incomes in consequence of the repeal of the law that every animal was to be slaughtered at the sanctuary as a sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17.htm">Leviticus 17</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>. <span class="accented">sqq</span>.)"(<span class="accented">Keil</span>). According to Josephus ('Antiq ,' 4:4, 4), Philo ('De Praemiis. Sacerdot.,' p. 832, Opp., tom. 2. p. 235, edit. Maugey), the Talmud, etc., this injunction relates to the slaying of animals at home for private use, and not such as were killed for sacrifice. But the use here of the sacrificial phraseology, <span class="cmt_word">who offer a sacrifice</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, who slay victims for sacrifice - a phrase nowhere found except in connection with sacrificial rites) is adverse to this; and besides, how could such an enactment be carried out? How could people, residing at a distance, convey to the priests the portions due to them every time they slaughtered an animal for domestic use? At the same time, the sacrifices here referred to do not seem to be included in the offerings by fire above mentioned; and these gifts to the priest seem to have been something over and above his ordinary dues. There is probability, therefore, in the suggestion that "the reference is to the slaughtering of oxen, sheep, or goats, which were not intended for <span class="accented">shelamim</span> in the more limited sense, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for one of the three species of peace offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15, 16</a>), but for festal meals in the broader sense, which were held in connection with the sacrificial meals prepared from the <span class="accented">shelamim"</span> (Keil).

In this respect his place could be supplied neither by priest nor by king. In the prospect of his demise, therefore, there required to be instituted another office, that of a prophet, one who should be between God and the people, as the channel through which Divine communications might pass to them. This office Moses here announces that God would establish among them when they had entered the Promised Land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The abominations of these nations</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. certain forms of superstitious usage by which the heathen sought to procure the favor of their deities, to obtain from them direction and counsel, and to penetrate into the hidden future of events.

The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>) is part of a verb which signifies to cover, to use covert arts, to practice sorcery; though some derive it from the noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, a thick cloud, and explain it as "interpreter of clouds;" while others trace it to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, the eye, and explain it as "one who cheats by optical fascinations" (so the Syriac, <span class="accented">fascinans oculis</span>), or one who divines by inspection - an augur." <span class="cmt_word">An enchanter</span>; one who practices magic, or divines by signs (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-1.htm">Numbers 24:1</a>). It is sometimes said that the verb of which this word is a part (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, a serpent; whence it is inferred that the species of divination indicated by this word is <span class="accented">ophiomancy</span>, or divination by serpents, but this is not generally accepted by scholars. <span class="cmt_word">A witch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">maleficus</span>); probably one who pretended to cure diseases, or procure some desired result, by means of nostrums and philtres. In the enumeration of the wise men of Babylon (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), the Mecashephim have a place beside the Hartummim, and in <a href="../../par/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a> and <a href="../../par/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, they are joined with the Hachamim or Magi of Egypt; and this favors the conclusion that their sorcery had a quasi-scientific basis. The English word "witch" is now restricted to the <span class="accented">female</span> practicer of unlawful arts; formerly it was applied to <span class="accented">males</span> as well, if not chiefly (Trench, 'Select Glossary,' p. 806). <span class="cmt_word">A charmer</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>); a dealer in spells, one who by means of spells or charms pretends to achieve some desired result. The verb here used primarily means to bind, and the species of magic indicated is probably that practiced by binding certain knots, whereby it was supposed that the curse or blessing, as the case might he, was bound on its object; this was accompanied apparently with incantation (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>). Comp. English <span class="accented">spell-bound</span>, and the phrase, "to rivet charms" (Jonson, 'Sad Shepherd,' 2:2). A species of incantation known to the Romans consisted in tying knots with threads of different colors, three in number, which were supposed to become a bond to secure an object (cf. Virg., 'Eclog.' 8:76, 77). <span class="cmt_word">A consulter with familiar spirits.</span> This phrase conveys something different from what is expressed, in the Hebrew. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> is one who asks or inquires of an Ob, that is, a Python, or divining spirit. This spirit was supposed to be in the person of the conjurer, and to be able to reveal to him what was secret or hidden in the future (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>). The notion of "a familiar spirit," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a spirit not dwelling in the person, but with which he is intimate - generally the spirit of one who formerly lived on earth - is a modern notion not known to Scripture. The persons here referred to were probably ventriloquists (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and used their faculty in this respect for purposes of magic, pretending that they had within them a spirit which they could consult, and by which they could predict what would happen or reveal what was hid. <span class="cmt_word">Wizard</span>. The English word "wizard" did not originally convey the idea of anything evil in the person of whom it was used; Milton applies it to the Magi who came to worship at Bethlehem ('Ode on the Nativity,' 4.); it meant merely "the wise one," or "the knowing one;" and thus is an exact equivalent for the Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, knowing, wise, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, to know). <span class="cmt_word">A necromancer</span>; one who professed to call up the dead, and from them to learn the secrets of futurity (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>). (See on all these names the learned and copious dissertation of Dr. Holmes, art. 'Divination,' in Kitto's 'Bibl. Cyclop.,' 3rd. edit., 1:682.)

Hence Abraham is called a prophet (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>), and the term is applied to the patriarchs generally (<span class="accented">Psalm</span> 105:15); God conveyed his mind to them, and they spoke it forth to others (cf. <span class="accented">Amos</span> 3:7). <span class="cmt_word">Like unto me.</span> When the people heard the voice of God speaking to them at Sinai, and from the midst of the fire uttering to them the Ten Words, they were struck with terror, and besought that they might not again hear that awful voice, but that Moses might act as mediator between God and them - might hear what God should <span class="accented">say</span>, and speak it unto them (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-27</a>).

For the latter the context strongly speaks, for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the contrast between what God here forbids the Israelites to do, viz. to resort to diviners and soothsayers, and the provision he would make for them so as to render this needless, point to a succession of prophets rather than to one individual; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the reference in what follows to the discrimination of false prophets from true prophets, shows that a multiplicity and a succession of prophets was in the view of the speaker, not a single individual; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as a succession of priests, of judges, and of kings was contemplated in this part of the Mosaic legislation, the presumption is that a succession also of prophets was contemplated. At the same time, the use of the singular here is remarkable, for nowhere else is the singular, <span class="accented">nabhi</span>, employed to designate more than one individual; and this <span class="accented">suggests</span> that the reference here may be to some individual in whom not only was the succession to culminate as in its crown and eminence, but whose spirit was to pervade the whole succession, - that each member of it should exercise his functions only as that Spirit which was in them did signify (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>). It is possible also, as Oryon Gerlach has suggested, that "Prophet" here may be used as "<span class="accented">seed"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, and that this is a prediction of Christ as the True Prophet, just as the assurance to Eve was a prediction of the Messiah, who, as the Head and Crown of the" godly seed," should end the conflict with the serpent and his seed by a crushing victory. It is to be considered also that, whilst the words "like unto me" do not necessarily imply a resemblance in <span class="accented">all</span> respects between Moses and the Prophet here promised, and whilst they may be well applied to One superior in many respects to Moses, it would be taking them at much below their real worth were we to understand them of one greatly inferior to Moses, as all the prophets who succeeded him in Israel were until the Chief came (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>). Finally, there can be no doubt that the Jews expected that the Messiah would appear as the Prophet by pre-eminence, and that they founded that expectation on the promise here recorded (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22-26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-37.htm">Acts 7:37</a>). It may be added that our Lord seems to apply this to himself, when he says to the Jews, "There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me" (<a href="../../par/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45, 46</a>; cf. also John 11:48-50). How early and how widespread was the expectation that the Messiah would come as a prophet, may be inferred from the existence of this among the Samaritans (<a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>). It is to be concluded, then, that this promise has reference ultimately to the Messiah, the Great Revealer of God, between whom and Moses there should be a long succession of prophets, so that there should always be a medium of Divine communication between Jehovah and his people.

The reference here is to the prediction of proximate events - events that were to happen within a limited period, but which were not such as one not divinely instructed could foresee. When such came to pass, the pretensions of the prophet were thereby substantiated, and his authority established (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>, etc.).
