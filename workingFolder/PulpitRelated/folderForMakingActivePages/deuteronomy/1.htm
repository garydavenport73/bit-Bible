But it seems more natural to refer it to what follows - to the addresses in this book. The pronoun these (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) may be used with a prospective reference, as well as with a retrospective (cf. e.g. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>). The author does not by this connect this book with the preceding, but rather distinguishes it. The subscription to Numbers (<a href="../../par/numbers/36-13.htm">Numbers 36:13</a>) indicates that what precedes is occupied chiefly with what God spake to Moses; the inscription here intimates that what follows is what Moses spake to the people. This is the characteristic of Deuteronomy. <span class="cmt_word">Unto all Israel.</span> It cannot be supposed that Moses spoke to the whole multitude of the people so as to be heard by them. Hence the Jewish interpreters say that he spoke to the elders of the people, who carried his words to the people at large. This is just; for what was thus mediately communicated to the people might be fairly described as spoken to them; and we find from other passages in the Pentateuch that the phrase, "the elders of Israel," in the mind of the writer, was equivalent to "the congregation of Israel" (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a> with ver. 21; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a> with ver. 5). But through whatever medium conveyed, it was to the people that these words were addressed; this is emphatically a book for the people. <span class="cmt_word">On this side Jordan.</span> This should be <span class="accented">On the other side</span> or <span class="accented">beyond Jordan</span>, and so also in ver. 5, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20, 25</a>. The word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) means properly something beyond, over, or across, and indicates that which, to the speaker, lies on the <span class="accented">other</span> side of some line or limit. When coupled with "the Jordan," it usually indicates the region to the <span class="accented">east</span> of that river; only in one or two instances, where the speaker takes his standpoint on the east of the river, does it designate the regions to the west of Jordan (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-25.htm">Deuteronomy 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>) The phrase "beyond Jordan" seems to have been the established designation of the region east of the Jordan (cf. <a href="../../par/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a>, and Canon Rawlinson's note there). It is this, unquestionably, which is here so designated, as what follows expressly shows. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness.</span> This term is used of any extensive district not occupied by inhabitants or subjected to culture; hence of vast prairies or pasturelands, as well as of places properly desert and desolate. It here denotes the grassy plains or downs on the east and southeast of the Jordan, in the land of Moab (ver. 5). <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>; in the Arabah. This is properly the whole of that remarkable depression which stretches from the source  of the Jordan on to Akabah, or the Ailanitic Gulf; but here it is only that part of it which extends from the south end of the Dead Sea to Allah (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>). This part still bears the name of the 'Arabah, the northern part being known as the Ghor (Smith's 'Dictionary,' vol. 1. p. 87; Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' vol. 1. p. 178). <span class="cmt_word">Over against the Red sea.</span> The name by which the Red Sea is elsewhere designated is <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span>); here only the latter word occurs, and this has led some to doubt if the Red Sea be here intended. Patrick, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others suggest that <span class="accented">Suph</span> denotes some place in that region, probably Suphah (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>, margin, Authorized Version), <span class="accented">so</span> called because lying at its extremity, as the verb <span class="accented">suph</span>, from which it comes, means, to come to an end; but it is not certain that Suphah designates a place in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;</span> means a tempest or whirlwind; and this meaning may be assumed here, as it is by Gesenius, Keil, and others: "Waheb [he conquered] in a storm." Knobel suggests that probably the pass now called Es Sufah, on the north side of the Wady Murreh - the Maleh-acrabbim (Scorpion-ascent) of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a> - is meant; others have suggested Zephath (<a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), and others Zuph (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>). It is probable, however, that <span class="accented">Suph</span> is here merely a breviloquence for <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span>, the Red Sea; and so all the ancient versions take it. The identification of the <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span> of the Old Testament with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> of the Greeks, the <span class="accented">mare erythraeum</span>, or <span class="accented">rubrum</span>, of the Latins, is due to the LXX., which other versions have followed. The identification is undoubtedly correct (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/33-10.htm">Numbers 33:10</a> and <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>). <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span>, indeed, means simply sea of weeds, and might be the name of any sea in which algae are found; but these passages clearly prove that by this the Hebrews designated the Red Sea. At what part of this sea the Israelites crossed, and the hosts of Pharaoh were submerged, is and must remain uncertain, because we know not what was the condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus. It is probable it was not at any part of what is now known as the Red Sea or Gulf of Suez. Brugsch Bey places it at that - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Serbonian bog<br />Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old,<br />Where armies whole have sunk."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Milton, 'Paradise Lost,'Bk. 2:592.</span>) But this has not been accepted by scholars generally (see <span class="accented">Edinburgh Review</span>, No. 307; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 247; <span class="accented">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, July and October, 1880). It seems probable that originally only a marshy district lay between the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean; and somewhere in this probably the passage of the Israelites and the drowning of the Egyptians occurred. <span class="cmt_word">Between Paran, and Tophel</span>, etc. This serves more fully and particularly to indicate the locality here intended; but the details present considerable difficulty. Taken in connection with the words "over against the lied <span class="accented">sea</span>," the names here given can only be regarded as intended more precisely to indicate the region in which the Israelites had been during the forty years of their wandering. <span class="accented">Paran</span>: this is the name of the wilderness bordering on Idumea, where the Israelites encamped (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>); the place of their encampment being Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21, 26</a>), which was the eastern part of the wilderness of Paran. <span class="accented">hod</span>. Wady Murreh. The wilderness of Paran corresponds in general outline with the desert of Et-Tih. This is a vast plateau of irregular surface stretching from the Et-Tih range northwards to the boundaries of the Holy Land, and from the Gulf of Akabah and the Wady cf. Arabah on the east to the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean on the west. It is described as "a chalky formation, the chalk being covered with coarse gravel, mixed with black flints and drifting sand;" not, however, wholly sterile: in many parts vegetation abounds, considerable portions are under cultivation, and there are evidences that it one time water was abundant there (Smith, 2:767; Kitto, 3:1077; Drew, 'Scripture Lands,' p. 80). It is not, however, to the wilderness of Paran that the reference is in the text, but to some definite locality or spot in the region in which the Israelites then were, or which they had recently passed through. It has been suggested that the place now called Feiran, and where there are the ruins of a town, once of some importance in the early history of Christianity, is the Paran of this passage, as it apparently is the Paran of <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>. But this locality at the base of Jebel Serbail is much too far west to be the Paran here referred to. More probable is the suggestion that it is the Faran mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome ('Onomast.,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>), a city to the cast (northeast) of Allah or Elath, about three days' journey (Reland, 'Palest.,' p. 556; Winer, 'Realworterbuch,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. Pharan). <span class="accented">Tophel</span>: this name occurs only here; it is supposed to be the place now coiled Tufailah or Tafyleh, a large village of six hundred inhabitants, between Bozrah and Kerak, on the eastern slope of the mountains of Edom (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 402; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 2:570). As this is a place where the Syrian caravans are supplied with  provisions, it has been conjectured that the Israelites, when at Oboth (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10, 11</a>), may have resorted to it for a supply, and that it was here that they purchased meat and drink from the children of Esau (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Laban.</span> <span class="accented">Laban</span> is generally identified with Libnah, the second place of encampment of the Israelites on their return from Kadesh (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-20.htm">Numbers 33:20, 21</a>). Knobel, however, thinks it is the place called by Ptolemy '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, lying between Petra and Allah; this name, from the Arabic  (he was white), having the same meaning as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Hazeroth</span> is supposed to be the place mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/11-35.htm">Numbers 11:35</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>, from which the Israelites entered the wilderness of Paran; but as the other places here mentioned are on the east side of the Arabah, it is not probable that this Hazeroth is the same as that of Numbers, which must have been not far from Sinai, in a northerly or north-westerly direction from that mountain, probably at or near to the fountain now called El Hudherah (Wilson, 'Lands of the Bible,' 1:235; Kitto, 'Cyclopedia,' 2:243). There were probably several places bearing the name of <span class="accented">Hazeroth</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. villages. <span class="cmt_word">Dizahab</span>. This is generally identified with Dhahab, a place on a tongue of land in the Gulf of Akabah. But it is extremely improbable that the Israelites ever were at this place, the approach to which is exceedingly difficult; and the mere resemblance of the names Dizahab and Dhahab is not sufficient to prove the identity of the places. There were probably more places than one which were named from <span class="accented">zahab</span> (gold) in the region traversed by the Israelites. There is a Dhahab on the east of the Jordan near the Zerka or Jabbok, a double mound, which is said to derive its name from the yellowish color of the sandstone rock of which it consists, and which is metalliferous. In the Arabic of the Polyglot, Dizahab appears as <span class="accented">Dhi-dhahab</span>, which signifies "<span class="accented">auro</span> <span class="accented">praeditum</span> vel <span class="accented">ab auro dictum</span>; <span class="accented">nam</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> vel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span>, apud Arabes in compositione nominum propr. idem est ac Hebrews <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> (J. H. Michaelis). There is a various reading here, <span class="accented">Di-waheb</span>, and this has been supposed to connect this place with the Waheb of <a href="../../par/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>. But, as above noted, it is by no means certain that Waheb is there the name of a place; it may, as Bishop Patrick suggests, be that of a man, some hero or chief, who was conquered in Sufah or in a storm. Waheb is a name among the Arabs. The maternal grandfather of Me-hammed had this name (Abul-Pharaj, 'Hist. Dynast.,' p. 161, edit. Pococke, Oxen., 1663); and the sect of the Wahabees take their name from Abdul Wahab, a fanatic who appeared about the beginning of last century. The words "between Paran and Tophel" have been taken to indicate' the termini of the wanderings; at the commencement of these the people were at Paran, and towards the close of them they were at Tophel. '"Looking from the steppes of Moab over the ground that the Israelites had traversed, Suph, where they first entered the desert of Arabia, would lie between Paran where the congregation arrived at the borders of Canaan toward the west, and Tophel where they first ended their desert wanderings thirty-seven years later on the east" (Keil). But this assumes that Paran here is the wilderness of Paran. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">(<i>There are</i> eleven days' <i>journey</i> from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Horeb</span>. The name generally given to Sinai in Deuteronomy (see introduction, &sect; 4). Sinai, however, occurs in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> of this book. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of mount Seir</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by the way that leads to Mount Seir; just as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>, "the way of the Red sea" is the way that leads to that sea (see also <a href="../../par/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>). <span class="accented">Mount</span> is here, as often elsewhere, for <span class="accented">mountain range</span>. The mountain range here referred to seems to have been, not that on the east of the 'Arabah, but what is in vers. 6 and 19 called "the mountain of the Amorites," "the Seir by Hormah" of ver. 44, i e. the southern part of what was afterwards called the mountains of Judah. According to ver. 19, the Israelites, when they left Horeb, passed through the wilderness along the way that led to the mountains of the Amorites, and came to Kadesh-barnea. Kadesh must, therefore, be looked for, not on the eastern side of the 'Arabah, but somewhere in the wilderness of Zin. It has been identified with the place now known as 'Ain Kudes, near the northern extremity of Jebel Halal, and to the east of that hill; but this is far from being certain. Moses reminds the Israelites that the distance between Horeb and Kadesh is eleven days - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, about one hundred and sixty-five miles, the day's journey being reckoned at fifteen miles - not to give them a piece of information, but rather to suggest to them how, in consequence of rebellion, a journey which might have been so easily accomplished, had been protracted through many wearisome years. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-3.htm">Deuteronomy 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - Here is intimated the <span class="accented">time</span> when the following addresses were delivered to the people. It was on the first day of the eleventh month in the fortieth year; therefore near the end of their wanderings, and towards the close of the lawgiver's own career. He could thus speak to them <span class="cmt_word">according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in accordance with the legislative contents of the preceding books (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a> 23; 5:28-33; 6:1). It was also after the destruction of Sihon and 'Og (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). This also is significant. By the destruction of these kings, who sought to bar the access of the Israelites to the Promised Land, God had given proof that he would indeed fulfill his promise to his people, and had at once laid them under obligations to obedience, and given them encouragement to go forward on the course to which he had called them. The "he" here is Moses, who, at the command of God, had led the Israelites against Sihon and 'Og. Edrei, <span class="accented">hod</span> Draa (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>) was the second capital of 'Og; he "reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei" (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-12.htm">Joshua 13:12</a>). Here, however, it denotes the place where he was slain in battle, and the words "in Edrei" are to be referred to the verb "smote" and not to "dwelt" (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>: <a href="../../par/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>).

Res.," 2:569). <span class="cmt_word">Began</span>; rather <span class="accented">set himself to</span>. The Hebrew word signifies to undertake, to betake one's self to, and so to begin It is variously rendered in the Authorized Version (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/18-27.htm">Genesis 18:27</a>, "taken it upon me;" <a href="../../par/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>, "was content," had made up his mind; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>, "it pleased;" 17:39,"assayed," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To declare</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. make clear, explain, expound (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>, "make plain "). The Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) signifies primarily to cut or dig, then to cut into, to grave, and then to cut or dig out so as to make evident, to declare, to make plain. What Moses set himself to do, then, was not to publish a new law, but to make plain to the people the Law already promulgated, to set forth clearly and pointedly what they were required by the Law to be and to do. This explains more fully the "spake" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) of ver. 3. This exposition of the Law was designed specially for the sake of those who, at the time the Law was first promulgated, either were not born or were incapable of understanding it (Grotius). The expression used by Moses plainly indicates that this book was not intended to furnish a second code of laws different from the former, but simply to explain and enforce what had before been enjoined.

The use of this epithet implies the covenant union of Israel with Jehovah, and presupposes the existence of that covenant which was entered into at Sinai. <span class="cmt_word">In Horeb</span>.

There he made himself known to them as Jehovah, the Eternal and Unchangeable, and entered into covenant with them; and there they received that Law, on the keeping of which depended their retention of the privileges to which they had been elected. At Horeb the Israelites had remained for about a year (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>. I and <a href="../../par/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11, 12</a>), and as the purpose for which they had been brought thither was answered, they were enjoined to move, not indeed by express command, but by the rising of the cloud from over the tabernacle, which was the signal of their march (<a href="../../par/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, etc.; Numbers 10:11-13), preceded by the instructions they had received preparatory to their removal (Numbers 50:4-7). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount.</span> The Israelites remained at Sinai from the third month of the first year to the twentieth day of the second year after they came  out of Egypt (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>).

The mountain range of the Amorites, afterwards called the hill country of Judah and Ephraim, was the object which would first strike the view of one advancing from the south; and so, it stands here for the whole land of Canaan, with which it is in this context identified. Those "that dwell thereon" are the inhabitants of the whole of Canaan. The Amorites (Hebrew <span class="accented">Emori</span>, so called from Amor, or Emor) oftener than once appear as standing for the Canaanites generally (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20, 21</a>, etc.). That all the inhabitants of Canaan are intended here is evident from the specification of the different districts of the land of Canaan which immediately follows. <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>: the '<span class="accented">Arabah</span> (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">In the hills</span>: the hill country of Judah (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the vale</span>: the <span class="accented">shephelah</span>, or lowland, the country lying between the mountain range of Judah and the Mediterranean Sea, and stretching northwards from the parallel of Gaza to that of Carmel. <span class="cmt_word">In the south</span>: the <span class="accented">negeb</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> southland (literally, <span class="accented">dryness</span>), the district which formed the transition from the desert to the cultivated land, extending from the south of the Dead Sea westwards to Gaza, a vast steppe or prairie, for the most part pasture land. The seashore: the narrow strip of land on the coast of the Mediterranean from <span class="accented">Joppa to</span> Tyre (in the New Testament, "the coast of Tyre and Sidon," <a href="../../par/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Canaanites</span>: the whole country of which these were the separate parts. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Lebanon</span>: the <span class="accented">Whale Mountain</span>, so called, probably, from the snow which rests on its summit. <span class="cmt_word">The great river, the river Euphrates</span>. The Phrath, or Euphrates, which has its sources in the mountains of Armenia, and in its course divides Armenia from Cappadocia, formed the eastern limit of the territory promised by God to Abraham.

The mention of Lebanon and the Euphrates is not, as Keil <span class="accented">suggests</span>, "to be attributed to the rhetorical fullness of the style;" but is due to the fact that these were included in what God promised to Abraham and his seed (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>).

The Lord had placed this land in the power of the Israelites, had given it up to them to possess and use it, according as he had sworn to their fathers, the patriarchs, to give it to them and their seed (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc.; Genesis 22:16). At Horeb, therefore, they received the charter of their inheritance, and might have gone on at once to take possession of the land. The delay that had occurred had arisen solely from their own waywardness and perversity, not from anything on the part of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-18.</span> - Moses reminds them that he had done all that was required on his part to conduct the people to the enjoyment of what God had freely given to them. The people had so increased in number that Moses found himself unable to attend to all the matters that concerned them, or to adjudicate in all the differences that arose among them. God had brought to pass that which he had promised to Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; in this Moses rejoiced, nay, he would even that their numbers were, with the Divine blessing, increased a thousandfold beyond what they were. But he found the burden, the weight of care and trouble, especially in connection with their strifes and suits thereby brought on him, too much for him; and, therefore, whilst they were still at Horeb, he had, following the advice of Jethro, his father-in-law, counseled them to select competent men from among themselves, who should relieve him by attending to those duties which he found it too burdensome for him to have to attend to (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a>, etc.). This appointment of captains was quite distinct from that of the elders whom God directed Moses to select that they might assist him in bearing the burden of the people (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-10.htm">Numbers 11:10</a>, etc.). The occasion of the appointment was the same in both cases, viz. the complaint of Moses that the task was too onerous for him, but the time, the place, and the manner of the two transactions were different. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I spake unto you at that time.</span> The somewhat indefinite phrase, "at that time" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>), does not refer to the time <span class="accented">after</span> the people departed from Horeb, but to the time generally when they were in that region (see <a href="../../par/exodus/18-5.htm">Exodus 18:5, 13</a>). "The imperfect (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, I spake), with <span class="accented">yaw</span> tel. expresses the order of thought and not of time" (Keil). It is not mentioned in Exodus that Moses spake to the people, as here stated, but what Jethro said to him to this effect is recorded; and as Moses proceeded to put in execution what his lather-in-law advised, it is probable that in doing so he told the people what he proposed to do, with his reasons for so doing, and obtained their assent, as here mentioned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye <i>are</i> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Notwithstanding the cruel oppression to which they were subjected in Egypt, the Israelites had so increased in numbers that they went out of the house of their bondage a mighty host. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). God had promised to Abraham that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; and Moses here reminds the people that this promise had been fulfilled. This is hardly to be regarded as the utterance of hyperbole. When God gave the premise to Abraham it was to the stars as <span class="accented">seen by the patriarch</span>, not as actually existing in the immensity of space, that reference was made; and as the number of stars which can be taken in with the naked eye does not exceed 3000, and as Israel at this time numbered more than 600,000, counting only the adult males (<a href="../../par/numbers/2-32.htm">Numbers 2:32</a>), - it might be literally said of them that they had been multiplied as the stars of heaven. The comparison, however, imported nothing more than that their numbers were very great.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-12.htm">Deuteronomy 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Moses appeals to the good sense of the people themselves: <span class="cmt_word">How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</span> <span class="accented">Cumbrance</span>: this is a just rendering of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, which, though it occurs only in the Hiphil in Hebrew, in the sense of to cast down (<a href="../../par/job/17-11.htm">Job 17:11</a>), probably was in use also in the Kal, in the sense of to lay upon, to encumber, which is the meaning of the cognate Arabic  followed by . <span class="accented">Burden</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, to lift up, to carry, to bear), something lifted up and carried, a load or burden. <span class="accented">Strife</span>: (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>) here, not mere contention, but litigation, suit-at-law. Some understand all these three, of troubles and burdens laid upon Moses, by his being called upon to compose differences, and adjust competing claims among the people. But other burdens besides these came upon him as the leader of the nation; and it seems best, therefore, to understand the first two of troubles and burdens generally.

The "things" referred to are either the injunctions specified in <a href="../../par/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a>, etc., or simply the instructions mentioned in the preceding verses. God had called the Israelites out of Egypt that they should go up at once to Canaan, and he had by Moses done all that was needed for this. But they had been rebellious, and had opposed God's commands, the consequence of which was that they had been made to experience various trials, especially to wander nearly forty years in the wilderness, so that of those who came out of Egypt only two were privileged to see the Promised Land. The words of Moses in this section supplement and complete the narrative in <a href="../../par/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>; but the words are those, not of a compiler, but of one who had been himself a witness of all he narrates. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That great and terrible wilderness</span>: the desert forming the western side of the Stony Arabia. It bears now the name of <span class="accented">Et-Tih</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. The Wandering, a name "doubtless derived from the wanderings of the Israelites, the tradition of which has been handed down through a period of three thousand years It is a pastoral <span class="accented">country</span>; unfitted as a whole for cultivation, because of its scanty soil and scarcity of water" (Dr. Porter, in Kitto's 'Biblical Cyclopedia,' vol. 3. p. 1075). In the northern part especially the country is rugged and bare, with vast tracts of sand, over which the scorching simoom often sweeps (see on ver. 1). This wilderness they had seen, had known, and had experience of, and their experience had been such that the district through which they had been doomed to wander appeared to them dreadful. Passing by the way of the Amorites, as they had been commanded (ver. 7), they came to Kadesh-barnea (see <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>). Their discontent broke out oftener than once, before they reached this place (see <a href="../../par/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11, 12</a>.); but Moses, in this recapitulation, passes over these earlier instances of their rebelliousness, and hastens to remind them of the rebellion at Kadesh (<a href="../../par/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13, 14</a>.), because it was this which led to the nation being doomed to wander in the wilderness until the generation that came out of Egypt had died. It was through faith in God that Canaan was to be gained and occupied by Israel; but this faith they lacked, and so they came short of what God had summoned them t, attain (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-22.htm">Psalm 78:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-24.htm">Psalm 106:24</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-18.htm">Hebrews 3:18, 19</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>). Hence, when they had come to the very borders of the Promised Land, and the hills of Canaan were before their eyes, and Moses said to them, in the name of God, <span class="cmt_word">Go up,</span> <span class="cmt_word">possess</span> ("asyndeton emphaticum," Mi-chaelis), they hung back, and proposed that men should be sent out to survey the land and bring a report concerning it. This was approved of by Moses; but when the spies returned and gave their report, the people were discouraged, and refused to go up. They were thus <span class="cmt_word">rebellious against the commandment</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the mouth</span>, the express will) of Jehovah their God; and not only so, but with signal ingratitude and impiety they murmured against him, and attributed their deliverance out of Egypt to God's hatred of them, that he might <span class="accented">destroy</span> them (see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-33</a>, to which the narrative here corresponds).

In the Hebrew text there is a strong stop (<span class="accented">athnach</span>) after <span class="accented">this word</span>, as if a pause of astonishment followed this utterance - Notwithstanding this word, strange to say! ye were not believing, etc. The participle ("believing") is intended to indicate the <span class="accented">continuing</span> of this unbelief. So also in ver. 34, the participle form is used - "who was going in the way before you," to indicate that not once and again, but continually, the Lord went before them; and this made the sin of their unbelief all the more marked and aggravated.

This parenthetical reference to himself was probably thrown in by Moses for the purpose of preparing for what he was about to say respecting Joshua, in whom the people were to find a leader after he himself was gone. It may be noted also that Moses distinguishes between the anger of the Lord against him, and the wrath which broke forth upon the people - a distinction which is aptly preserved in the Authorized Version by the words "was wroth" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span>) and "was angry" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of you</span>, <span class="accented">on accent of</span> you.

Thus, when Laban and Bethuel said to Abraham's servant "We cannot speak unto thee bad or good" (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>), the meaning is, We can say nothing at all. Absalom spake to Amnon "neither good nor bad" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-22.htm">2 Samuel 13:22</a>); that is, he did not say anything to him.

Hormah (Ban-place), the earlier name of which was Zephath (<a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>), was a royal city of the Canaanites, taken by the Israelites towards the close of their wanderings, and placed by them under a ban (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>, etc.), which ban was fully executed only in the time of the Judges. It is here and elsewhere called Hormah by anticipation. The old name Zephath seems to have survived that given to it by the Israelites in the name Sebaita or Sepata, the Arabic form of Zephath, the name of a heap of ruins on the western slope of the rocky mountain-plateau Rakhmah, about two hours and a half south-west of Khalasa (Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine,' 1:431; Palmer, 'Desert of Et-Tih,' p. 289, etc.).
