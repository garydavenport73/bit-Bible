But, as he was not to be always with them, it was needful to provide a supreme court, to which such cases might be carried when they could no longer be decided by him; and such a court is here appointed to be held at the sanctuary. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A matter too hard for thee</span>; literally, too <span class="accented">marvelous</span>; something extraordinary, and which could not be decided by the ordinary rules of the judicature. <span class="cmt_word">Between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in cases where blood had been shed and death had ensued, either accidentally or from murderous intent (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9</a>, etc.); in cases of disputed rights and claims (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-10.htm">2 Chronicles 19:10</a>); and in cases where corporeal injury had been suffered, whether in strife or from assault (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a>, etc.); and, in general, wherever <span class="cmt_word">matters of controversy</span> - disputes as to what was lawful and right, might arise in their towns and villages. In all such cases recourse was to be had to the court at the sanctuary - "to the priests the Levites," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the priests who were of the tribe of Levi, and to the judge presiding there - the lay judge associated with the high priest as president (see Oehler, in Herzog's 'Encyclop.,' vol. 5. p. 58). It is not intended by this that an appeal was to lie from the lower court to the higher, or that the parties in a suit might carry it at once to the supreme judge; the meaning rather is that, when the ordinary judges found a case too difficult for them to deal with, they were themselves to transmit it to the supreme court for decision.

In case, then, of their coming to desire to have a king over them like the nations around them, Moses gives instructions here as to the choice of a king, and as to the duties and obligations resting upon those who might be elevated to that office. The form in which these are conveyed clearly indicates that, at the time this was uttered, the existence of a king in Israel was contemplated as only a distant possibility. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou art come unto the land</span>, etc. This phraseology, which is common to the laws which respect the affairs of the Hebrews after they should be settled in Canaan, implies that this law was given whilst they were yet outside the Promised Land. It is plain also, from the tenor of the whole statement in this verse, that the legislator in this case is providing for what he supposes may happen, is likely to happen, but which he by no means desires should happen. Moses foresaw that the people would wish to be as the nations around them - governed by a king - and he legislates accordingly, without approving of that wish. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt in any wise set <i>him</i> king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: <i>one</i> from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which <i>is</i> not thy brother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The prohibition to choose a foreigner indicates that the people had the right of election. In what way this was to be exercised, and how it was subject to the Divine choice, is not declared. Judging from what actually happened in subsequent history, it would appear that only on special occasions, such as the election of the first king or a change of dynasty, did God take the initiative, and through a prophet direct the choice of the people; ultimately the monarchy became hereditary, and it was understood that the prince who succeeded to the throne did so with the Divine approval, unless the opposite was expressly intimated by a message from God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a></div><div class="verse">But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - Certain rules are prescribed for the king. It is forbidden to him to multiply horses, to multiply wives, and to amass large treasures of silver and gold, and he must have a copy of the Law written out for him from that kept by the priests, that he might have it by him, and read it all the days of his life. The multiplying of horses is prohibited, because this would bring Israel into intercourse and friendly relations with Egypt, and might tend to their going back to that country from which they had been so marvelously delivered; a prohibition which could only have been given at an early stage in the history of the people, for at a later period, after they had been well established in Canaan, such a prohibition for such a reason would have been simply ridiculous. The prohibition to multiply wives and to amass large treasures has respect to the usage common from the earliest period with Oriental monarchs to have vast harems and huge accumulations of the precious metals, as much for ostentation as for either luxury or use; and as there was no small danger of the King of Israel being seduced to follow this usage, and so to have his heart turned away from the Lord, it was fitting that such a prohibition should be prospectively enacted for his guidance. Both these prohibitions were neglected by Solomon, and probably by others of the Jewish kings; but this only indicates that the law was so ancient that it had come in their time to be regarded as obsolete. The rule that the king was to write him a copy of the Law for his own constant use does not necessarily imply that he was to write this with his own hand; he might cause it to be written by some qualified scribe for him.

The Jews understand by "double" that <span class="accented">two</span> copies of the Law were to be made by the king (Maimon., ' De Regibus,' e. 3. &sect; 1); but this is unnecessary: every copy of a law is a double of it.
