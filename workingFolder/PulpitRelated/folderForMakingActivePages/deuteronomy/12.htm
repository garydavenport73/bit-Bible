Moses, as the servant of God, had taught Israel statutes and rights, as God had commanded him (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a>); and now he recapitulates the principal of these for their guidance in the way of obedience. These they were to observe all the days of their life upon the land that was to be given them; the land was the Lord's, and there, as long as they possessed it, the Law of the <span class="accented">Lord was to be</span> paramount.

The heathen had their places of worship on lofty elevations, probably because they imagined they were thus nearer to the object of their worship; and they sought also the shade of woods or thick-foliaged trees (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>), under which to perform their rites, as tending to inspire awe, and as in keeping with the mysterious character of their rites. These places of heathen worship in Canaan the Israelites were utterly to destroy, along with the images of their deities and other objects of idolatrous worship. <span class="cmt_word">Burn their groves</span>; <span class="accented">their asherahs</span>, idol-pillars of wood (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>).

As the revealed God - the God whose being and perfections had been made known, not by a vague revelation of him in nature merely, but expressly by his putting or recording his Name historically and locally among men (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>) - so should there be a definite place chosen and appointed by him where he would come to receive the worship of his people, where he would record his Name, and where he would be known for a Refuge and a Helper to all who put their trust in him (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/76-1.htm">Psalm 76:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>). The Name of God is God himself as revealed; and he puts his Name on any place where he specially manifests himself as present  (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>), and which is consequently to be regarded as his habitation or dwelling-place. Hence the temple at Jerusalem was in later times known as the place of the Name of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), the dwelling-place of his glory (<a href="../../par/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a>). But he is the God of the whole earth, and therefore, wherever he is pleased to reveal himself, in whatever place he makes his Name to be known, there he is to be worshipped. There is no reference in this passage to the temple at Jerusalem specially, as some have supposed; what is here enjoined is only a practical application of the Divine promise, that in <span class="accented">all</span> places where God would record his Name, there he would come to bless his people (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The reference here, therefore, is quite general, and applies to any place where, by the Divine appointment, the tabernacle might be set up and the worship of Jehovah instituted. <span class="cmt_word">Unto his habitation shall ye seek.</span> To seek to any place means, primarily, to resort to it, to frequent it (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-5.htm">2 Chronicles 1:5</a>), but with the implied purpose of inquiring there for something, as for responses or oracles, when the place resorted to was that in which God had put his Name.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there ye shall eat before the Lord.</span> The injunction here and in ver. 17, respecting the eating by the offerer of the firstlings of his flocks and herds, appears to be inconsistent with the injunction in <a href="../../par/numbers/18-18.htm">Numbers 18:18</a>. There it seems as if the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the flesh was to be given to the priest. "And the flesh of them shall be thine [the priest's], as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine." This may be taken to mean that just as the wave breast and the right shoulder are the perquisites of the priests in the case of other offerings, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the peace offering, so in the case of the firstling offering the whole flesh shall be the priest's; and thus taken, the passage presents an unquestionable discrepancy to that in Deuteronomy. But probably the passage is not to be so taken. The particle translated "as" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>.) not infrequently occurs in the sense of "according to, after the manner of," implying conformity to some rule or model (<a href="../../par/genesis/44-2.htm">Genesis 44:2</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-4.htm">Numbers 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/9-3.htm">Numbers 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-18.htm">Numbers 29:18</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Zechariah 2:10 [Zechariah 2:6], etc.). The passage, therefore, may be rendered thus: <span class="accented">And the flesh of them shalt thou take after the manner</span> (<span class="accented">or according to the rule</span>), of the wave breast, etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the whole of it, but only these parts. So the LXX. seem to have taken the passage: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Of some of the offerings the whole was received by the priest, as in the case of the sin offering and trespass offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, etc.; Leviticus 7:1, etc.); while of others only certain portions, viz. the wave breast and the heave shoulder, were given to him, as in the case of the peace offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-28.htm">Leviticus 7:28</a>, etc.). The purport of the law in <a href="../../par/numbers/18-18.htm">Numbers 18:18</a> is that, in respect of the firstling offering, the allotment to the priest shall be after the same manner as in the peace offering. There is thus no discrepancy between the two passages. The animal belonged originally to the offerer; when he brought it before the Lord part of it was consumed on the altar, part of it was assigned to the priest, and the rest, as a matter of course, remained with himself. The law in Numbers, addressed to the priest, intimates what he might claim as his portion; the law in Deuteronomy, where the people are addressed, directs them how to use the portion that remained with them. It may be added that, even supposing that all the flesh was given to the priest, yet, as it had to be consumed on the day in which the sacrifice was offered, and as every clean person in the house might partake of it, it is almost certain that the offerer would, as a matter of course, share in the meal, as was usual in the case of sacrificial meals. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto</span>; enjoy whatever your hand may gain, whatever you may earn, all the good which the Lord may give you (cf. ver. 18; 15:10; 23. 20; 28:8, 20). The phrase is peculiar to Deuteronomy; but comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>.

But after they were settled in Canaan it should no longer be so; a certain order and fixed locality should be determined for their worship and service; when they had passed over Jordan the Lord would give them rest from all their enemies, and then all irregularity and arbitrariness in the matter of worship must cease, and all their gifts arid offerings must be brought to the place which Jehovah their God should choose. <span class="cmt_word">Ye dwell in safety</span>; rather, <span class="accented">dwell securely</span>, not only safe from assault, but without fear or anxiety (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>).

Hence, perhaps, they are described as "within the gates" of the rest of the people. Or, as the Levites seem to have itinerated in the discharge of various offices among the people, the phrase may designate them as on this account occasionally resident among others in their community; just as "the stranger that is within thy gates" means the person of some other nation who for the time being was resident in any of the towns of Israel.

By this word the Hebrews designated the animal life-principle in men and in beasts; and as without this the body was a mere inert mass, the word came to be used for "life" generally. Of this life the blood was believed to be the seat, and was regarded as the symbol, so that to shed blood was tantamount to the taking away of life. As the blood, moreover, was the life, in it was supposed to lie the propitiatory power - the power, when shed, of atoning for sin, as the giving of life for life. The prohibition of eating it doubtless had respect to this. It was not merely to prevent ferocity in men towards the lower animals (as Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests) that the eating of blood was interdicted, but specially because there was in this a sort of profanation, a putting to a common use of what appertained to a sacred rite.
