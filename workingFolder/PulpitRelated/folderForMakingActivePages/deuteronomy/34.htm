This wide prospect could not be surveyed by any ordinary power of vision; so that Moses must for the occasion have had his power of vision miraculously increased. There is no ground for supposing that he saw the scene in an ecstatic vision, and not with his bodily eyes.

The rabbins interpret this, "by a kiss of the Lord" ('Baba Bathra,' 17 a); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as Maimonides explains it ('More Nevoch.,' 3:51), Moses "died in a moment of holiest joy in the knowledge and love of God." The phrase, however, simply means "by or according to the command of" (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/45-21.htm">Genesis 45:21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-12.htm">Leviticus 24:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-16.htm">Numbers 3:16</a>, etc.).

The rabbins say that Moses was buried by retiring into a cavern, where he died and where his body remained. It is probable that, like Enoch  and Elijah, he was transferred to the invisible world without seeing corruption. Hence his appearance along with Elijah in bodily form on the Mount of the Transfiguration; and hence also, perhaps, the tradition of the contest for the body of Moses between Michael and Satan (<a href="../../par/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>). If the body of <span class="accented">Moses</span> was actually buried, the concealment of his grave so that no man knew of it may be justly regarded as "the first instance on record of the providential obliteration, so remarkably exemplified afterwards in the gospel history, of the ' holy places' of Palestine; the providential safeguard against their elevation to a sanctity which might endanger the real holiness of the history and religion which they served to commemorate" (Stanley). The reverence which the Jews paid to graves shows that there was no small danger of their coming under a superstitious regard to that of Moses had it been known.

It is used here of the natural juices of the body.

The knowledge here referred to was not merely that cognizance which God as the Omniscient has of all men, but that special knowledge by which men, being known of God, are made to know him (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). The statement in this verse could only have been inserted some time after the death of Moses, and after the people had had manifestations of God's presence with them, both by communications from him through the prophets and by the successes which he had given them over their enemies. But it is not necessary to suppose that a long period during which a lengthened succession of prophets had arisen had elapsed. "<span class="accented">Moses</span> was the founder and mediator of the old covenant. As long as this covenant was to last, no prophet could arise in Israel like unto Moses. There is but One who is worthy of greater honor than Moses, namely, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, who is placed as a Son over all the house of God, in which Moses was found faithful as a servant (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2-6</a> with <a href="../../par/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), Jesus Christ, the Founder and Mediator of the new and everlasting covenant" (Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
