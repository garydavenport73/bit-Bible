<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of <i>our</i> faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Looking unto the Author and Finisher of our faith</span> (rather, <span class="accented">the Leader</span>, or <span class="accented">Captain</span>, as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>, and <span class="accented">Perfecter of the faith</span>, or <span class="accented">of faith - faith's</span> Captain and Completer), <span class="cmt_word">Jesus; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span> The idea is not, as implied in the A.V. and understood by Chrysostom and other ancients, that Jesus first inspires and then brings to its complete result the individual Christian's faith ("quod caepit in nobis consummabit"), but (as implied in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, and suiting the context better) that he is the Leader of the whole army of faith, whose standard we are to follow, and whoso own completed victory is the enabling cause as well as the earnest of our own. It is no valid objection to this view that he could not have been a Leader in this sense to the faithful ones before his coming, referred to in the last chapter; for, as has been before observed (see on "the reproach of Christ," <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>), he is regarded as the Head and Leader, in all ages, of the faithful; and in virtue of his future warfare for mankind the saints of old endured and triumphed: - and certainly Christians, to whom the exhortation is addressed, may look to him in an obvious sense as their Captain to be followed. Nor, again, is there difficulty - apart from that of the whole mystery of the Incarnation - in his being presented to us as himself an example of triumphant faith. For he is elsewhere spoken of as having so "emptied himself" of his Divine glory as to have become like unto us in all things, sin except; and thus to have been sustained during his human life by faith in the unseen, as we are. His addresses to the Father (see especially <a href="../../par/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.) are strikingly significant in this regard. The expression, "for the joy," etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), does not mean, as some take it, "instead <span class="accented">of</span> the joy which he might have had on earth" (such e.g. as was offered to him by the tempter), but, as is evident from the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "as set against, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the sake of, future joy" (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 16). Such looking forward to joy with the Father and the redeemed after triumph is expressed in the great intercessory prayer-above referred to (<a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 13, 22, 23, 24, 26</a>). It may be here observed that anticipation of reward hereafter is among legitimate human motives to a good life. It may be said, indeed, that the highest virtue consists in doing what is right simply because it is right - in fulfilling God's will, whatever may come of it to ourselves; but the hope of a final happy issue comes properly, and indeed inevitably, in as an inspiring and sustaining motive. Aspiration after Happiness is a God-given instinct of humanity, necessary for keeping up the life of virtue. There may be some so in love with virtue as to be capable of persevering in lifelong self-denial, though without any faith in a life to come. But human nature in general certainly requires this further incentive, and Christian faith supplies it. Nor are those who thus work with a view to future joy to be accused of selfish motives, as though they balanced only a greater against a smaller gain. To the true Christian the grand inspiring principle is still the love of God and of his neighbor, and of goodness for its own sake, though the hope of an eternal reward supports and cheers him mightily. Nor, again, is the joy looked forward to a selfish joy. It is the joy of sharing in the triumph of eternal righteousness in company with all the redeemed, whose salvation, no less than his own, he desires and strives for. And, further, with regard to his own individual joy, what is it but the joy of attaining the end of his being, the perfection God meant him for, and to which it is his duty to aspire? Hence Christ would not have been a perfect Example to man had he not been represented as looking forward to "the joy that was set before him."

Moreover, it is required for the sense of the passage in regard to the proper meaning of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("endure"), which is to "submit to," or "endure patiently," not simply "to undergo." For to say, "if ye endure chastisement patiently, God dealeth with you as sons," has no meaning; our being treated as sons depends, not on the way we take our chastisement, but on our being chastised at all. The use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> to express purpose is common in this Epistle (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 3:5, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: 4:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 6:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>): and the essential sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is discipline or education. The drift is the same, whether we take <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> as an indicative or an imperative. Thus the next clause of the verse follows suitably: <span class="cmt_word">God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there</span> (or, <span class="accented">who is a son</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whom his father chasteneth not?

Some (among moderns Delitzsch) find here a support to the theory of creationism as against traducianism; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the soul of each individual, as distinct from the body, is a new creation, not transmitted from the parents.

Our earthly parents transmit to us our carnal existence; our spiritual part, in whatever mysterious way derived or inspired, is duo to our Divine parentage; and it is in respect of this that we are God's children and accountable to him. But, as has been intimated above, it is not human spirits only that are here in the writer's view. God is the Father of all "the spirits," whether in the flesh or not; all are of Divine parentage, for God himself is Spirit  - <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).

The discipline of our earthly fathers was "for a few days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> during our childhood only, since which we have been left to ourselves; and even then not necessarily for our greatest advantage; it was only as seemed good to them (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); it might be injudicious, or even capricious. But our heavenly Father's discipline we may trust to be always good for us, and with a definite final purpose. Though there is here no distinctly expressed antithesis to the "few days" of ordinary parental chastisement, yet one is implied in the last clause; for if God's purpose in chastening us is to make us partakers of his own holiness, we may conclude that the discipline will be continued till the end be attained; and thus also a further reason is implied why Christians should not "faint" under even lifelong trials.

It is observable that the words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., are arranged so as to form an hexameter line. This may have been unintentional, but it is at any rate effective. Delitzsch remarks on it. "The duty to which the writer urges, his, readers is courageous self-recovery m Gods strength. The tone and language are elevated accordingly, and ver. 12 is like a trumpet-blast. It need not surprise us, then, if our author here turns poet, and proceeds in heroic measures." With regard to the purport of this verse, we observe that, while the figure of running is still continued, a new idea is introduced - that of pursuing a straight course with a view to others who are to follow on the same track. "That which is lame (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" denotes the weak and wavering brethren - the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, such as are referred to in <a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. The expression well suits (specially those among the Hebrew Christians who halted between two opinions  - between the Church and the synagogue (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>;). The strong in faith ought to desire and aim at the <span class="accented">healing</span> of such lame ones, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their being strengthened in the faith, rather than expose them to the risk of apostasy by any wavering of their own.

The exhortation to "peace with all" reminds of the tone of St. Paul's admonitions both in Romans and in 1 Corinthians, where he so strongly warns against dissensions and party spirit, and enjoins tolerance and mutual allowance with regard to the weaker brethren. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ("sanctification") need not be limited (as by Chrysostom) to the idea of <span class="accented">chastity</span>; the general thought implied may be (as expressed by Limborch, quoted by Alford), "<span class="accented">No</span>, dum pact studeat, nimis slits obsequendi studio quidquam contra sanctimonism Christianam delinquat;" but the special allusion to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 16 (as also in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>) is evidence that <span class="accented">chastity</span> was especially in the writer's mind, with definite reference to which the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>. The frequent and earnest warnings against fornication in St. Paul's Epistles are enough to show how slow even some in the Church were to recognize the strict code of Christian morality, unknown to the heathen world, and by the Jews very imperfectly recognized, in this regard; and the case of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>. illustrates how easily such vice might creep into and infect a Christian community without general reprobation. Hence probably the special warning here.

The reference in the speech of Moses is to the future possibility of any "man, or we man, or family, or tribe" turning from the LORD to go and serve the gods of the nations, and so involving, not only themselves, but even the whole people in a curse. The figure is that of a plant being allowed to grow of such a nature at its root as to bear bitter and pernicious fruit. There is no special allusion in the word "bitterness" to disturbance of "peace" by dissensions; for this is not the idea in the original passage, nor is it carried out in the following verses of the Epistle. (Cf. <a href="../../par/acts/8-23.htm">Acts 8:23</a>, "Thou art in the gall of bitterness (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)") 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a></div><div class="verse">Lest there <i>be</i> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

Esau is appropriately adduced as a notable instance in the Old Testament of a person thus profane, and especially, in the way of warning, of one who lost irrecoverably the privileges which in his profaneness he had scorned. It is immaterial whether Esau himself is intended to be designated as a fornicator (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) as well as profane (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The essential moral of his history is this: being the firstborn of Israel, and so the primary inheritor of the promises made to Abraham, he set no store by the privilege, and so lost it irretrievably. In early life he so lightly esteemed his birthright as the eldest born (carrying with it, as is supposed, in the patriarchal age, the priesthood of the family, and in his case, as might be presumed, the custody and transmission of the promises) that he parted with it for the gratification of a passing appetite. His words on that occasion expressed the limit of his aims and interests: "Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?" Later in life he nevertheless presented himself to claim the blessing of the firstborn from his dying father, but found that he had been forestalled. It does not appear that he had meanwhile changed his mode of life or made amends for his former carelessness; still, he felt now that he had lost something worth having, and was grieved exceedingly. But not even his "great and exceeding bitter cry" availed then to recover what was forfeited. And so neither he nor his seed had part or lot in the Abrahamic promises: the time of opportunity was gone forever. There is some doubt with regard to the latter part of ver. 17, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as to whether "it" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) in "he sought it" refers to "repentance" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) or to "the blessing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to what "place of repentance" means. If "it" refers to "repentance," it is difficult to see how Esau's own repentance can be meant; for not only does seeking repentance with tears seem in itself to imply the capability of it, but also the "great and exceeding bitter cry" to which allusion is made was, not because he could not himself repent, but because he could not get the blessing. Hence, if "it" refers to "repentance," it must be repentance, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> change of mind, in Isaac that is meant, or rather in God, against whose will Isaac could not go; cf. "God is not a man...  that he should repent" (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). Of such change of mind and purpose it may be meant that Esau found no place. This seems to be the view of many modern interpreters, though not of Bengel, De Wette, Bleek, Hofmann, Delitzsch, Alford, or of Luther, Calvin, Grotius, or any of the Greek Fathers. Against it is the consideration that such is not the more obvious meaning of "he found no place of repentance," taken by itself, especially as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is always elsewhere in the New Testament (though not always in the LXX.) used for a person's change of mind with respect to his own misdoings (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 6:6). Difficulty on this ground is removed if, taking the clause, "for he found no place of repentance," as parenthetical, we refer <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, preceding. This is by no means a forced construction of the sentence, and it is supported (as above intimated) by the fact that in Genesis it is the blessing itself that Esau is expressly said to have craved in his "great and exceeding bitter cry:" "Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, <span class="accented">even</span> me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept." Thus we may render either, "When he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of change of mind in the bestower of the blessing], though he sought it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> such change of mind] with tears;" or, "When he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected (for he found no place of repentance), though he sought it [i.e. the blessing] with tears." If, the latter rendering being adopted, Esau's own repentance be intended, the idea maybe, either that there was no place left in which even a real repentance could avail, or that of a real repentance he had become incapable; for his tears might be those only of vexation and remorse, not expressing any more appreciation than before of the birthright in its religious aspect. Ebrard's remark, that his conduct as related in <a href="../../par/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33</a>, shows "a changed heart," and hence a true repentance, is not to the point. For all that there appears is that he had got over his angry feeling towards his brother; it is by no means implied - rather the contrary - that he would have preferred his destiny to his own, or that his views of life had risen above thoughts of worldly prosperity. We observe, further, that nothing is implied one way or the other as to Esau's own salvation; it is only the privilege of being the patriarch of the chosen seed that he is said to have thus irrecoverably forfeited. But his example is adduced as a warning to Christians with regard to their still more precious inheritance, which does involve their own eternal prospects. The warning to them is similar to those of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc., and <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc., to the effect that sacred privileges, if persistently slighted, may be lost beyond recovery. And if the passage before us seems to imply, according to one view of it, what the former ones were found not to do, the possible inefficacy of a true repentance, however late, - we may say that, even if this is implied of Esau with respect to his lost blessing, it is not therefore necessarily implied of Christians with respect to their personal salvation; or that, if it is implied of them, it is not till their probation in this life is over that a "place of repentance" in this sense can for them be found no more (cf. the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, etc.); also <a href="../../par/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>, etc.). One of Dr. Newman's Parochial Sermons ("Life the Season of Repentance," vol. 6. 'Sermon' 2) strikingly sets forth this view. See also 'Christian Year' (Second Sunday in Lent), with the appended note: "Esau's probation, as far as his birthright was concerned, was quite over when he uttered the cry in the text. His despondency, therefore, is not parallel to anything on this side the grave."

If so, the main purpose of the word is to contrast the local and palpable mountain of the Law with the ideal Mount Zion which is afterwards spoken cf. Or, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> may here carry with it its common sense of groping after, as in the dark (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), with reference to the cloudy darkness about Sinai, and in contrast with the clear unclouded vision of Zion.

This whole account, thus powerfully condensed from Exodus and Deuteronomy, presents a vivid picture of the terrors of the Mosaic revelation.

But now mark the serene and glorious contrast.

The foundation of the conception is in the Old Testament. When David at length won the citadel of Zion, and placed the ark upon it, it was a sort of primary and typical fulfillment of the promise of rest, seen afar off by the patriarchs and from the wilderness. <a href="../../par/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>, which was sung on that occasion, expresses the idea of the King of glory being at length enthroned there, and his people of clean hands and pure hearts being admitted to stand in the holy place before him (cf. "This is my rest forever: here will I dwell," <a href="../../par/psalms/132-14.htm">Psalm 132:14</a>). In the Psalms generally the holy hill of Zion continues to be viewed as the LORD'S immovable abode, where he is surrounded by thousands of angels, and whence he succors his people (cf. <span class="accented">Psalm</span> 48; 68; 125; 132; etc.). Then by the prophets it is further idealized as the scene and center of Messianic blessings (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>; 25:13; 33; 35; 46:13; <a href="../../par/micah/4.htm">Micah 4</a>; to which many other passages might be added). Compare also the visions, in the latter chapters of Ezekiel, of the ideal city and temple of the future age. Lastly, in the Apocalypse the seer has visions of "Mount Zion" (14.), and "the holy city, new Jerusalem" (21.), with the presence there of God and the Lamb, and with myriads of angels, and innumerable multitudes of saints redeemed. If, in the passage before us, a distinction is to be made between "Mount Zion" and "the heavenly Jerusalem," it may be that the former represents the Church below, the latter the heavenly regions, though both are blent together in one grand picture of the communion of saints. For so in <a href="../../par/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. the hundred and forty-four thousand on Mount Zion seem distinct from the singers and harpers round the throne, whose song is heard from heaven and learnt by those below; while the picture of the holy city in <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. is one entirely heavenly, representing there the final consummation rather than any present state of things. <span class="cmt_word">And to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn</span> (rather, <span class="accented">and to myriads</span>, <span class="accented">the general assembly of angels</span>, <span class="accented">and the Church of the Firstborn</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel</span> (literally, <span class="accented">than Abel</span>). Of the several ways of translating the beginning of the above passage, the best seems to be to take <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by itself as including both the angels and the Church of the Firstborn, and to connect <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> with "angels" only. "Myriads" is a well-known expression for the LORD'S attendant hosts (cf. <a href="../../par/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-2.htm">Deuteronomy 30:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>); further, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, which throughout the passage connects the different objects approached, comes between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the application of both <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would seem an unmeaning redundancy. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which in classical Greek denotes properly the assembly of a whole nation for a festival, is peculiarly appropriate to the angels, whether regarded (as in the Old Testament) as ministering round the throne or as congregated to rejoice over man's redemption.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may be suggested here by the firstborn of Israel, who were specially hallowed to the Lord (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>), and numbered as such by Moses (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>), or perhaps still more by the birthright (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) spoken of above as forfeited by Esau. God's elect may be called his firstborn as being hallowed to him and heirs of his promises (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>," Israel is my son, <span class="accented">even</span> my firstborn;" and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>, "Ephraim is my firstborn"). They thus correspond to the hundred and forty-four thousand of <a href="../../par/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>, standing on Mount Zion, being "redeemed from the earth," and having "the Father's Name written on their foreheads;" seen distinct from, and yet in communion with, the saints in bliss, whose voices are heard above. Between them and the spirits of the perfected is interposed, "God the Judge of all;" and this appropriately, since before him the saints on earth must appear ere they join the ranks of the perfected: the former look up to him from below; the latter have already passed before him to the rest assigned them. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("perfected") expresses, as elsewhere in the Epistle, full accomplishment of an and or purpose with regard to things or persons (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-9.htm">Hebrews 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-40.htm">Hebrews 11:40</a>); the word is used here of those whose warfare is accomplished, and who have attained the rest of God. Their "spirits" only are spoken of, because the "perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul" is still to come. In the mean while, with respect to the issue of their earthly course, they have been already perfected (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, "They rest from their labors"). Corresponding to the Lamb in Revelation, there is seen next Jesus the Mediator, through whom is the approach of the whole company to the Judge of all, and the accomplishment to the perfected. The "<span class="accented">new</span> covenant" is, of course, meant to be contrasted with the old one before Mount Sinai, under which there was no such approach or accomplishment. Then "the blood of sprinkling" has reference to that wherewith the old covenant was ratified (<a href="../../par/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>; <span class="accented">cf. supra</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18</a>). The blood shed by Christ on earth for atonement is conceived as carried by him with himself into the holy place on high (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>), to be forever "<span class="accented">the</span> blood of sprinkling for effectual cleansing. And this blood "speaketh better things than Abel." His blood cried from the ground for vengeance, with the accusing voice of primeval sin; Christ's speaks only of reconciliation and peace. Some commentators (Bengel in the first place, whom Delitzsch follows)see in this contrast between Sinai and Zion a distinct parallelism between vers. 18, 19 and vers. 22-24; seven objects of approach in one case being supposed to be set against seven in the other, More obvious is the correspondence of the successive clauses of vers. 22-24 to the general ideas connected with the giving of the Law. The two pictures may be contrasted thus - <span class="accented">The Old Covenant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sinai, a palpable earthly mountain, surrounded by gloom and storm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The angels through whom the Law was given (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>), unseen by men, but operating in the winds and in the fire (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Israel congregated under the mountain, afraid, and forbidden to touch it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LORD, unapproachable, shrouded in darkness or revealed in fire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Moses, himself afraid, and winning through his mediation no access for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The blood sprinkled on the people to ratify the old covenant, but which could not cleanse the conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, inspiring fear. <span class="accented">The New Covenant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Zion, radiant with light and crowned with the city of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Festal choirs of assembled angels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The accepted Church of the Firstborn, with free approach to the holiest of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Judge of all, without his terrors, accessible, and awarding rest to the perfected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Divine availing Mediator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ever-cleansing blood of complete atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The voice of that cleansing blood, speaking of peace and pardon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such is the vision by the contemplation of which the inspired writer would arouse his readers, amid their trials and waverings, to realize the things that are eternal. He would have them pierce with the eye of faith beyond this visible scene into the world invisible, which is no less real. If they were perplexed and disheartened by what they found around them - by the opposition of the world and the fewness of the faithful - he bids them associate themselves in thought with those countless multitudes who were on their side. The picture is, indeed, in some respects, ideal; for the actual Church on earth does not come up to the idea of the "Church of the Firstborn;" but it is presented according to God's purpose for his people, and it rests with us to make it a present reality to ourselves.

But the subject is changed: it is God, not the "blood of sprinkling," that is now regarded as speaking to us from heaven.

Again, ver. 21, "I will shake the heavens and the earth" (cf. lea. 2:19, 21). The prophecy was uttered with reference to the second temple, the glory of which was to be greater than the glory of the first, in that it should be the scene of the LORD'S final revelation of himself to his people. Its first fulfillment is rightly seen in Christ's first coming (cf. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>, "And in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts;" and <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple"). But the language used points evidently, even in itself, to a further fulfillment; nor do readers need to be reminded here of the pregnant and far-reaching sense of all Messianic prophecy. "Illustre est testimonium Psalm Newtoni ad Dan. p. 91: <span class="accented">vixque in omni V.T. aliquod de Christo extat vaticinium</span>, <span class="accented">quod non</span>, <span class="accented">aliquatenus saltem</span>, <span class="accented">secundum ejus ad-ventum respiciat"</span> (Bengel). The ultimate reference is what is seen dimly afar off in so many of the prophetic visions - the final dissolution of the whole present order of things, to be succeeded by the kingdom of eternal righteousness (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>, etc.). By the heaven that is to be shaken in that great day is meant, of course, not the eternal abode of God, but that which is created and visible (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 27). This final shaking is set against the local and typical shaking of Mount Sinai in two points of contrast - its extending to the whole creation, and its being once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>); and from the latter expression the removing of the things thus finally shaken is in the next verse inferred. This inference, though not following necessarily from the expression itself, is involved in the general drift of Haggai's prophecy, taken in connection with other cognate ones, in which an entirely new and heavenly order is pictured as rising over the ruins of the old (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>, referred to in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7, 10, 13</a>, "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
