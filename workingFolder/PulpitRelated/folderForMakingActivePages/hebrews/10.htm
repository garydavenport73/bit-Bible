It is entitled "a psalm of David," nor is there anything in the psalm itself incompatible with his authorship. The question of authorship is, however, unimportant; all that is required for the purpose of the quotation being that it should have been the utterance of an inspired psalmist. The primary import of the passage quoted is that the psalmist, after deliverance from great affliction, for which he gives thanks, expresses his desire to act on the lesson learnt in his trouble by giving himself entirely to God's service. And the service in which God delights he declares to be, not sacrifices of slain beasts, but the doing of his will, the ears being opened to his Word, and his Law being within the heart. Now, bearing in mind what was said under Hebrews 1:5, of the principle on which words used in the Old Testament with a primary human reference are applied in the New Testament directly to Christ, we shall have no difficulty in understanding such application here. The psalmist, it may be allowed, spoke in his own person, and as expressing his own feelings and desires; but, writing under inspiration, he aspired to an ideal beyond his own attainment, the true ideal for humanity, to be realized only in Christ. The ideal is such perfect self-oblation of the human will to God's as to supersede and render needless the existing sacrifices, which are acknowledged to be, in their own nature, valueless. That the psalmist did not really contemplate the fulfillment of this ideal in himself is evident from the penitential confessions of the latter verses of the psalm. It is but the yearning of inspired humanity for what was really needed for reconciliation with God, such yearning being in itself a prophecy. Hence what was thus spoken in the Spirit is adduced as expressing the mind and work of him who fulfilled all those prophetic yearnings, and effected, as Man and for man, what the holy men of old longed to do but could not. The expression, "when he cometh into the world," reminds us of <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, here used, is connected in thought with the <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> ("I am come") in the quotation. Idle are the inquiries of some commentators as to the precise time, either before or after the Incarnation, at which our Lord is to be conceived as so speaking. Enough to say that his purpose in coming into the world is in these significant words expressed. It is noteworthy, in regard to the attribution of this utterance to him, how frequently he is recorded to have spoken of having <span class="accented">come</span> into the world for the accomplishment of a purpose "genie, vel potius, <span class="accented">vent</span>, symbolum quasi Domini <span class="accented">Jesu</span> fuit" (Bengel). (See <a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-38.htm">Mark 1:38</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>; and especially for close agreement with the language of the passage before us, <a href="../../par/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, "I came down from heaven, not to do mine own <span class="accented">will</span>, but the <span class="accented">will</span> of him that tent me;" and <a href="../../par/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>, "I <span class="accented">am come</span> a light <span class="accented">into the world."</span>) The psalm is quoted from the LXX., with slight variation, not worth considering, as it does not affect the sense of the passage. But the variation of the LXX. from the Hebrew text requires notice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Instead of "a body didst thou prepare for me (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)" of the LXX. and the quotation from it, the Hebrew has "mine ears hast thou opened;" literally, "ears hast thou dug for me," meaning probably, "formed the cavity of my ears through which thy Word may penetrate," equivalent to "given me ears to hear," with reference, of course, to spiritual auscultation. If to the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> be assigned here the sense of <span class="accented">piercing</span>, rather than <span class="accented">hollowing out</span>, implying an entrance affected through the ears already formed, the general sense remains the same. In either case the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> may be accounted for, as being a free rendering, intended to give the meaning of the figure. But the substitution of "body" for "ears" is not so easily accounted for. One conjecture is that some transcriber of the Alexandrian translation of the Hebrew had inadvertently joined the last letter of the preceding word, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, to the following word, <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x399;</span> of <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3a9;&#x3a4;&#x399;&#x391;</span> was then changed into the <span class="greek">&#x39c;</span> of <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a9;&#x39c;&#x391;</span>, so as to make sense of the word thus formed. But this is only conjecture. That some copies of the LXX. had <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> appears from the fact that the Vulgate, translated from the LXX., reads <span class="accented">aures perfecisti mihi</span>, and that some manuscripts of the LXX. still have <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1fb3;</span>. Thus there can be little doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> was a wrong rendering of the Hebrew, however originating, which the writer of the Epistle found in the copies of the LXX. which he used. For that he himself altered the word to suit his purpose, and that the alteration got into copies of the LXX. from the Epistle, is highly improbable, considering the general accuracy of his quotations, and his purpose of proving his positions from the sacred documents to which his readers could refer. As to the unimportance of any such variations from the original Hebrew in the quotations of the Epistle from the LXX., as long as the argument is not affected, see what is said under Hebrews 1:7 with respect to the quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>. In this case the variation certainly does not affect the argument. For though the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is certainly taken up again in ver. 10 as applicable to Christ, yet the argument of the passage by no means rests on this word, but on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. This is indeed a passage (as was observed under Hebrews 9:14) notable for the very fact that the essence of the atonement is in it represented as consisting, not so much in its physical accompaniments as in its being a spiritual act of perfect self-oblation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The more probable meaning of the phrase translated in the LXX. and the quotation, "it is written <span class="accented">of</span> me <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)" is in the Hebrew," it is prescribed <span class="accented">unto</span> me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "laid on me as a duty;" this being also the sense in which the same words occur in <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, "Great is the wrath of the Lord... because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is <span class="accented">prescribed to us</span>;" where the LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The most obvious reference of the Hebrew psalm is to the Book of the Law generally, in which the duty of fulfilling the Divine will is enjoined, rather than to any <span class="accented">prophecy</span>, applied by the writer to himself individually. If so, it is not necessary to inquire what prophecy about himself David might have had in view; whether e.g. <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>; or <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span> But the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, does certainly rather suggest a <span class="accented">prophecy</span>, and such suggestion is peculiarly appropriate in the application to Christ. Well, then, if here again there is some variation from the original Hebrew text, it is still such as to leave the general argument intact.

For the writer's purpose in referring once more to Jeremiah's prediction of the" new covenant" is to show from it the completeness and finality of Christ's atonement; and this, he argues, follows from this characteristic of the "new covenant" being added to the previous description of it - "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." CH. 10:19-END. HORTATORY PORTION OF THE EPISTLE. The great doctrine of Christ's eternal priesthood having been led up to, established by argument, and at length fully expounded, it remains only to press the practical result of a belief in it in alternate tones of encouragement and of warning. We have seen that, even in the earlier chapters, hortatory passages were frequently interposed, showing the purpose all along in the writer's mind. In the central and deepest part of the argument (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-10:19</a>) there were none, close and uninterrupted attention to the course of thought being then demanded. But now, the argument being completed, the previous exhortations are taken up again, and enforced in consequently fuller and deeper tones. The connection of thought between these final admonitions and those previously interposed is evident when we compare the very expressions in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-23</a> with those in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>, and the warnings of <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc., with those of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc. Thus appears, as in other ways also, the carefully arranged plan of the Epistle, different in this respect from the undoubted Epistles of St. Paul, in which the thoughts generally follow each other without great regard to artistic arrangement. This, however, is in itself by no means conclusive against St. Paul's authorship, since there would be likely to be just this difference between a set treatise composed for a purpose, and a letter written <span class="accented">currente calamo</span> by the same author. It does, however, mark a different class of composition, and is suggestive, as far as it goes, of a different writer.

The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("new") applied to the "way" dedicated for us by Christ, though meaning originally, according to its etymology, "newly slain," is commonly used to express "recent" only. And so here. It is a new way in relation to the old one of the high priest through the veil - a way untrodden by man till opened and dedicated by "the <span class="accented">great</span> Priest." The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> ("living") applied to the way distinguishes it, as a spiritual mode of approach, from the old one. "Opponitur <span class="accented">exanimo.</span> Per prosopopoeiam <span class="accented">vita</span> adscribitur <span class="accented">viae</span>, ex ipsa <span class="accented">vita</span> Christi, qui est <span class="accented">Via"</span> (Bengel; see <a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). But what is the meaning of the <span class="accented">veil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the word always used of the veil in the tabernacle or temple) being said to be "his flesh "? The idea cannot be simply that he passed through the human nature assumed at his incarnation to the heavenly throne; for the intended counterpart to the high priest's passing through the veil must have been after the completed sacrifice. It is rather that, at the moment of death, when, after saying, "It is finished," he "gave up the ghost," the human flesh (which had through all the ages been as a veil hiding "<span class="accented">the</span> unseen" from man, and behind which Christ himself had "<span class="accented">tabernacled"</span> during his human life) was, as it were, rent asunder and the new way opened. And that this was so was signified by the rending in twain of the veil of the temple from the top to the bottom, mentioned by St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-51.htm">Matthew 26:51</a>), at the very moment of the death upon the cross. This incident may have suggested to the writer the expression used. "<span class="accented">Quum</span> primum Christus per momentum mortis transierat, praesto fuit mera <span class="accented">virtus</span> et <span class="accented">vita.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">carnem suam</span>, quae item scissa est, ut velum" (Bengel). "The house of God" in ver. 21 is a resumption of the thought of <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-7</a>, where Christ was shown to be greater than Moses, as being the SON <span class="accented">over</span> the house of God, having (be it observed) been called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 1.

We may now draw near to the very heavenly mercy-seat, without any sense of a bar to our doing so on the ground of consciousness of sin. In Christ we are to see accomplished all that is needed for atonement. But there are conditions also required in ourselves, expressed first by the "true heart," and the "fullness of faith," and then by the clauses that fellow. These clauses, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> have a liturgical basis - that of the blood-sprinkling (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> of the people with the blood of the covenant under Mount Sinai, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>, and of the priests on their consecration, <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-23.htm">Leviticus 8:23</a>) and of the ablutions before sacrificial service (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30</a>:39). Hence these two participial clauses are not to be separated from each other, and seem best to be both taken in connection with the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>. "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" means our having the inward consciousness of debarring sin removed through the blood of Christ; the "full assurance of faith" in the completed atonement, and the "true heart," being presupposed. The conjoined clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., is capable also of being figuratively interpreted, in the sense that "our sinful bodies" have been "made clean," so as to be offered through life acceptably as "a living sacrifice," as well as "our souls washed through his most precious blood." And this may be taken as implied. But the terms <span class="accented">body</span> and <span class="accented">water</span> after <span class="accented">hearts</span> and <span class="accented">blood</span> certainly suggest a direct reference to baptism. And such definite allusion is in keeping with references elsewhere to the beginning of the Christian life (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>).

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>, where it denotes the gathering together at the <span class="accented">Parousia.</span> In 2 Macc. 2:7, where alone it occurs in the LXX., it expresses the actual assembling of people together, as does the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, both in the LXX. and the New Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-27.htm">Mark 13:27</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-33.htm">Mark 1:33</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>). Hence, and in regard to the context as well as the etymology of the word, we may reject the less definite meaning, by some here assigned to it, of <span class="accented">Christian communion</span> (<span class="accented">conjugatio fidelium</span>), and the explanation of Bengel: "Sensus est, non modo debetis synagogam frequentare, ut Judaei, quod libentius facitis, sed etiam episynagogam, ut Christiani. Neque tamen innuitur praecise aggregatio ad unum locum, aut aggregatio ad unam <span class="accented">fidem</span>; sed, medio sensu, congregatio mutua <span class="accented">per amorem</span> et communicatio publica et privata officiorum Christianorum." The seen approach of the second advent (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>) is adduced as an additional argument against remissness. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> seems to imply more than the general belief in its imminence, founded on the language of Christ. It would seem as if the signs of the times were interpreted as denoting its approach (el. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). And it may be that they were rightly so interpreted in reference to the primary fulfillment of our Savior's words, though to that only, as the event proved. The blending together in the discourses of <a href="../../par/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, <a href="../../par/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>, <a href="../../par/luke/17.htm">Luke 17</a>. and 21, of the times of the fall of Jerusalem and of the final day, would naturally lead Christians to regard the signs of the first event as denoting the other also. And indeed the imminence of the first, of which the signs were really apparent, was in itself a peculiar reason why the Hebrew Christians should stick resolutely to Christianity, for its own sake and apart from Judaism. Else might their whole hold on Christ be loosened in the temple's fall Thus, though the writer might share in the mistaken view then prevalent of the imminence of the final day, his warning, founded on the supposed signs of it, hits well the peculiar needs of his readers.

But it is first to be observed that the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is not aorist, but present, expressing a persistent habit; also that the whole context is sufficient to denote the kind of sin intended. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the preceding verses have pointed to laxity of allegiance to Christ, which might have further consequences; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the illustration of what is meant, adduced in ver. 28 from the Mosaic Law, is (as will appear under that verse) a case of entire apostasy - a sin not to be atoned for by any sacrifice, but visited by "cutting off;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the description in ver. 29 of the sin intended implies total repudiation of Christ. Observe, on <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, the contrast to <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>, <span class="accented">al.</span>), expressive of sins of ignorance or infirmity. Not such sins, but deliberate sin with a high hand, is here intended; and further, for the reasons above given, one of this nature so heinous as to be beyond the reach of sacrifice. From all such considerations it appears that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> here expresses the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-6.htm">Hebrews 6:6</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>), viz. final obdurate defection from the faith. Further, the previous conditions for the possibility of arriving at such a hopeless state, set forth more at length in vers. 4, 5 of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, are here shortly expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which is to be interpreted in the light of the other passage (see note thereon). The consequences of such falling away are differently stated in the two passages. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, it was the impossibility of renewal unto repentance; here it is the absence of any further atoning sacrifice; and this in keeping with what has been now proved of the sacrifice of Christ having superseded all others and been "once for all." The drift is that, if this is deliberately rejected after full knowledge of it, no ether is left to have recourse to. Then the immediate mention of "judgment" is in keeping also with the conclusion of <a href="../../par/hebrews/9.htm">Hebrews 9</a>. (see note on Hebrews 9:27), and is immediately suggested here by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 25.

But the case contemplated here is that of its being "too late to cry for mercy, when it is the time of justice." Fearful (the writer would say) is the thought of being exposed, without possibility of escape or of atonement, to the wrath of the Eternal Righteousness. The inspired author of this Epistle had evidently an awful sense of the Divine wrath against sin, and of man's liability to it without atonement. He felt deeply the contradiction between humanity as it is and its ideal of perfection; and hence the wrath attributed to God in Holy Writ would appear to him as inseparable from a just conception of Divine holiness. For the more ardent the love in the human heart of moral good, by so much the keener is the indignation against moral evil, and the sense of the righteousness of retribution. The existence of such evil at all in the good God's universe is indeed a mystery; but, as long as it is there, we cannot but conceive the face of the holy God as set utterly against it; and so any revelation to us of the Divine nature would be imperfect did it not include the idea which is humanly expressed by such terms as "zeal," "jealousy," "wrath," "vengeance." Hence came the long-felt need of some atonement, to reconcile sinful man to the eternal holiness. This need was expressed of old by the institution of sacrifice, which, however - as is so clearly perceived in this Epistle - could never itself be really efficacious in the spiritual sphere of things. In the atonement of Christ (if rightly apprehended) is found at last a true satisfaction of this spiritual need. But, man's concurrence being still required, the idea of Divine wrath remains notwithstanding, as operative against such as, in deliberate perversity of free-will, after full knowledge, refuse to be thus reconciled. Hence the awful anticipations of future judgment on some, contained in this Epistle. The nature and duration of the doom to come, on such as remain subject to it, are in these passages left in obscurity. They speak only of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, an undefined expectation of something terrible. It may be observed, however, that, whatever be the force of other Scriptures in which the <span class="accented">fire</span> of that day is described as <span class="accented">eternal</span> and <span class="accented">unquenchable</span>, here at least the figure of a zeal of fire to <span class="accented">devour</span> the adversaries seems in itself to suggest rather utter destruction than perpetual pain.

Here certainly the context seems naturally to suggest a definite reference to baptism, as marking the date of the commencement of exposure to persecution. But if so, not, of course, so as to exclude the idea of inward spiritual enlightenment. "Hie primus erat ingressus ad Christianismum; baptismus apud idoneos salutare medium.

More than one such persecution might be in the writer's view, including, perhaps, that after the stoning of Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); that instituted by Herod Agrippa, under which James the elder suffered (<a href="../../par/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>.); that which led to the martyrdom of James the Just (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:09. 1) and others.

The meaning is that by endurance in doing the will they would receive. The full and final enjoyment of what is promised is still future and conditioned by perseverance. Observe the difference between the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, here used, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, used in <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>. The former (<span class="accented">occ</span>. <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19, 39</a>; also <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>; and <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-9.htm">1 Peter 1:9</a>) means the actual reception of what is denoted, equivalent to <span class="accented">sibi acquirere</span>; the latter (etc. <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>; also <a href="../../par/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-2.htm">James 4:2</a>) means only "to attain to," without involving full possession. It is not said of Abraham (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>) that he <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, only that he <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>. So also of all the faithful of old described in the following chapter (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>). And even to believing Christians, as this verse shows, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is still future and contingent.

But the just shall live by faith: and if he draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</span> In these verses, after the manner of the Epistle, what is being urged is supported by an Old Testament quotation (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3, 4</a>), its drift being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the certainty, notwithstanding delay, of the fulfillment of the Divine promise; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the necessity meanwhile of continuance in faith and perseverance. The quotation serves also as a step of transition (this, too, after the Epistle's manner) to the disquisition on <span class="accented">faith</span>, which forms the subject of the following chapter. For the prophet speaks of <span class="accented">faith</span> as what the righteous one is to live by until the Lord come. It was <span class="accented">faith -</span> a fuller faith - that the Hebrew Christians wanted to preserve them from the faltering of which they showed some signs; and the requirement of <span class="accented">faith</span> was no new thing - it had been the essential principle of all true religious life from the beginning, and thus is led up to the review which follows of the Old Testament history, showing that this had always been so. The quotation, as usual, is from the LXX., which, in this case as in some others, differs from the Hebrew. But here, as in ver. 29, <span class="accented">supra</span>, the LXX. is not exactly followed. The writer cites freely, so as to apply the essential meaning of the passage to his purpose. The Prophet Habakkuk (writing probably during the long evil days of Manasseh) had in his immediate view the trials of faith peculiar to his own time - violence and iniquity in Israel, and imminence of judgment at the hands of Chaldean conquerors, under which he had cried, "O Lord, how long?" But he stands upon his watch and sits upon his tower, to look out what the LORD will say to him in answer to his difficulties. And the LORD answered him, and said, "<span class="accented">Write</span> the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie [rather, 'but it hasteth to the end, and doth not lie']: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, and not tarry [or, 'be behindhand']. Behold, his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him [or, 'behold, his soul is lifted up, it is not upright in him']; but the just shall live by his faith." The drift of this Divine answer, which inspired the song of joyful confidence with which the Book of Habakkuk so beautifully concludes, is, as aforesaid, that, in spite of all appearances, the prophetic vision will ere long be realized; God's promises to the righteous will certainly be fulfilled; and that faith meanwhile must be their sustaining principle.

There is, however, good authority for reading it here after <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to "my Righteous One"). None of these variations from the LXX. affect the meaning of the passage, being only such as to point more clearly the intended application. One of the variations of the LXX. from the Hebrew (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc.) does alter the meaning of that particular clause, though not the general purport of the whole passage. The adoption here of the LXX. reading, and still more the fact that the following verse depends upon this reading, is among the strong evidences of the Epistle having been originally written, not in Hebrew, but in Greek.
