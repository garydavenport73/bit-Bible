The compound had its origin, doubtless, in the peripatetic school, denoting the right mean between passionateness and Stoic <span class="accented">apathy</span>, being the application of Aristotle's <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> to the sphere of the passions. Thus Diog. Laert. says of Aristotle, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>. In this sense Philo uses <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> to express Abraham's sober grief after the death of Sarah (2:37) and Jacob's patience under his afflictions (2:45). The verb, followed, as here, by a dative of persons, may be taken, therefore, to denote moderation of feeling towards the persons indicated, such moderation being especially opposed in the case before us, where the persons are the ignorant and erring, to excess of severe or indignant feeling. Moderation, indeed, in this regard seems to have been the idea generally attached to the compound (cf. Plut., 'De Ira Cohib.' p. 453, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Josephus also speaks of the emperors Vespasian and Titus as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in their attitude towards the Jews after long hostility ('Ant.,' 12:3 2). This, then, being the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it is obvious how the capacity of it is essential to the idea of a high priest as being one who is resorted to as a mediator by a people laden with infirmities, to represent them and to plead for them. It is not of necessity implied that every high priest was personally <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: it is the ideal of his office that is spoken cf. And, in the case of human high priests, this ideal was fulfilled by their being themselves human, encompassed themselves with the infirmity of those for whom they mediated. Christ also, so far, evidently fulfils the condition. For, though he is afterwards distinguished (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>) from priests having themselves infirmity, yet he had, in his human nature, experienced what it was: "He was crucified <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>); "Himself took our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), and bare our sicknesses" (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>); the agony in the garden (whatever its mysterious import, of which more below)expressed personal experience of human <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Alford denies that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense supposed by him to be here intended, can be attributed to Christ, and hence that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> can apply to him (but see above on Hebrews 4:15, and below on vers. 3, 7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And by reason hereof he ought</span> (or, is <span class="accented">bound</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</span> This obligation is evident in the case of the high priests of the Law. Consequently, their sin offering for themselves, in the first place, was a prominent part of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, which the writer may be supposed to have especially in view (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.). But can we suppose any corresponding necessity in the case of Christ? The argument does not absolutely require that we should, since the obligation of the Levitical high priest may be adduced only in proof of his own experience of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Christ, though under no such obligation, might still fulfill the requisites of a high priest, expressed in the case of sinful high priests by the obligation to offer for themselves; and we may (as Ebrard says) leave it to the writer to show hew he does fulfill them. Whether, however, there was in Christ's own experience anything corresponding to the high priest's offering for himself will be considered under vers. 7, 8. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as <i>was</i> Aaron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but being called of God</span> (the 5 of Textus Receptus before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "he that is called," as in A.V. - has very slight authority), <span class="cmt_word">even as was Aaron.</span> This verse expresses the second essential of a high priest, Divine appointment, for assurance of the efficacy of his mediation. Of course Aaron's successors derived their Divine commission from his original one (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a High Priest</span>. Here begins the proof that Christ fulfils the two requirements, that mentioned second in the previous statement being taken first in the proof - <span class="accented">chiastically</span>, as is usual in this Epistle. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>, may have reference to the glory wherewith Christ is crowned in his exalted position as Priest-King (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek</span>. These two texts (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>) must be taken together for the proof required. The first (commented on under Hebrews 1:5) shows the Lord's appointment of Christ to his kingly office as Son; the second shows that this kingly office carries with it, also by Divine appointment, an eternal priesthood. Christ's entry into this kingly priesthood is best conceived as inaugurated by his resurrection, after accomplishment of human obedience, whereby he fitted himself for priesthood. Before this he was the destined High Priest, but not the "perfected" High Priest, "ever living to make intercession for <span class="accented">us</span>." It is not during his life on earth, but after his exaltation, that he is spoken of as the High Priest of mankind. In his sufferings and death he was consecrated to his eternal office. This appears from vers. 9, 10, and also from <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, quoted in this verse, where the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek and the exaltation to the right hand of God are regarded together. See also what was said under Hebrews 1:5, of the application to Christ of the other text quoted, "This day have I begotten thee." The Messianic reference and general drift of <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. has been considered under Hebrews 1:13. It was there seen to be more than a <span class="accented">typical</span> prophecy, David having in it a distinct view of One far greater than himself - of the Son to come, whom he calls his LORD. But even had it, like other Messianic psalms, a primary reference to some theocratic king, the remarkable import of ver. 4 would in itself point beyond one. For, though David organized and controlled the priesthood and the services of the sanctuary, though both he and Solomon took a prominent part in solemn acts of worship, yet neither they nor any other king assumed the priestly office, which, in its essential functions, was scrupulously confined to the sons of Aaron. The judgment on Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-22</a>) is a notable evidence of the importance attached to this principle. Yet the verse before us assigns a true priesthood to the future King. For Melchizedek, as he appears in Genesis, is evidently a true priest, though prior to the Aaronic priesthood, uniting in himself, according to the system of the patriarchal age, the royalty and the priesthood of his race: as a true priest, he blessed Abraham, and received tithes from him. But of him, historically and symbolically regarded, the consideration must be reserved for <a href="../../par/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where the subject is taken up. Enough here to observe that in <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. a true and everlasting priesthood is assigned to the SON in union with his exalted royalty at the LORD'S right hand, and this by Divine appointment, by the "<span class="accented">voice"</span> or "<span class="accented">oracle"</span> of the Load (ver. 1), confirmed by the LORD'S oath (ver. 4).

This main intention of vers. 7, 8 must be kept in mind for a proper understanding of them. Christ is in them regarded, not as executing his priestly office, but as being prepared and consecrated for it. His eternal priesthood is conceived as entered on <span class="accented">after</span> the human experience which is the subject of these verses (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (ver. 9), and what was said under ver. 5). With regard to the participial aorists, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, it is a misapprehension of their proper force to regard them as denoting a time <span class="accented">previous</span> to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8; as if the meaning were - having in Gethsemane "offered," etc., and "been heard," he <span class="accented">afterwards</span> "learnt obedience" on the cross. All they express is that in offering, etc., and being heard, he learned obedience. The idea of subsequent time does not come in till ver. 9; "and being perfected," after thus learning obedience, "he became," etc. Thus the only question with regard to <span class="accented">time</span> in vers. 7, 8 is whether they have reference to the agony in the garden only, or both to the agony and the cross. That they refer mainly, if not exclusively, to the agony is evident from the expressions used, corresponding so closely with the Gospel history. The view presented is, as in the Gospels, of some intense inward struggle, outwardly manifested, and expressing itself in repeated prayers (observe the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) aloud for deliverance. It is true that the Gospels, as we have them now, do not mention <span class="accented">tears</span>; but these too are quite in keeping with the bloody sweat specified by St. Luke, and Epiphanius states that the original copies of <a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43, 44</a> contained the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. Some interpreters would identify <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of ver. 7 with the "loud voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>)" from the cross (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). But there is nothing to suggest this; the "strong crying and tears" evidently denote the manner of the "prayers and supplications;" and the thrice-repeated prayer in the garden recorded by the evangelists may be well conceived to have been thus loudly uttered, so as to be heard by the three <span class="accented">disciples</span>, a stone's cast distant, before sleep overcame them. "In cruce clamasse dicitur; lachrymasse non dicitur. Utrum horum respicit locum Gethsemane" (Bengel). What, then, as seen in the light of these verses, was the meaning of the "prayer and supplications" in the garden of Gethsemane? The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, confirms the view that the "cup" which he prayed might pass from him, was the death before him, and that the purport of his prayer was, not to be raised from death after undergoing it, but to be saved from undergoing it. Such is the ordinary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in reference to one still alive (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-19.htm">Psalm 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). It does not indeed positively follow that, because he prayed to One who was able in this sense to save him, his prayer was that he might be in this sense saved. It is, however, the natural inference. But, if so, two difficulties present themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> How was such a prayer consistent with his distinct knowledge that death must be undergone, and his late strong rebuke to Peter for venturing to dissuade him from it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> How can he be said to have been <span class="accented">heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), since he was not saved from death in the sense intended? To the first of these questions the answer is that the prayer expressed, not the deliberate desire of his Divine will, but only the inevitable shrinking of the human will from such an ordeal as was before him. As man, he experienced this shrinking to the full, and as man he craved deliverance, though with entire submission to the will of the Father. His human will did not oppose itself to the Divine will: it conformed itself in the end entirely to it; but this according to the necessary conditions of humanity, through the power of prayer. Had it not been so with him, his participation in human nature would have been incomplete; he would not have been such as to be "touched with a feeling of our infirmities, being in all things tempted like as we are;" nor would he have stood forth for ever as the great Example to mankind. St. John, who so deeply enters into and interprets the mind of Christ, records an utterance before the agony which anticipates its meaning (<a href="../../par/john/12.htm">John 12</a>): "The hour is come" (ver. 23); and then (ver. 27), "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour [cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>]; but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy Name." The "hour" was that of the drinking of the cup (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/14-35.htm">Mark 14:35</a>, "And prayed that, if it were possible, the <span class="accented">hour</span> might pass from him"). "Father, save me from this hour" was the human craving of the agony; but still, "Father, glorify thy Name" was the essence of the prayer; and perfect submission to the Divine will was the outcome of it, after this <span class="accented">troubling</span> of his human soul. The mystery surrounding the whole subject of the Divine and human in Christ remains still. What was said with regard to it about the temptation in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) is applicable also here. If it be further asked how it was that Christ, in his humanity, so shrank from the "cup" before him, seeing that mere men have been found to face death calmly in its most appalling forms, the answer may be found in the consideration of what this cup implied. It was more than physical death, more than physical pain, more than any sorrow that falls to the lot of man.

Of the <span class="accented">second</span> difficulty mentioned above, as to how Christ was "heard," not having been saved "from death" in the apparent sense of his prayer, the solution may be that the prayer, conditioned as it was by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, was most truly answered by the angel sent to strengthen him, and the power thenceforth given him to "endure the cross, despising the shame." "Mortem ex qua Pater cum liberare posset, ne moreretur, tamen subiit, voluntati Patris obediens: ab horrore plane liberatus est per exauditionem Exauditus est, non ut ne biberet calicem, sed ut jam sine ullo horrore biberet: unde etiam per angelum corroboratus est" (Bengel). The example to us thus becomes the more apparent. For we, too, praying legitimately for release from excessive trial, may have our prayer best answered by grace given to endure the trial, and by "a happy issue" out of it; as was the case with Christ. For his bitter passion was made the path to eternal glory; and thus in the Resurrection too his prayer was answered.

The objection to the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> to express the <span class="accented">cause</span> of his being heard is met by reference to the frequent usage of St. Luke, whose language most resembles that of our Epistle.

The phrase, thus understood, brings out the more markedly the thoroughly human conditions to which Christ was subjected. It was not in right of his sonship that he was heard. He won his hearing by his human piety; though he was SON, and as such knew that his Father heard him always (<a href="../../par/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>), he learnt humanly his lesson of obedience. In the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Son</span> is surely meant in the peculiar sense in which it has all along been applied to Christ, expressing more than that his relation to God was that of <span class="accented">any</span> son to a father, and thus we perceive the full force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>. It is true that it was not till after the Resurrection that he attained his exalted position as SON (see under Hebrews 1:5 and Hebrews 5:5); but still he was all along the Son, in virtue of his origin as well as of his destiny. Cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not indeed, in itself, express that he was the Second Person of the Trinity (this application of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being nowhere found in the Epistle); but it implies that, even in his state of humiliation, he was more than man; for there would be nothing very extraordinary, so as to justify <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, in the case of an ordinary son learning obedience to his father through suffering. Recurring now to the question raised under ver. 3, whether the high priest's obligation to offer in the first place for himself had any counterpart in the case of Christ, we may perceive such a counterpart in the agony, as above regarded. For, although for himself Christ needed no atonement, yet the "prayers and supplications" were offered in his own behalf, being due to his own entire participation in the conditions of humanity; the whole "agony and bloody sweat" were part of his own preparation and consecration for executing the office of a High Priest for others, and, like the Aaronic priest's offering for himself, they were the sign and evidence of his being one <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.

It may be (though not necessarily so) that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 7, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 3, is intended to suggest this analogy.

Hence, and in view of the drift of the passage before us, Jackson very decidedly regards <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 9 as a <span class="accented">verbum solenne</span>, denoting specifically Christ's <span class="accented">consecration</span> to his eternal office of High Priest. So also Hammond and Whitby. Being thus perfected, or consecrated, he became, for ever afterwards, the Author, not of mere ceremonial cleansing or temporary remission of guilt, but of eternal salvation; <span class="accented">potentially</span> to all mankind (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), and <span class="accented">effectively to</span> "<span class="accented">all</span> them that obey him;" being addressed, in tiffs his consummated position (the reference being to <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) as "High Priest for ever," etc. Here again we perceive that it is not till after the Resurrection that the prophetic ideal of the SON at God's right hand, and of the eternal High Priest, are regarded as fully realized. If it be objected that his high priesthood must have begun <span class="accented">before</span> the Resurrection for his death upon the cross to be a true atonement, it may be replied that his one oblation of himself upon the cross at once consummated his consecration and effected the atonement. Doubtless, as a true High Priest on earth, he thus "offered one sacrifice for sins for ever" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>); all that is meant above is that it was not till after the Resurrection that he entered on his eternal office of mediation in virtue of that one accomplished sacrifice.

He is entering on a new theme, higher and less level to the comprehension of his readers than any that has gone before. Even so far, we have seen how their Jewish prejudices had evoked admonitions, frequently interposed in the course of the argument. Much more so now, when it is to be shown how the priesthood of Christ not only fulfils the idea of, but also supersedes, that of the sons of Aaron, being of a different order from theirs. The region of thought to be entered now, being that of "<span class="accented">the</span> mystery of Christ," transcends more than any that has been so far entered the ordinary conceptions of traditional Judaism. Hence the writer's shrinking from entering all at once on the subject for fear of not being even understood; hence his earnest warnings to his readers as to the necessity of advancing to the state of full-grown Christians who can discern spiritual things. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>. - INTERPOSED EXHORTATION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of whom</span> (the most obvious antecedent being Melchizedek, but with regard to his typical significance, as referred to in <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">we have many things to say</span> (the subject itself admits a lengthy exposition) and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become (not, as in A.V., "ye are") dull of hearing, Their dullness is the reason of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It was not that the subject was in itself inexplicable, or that the writer was incompetent to explain it; his difficulty was in adapting the interpretation to the capacity of his readers: "Non scribentis, sed vestro vitio" (Bengel). It seems from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("ye are become"), in this and the following verse, that the Hebrew Christians had even retrograded in spiritual perception. This is easily conceivable. As, through the teaching of St. Paul especially, the tie between Christianity and Judaism became more and more broken, there was likely to be a certain reaction among the Hebrew Christians, who, having gone to a certain extent with the tide of thought, became conscious how far it was carrying them. They would be inclined to cling the more fondly to their old associations from the fear of losing them altogether. Such retrogressions have been observable in other times of upheaval of old ideas.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("oracles"), is used elsewhere for the revelations of the Old Testament, as <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>. Here its meaning can hardly be taken as confined to them, since the first principles of the gospel are being spoken cf. Still, a word that includes them in its meaning may be purposely used by way of intimating that the elements intended are those of Judaism as well as Christianity, or of the latter only in its first emergence out of Judaism. And accordingly, vers. 1, 2 of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, where they are enumerated, are (as will be seen) so worded as to imply no more than this; nor are the first principles there mentioned beyond what an enlightened Jew might be expected to understand readily. Be it observed that the Hebrew Church need not be supposed to have actually lost sight of these first principles, so as to require a new indoctrination into them. There may be a vein of delicate irony in what is said, after the manner of St. Paul. All that is of necessity implied is that there had been such a failure in seeing what these principles led to as to suggest the necessity of their being learnt anew. The writer does not, in fact, as he goes on, require them to be learnt anew; for he bids his readers leave them behind, as though already known, and proceed from them to perfection, though still with some misgiving as to their capability for doing so. The figure of milk for babes and solid food for full-grown men, to illustrate the teaching suitable for neophytes and for advanced Christians, is found also in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1, 2</a>; and that of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>. This correspondence, though no proof of the Pauline authorship, is among the evidences of the Pauline character of the Epistle.

There is no need to suppose an exclusive reference to the more perfect doctrine in opposition to the elements, since, of the whole subject of religious knowledge, the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be said to be <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of being without the matured skill that experience gives. Hence, too, we are certainly not justified in finding in the phrase a specific allusion to the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith only, which is not suggested by the context or by what follows. Still less may we (with Delitzsch) so ignore the notable significance of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as to reduce the expression to a synonym for "rightly framed, that is sound and orthodox discourse."

So, in the spiritual sphere, the mental faculties, exercised at first on simple truths, should acquire by practice the power of apprehending and distinguishing' between higher and more recondite ones. It was because the Hebrew Christians had failed thus to bring out their faculties that they were open to the charge of being still in a state of infancy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hebrews/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hebrews 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hebrews 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hebrews/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hebrews 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hebrews 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
