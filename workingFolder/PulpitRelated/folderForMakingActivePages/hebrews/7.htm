But we have only to enter into the mind of the writer to see that it is not so. For it is the ideal of the psalm, conceived as suggested by the historical type, that gives its color to the language used. And, indeed, how strangely suggestive is that fragment about the priestly king (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-21</a>) so unexpectedly interposed in the life of Abraham! In the midst of a history in which such a point is made of the parentage and descent of the patriarchs of Israel, at a time of peculiar glory of the first and greatest of them, one suddenly appears on the scene, a priest and king, not of the peculiar race at all, his parentage and ancestry unrecorded and unknown, who blesses and receives tithes from Abraham, and then as suddenly disappears from view. We hear no more of him; as about his origin, so about his end, Scripture is silent. And so he "abides" before the mind's eye, apart from any before or after, the type of an unchanging priesthood. For the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in itself denoting the absence, not of ancestors, but of a traced genealogy), cf. ver. 6, 6 <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. That of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, is illustrated by the Latin expression, "Nullis majoribus ortus." On "made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) unto the Son of God," Chrysostom says, "We know of no beginning or end in either case; in the one, because none are recorded; in the other, because they do not exist." The idea seems to be that Melchizedek is thus assimilated to Christ in the sacred record, by what it leaves untold no less than by what it tells. It is not said that he is like him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), but made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> represented in such wise as to resemble him. It may be here remarked that, though the term "Son of God" is used in the Epistle generally to denote the Messiah as manifested in time, his essential eternal being is here, as elsewhere, distinctly intimated; also that "the Son of God" is regarded as the archetype of the comparison: "Non dicitur Filius DEI assimilatus Melchizedeko, sed contra; nam Filius DEI est antiquior et archetypus" (Bengel).

The typical significance of Melchizedek is now further seen in what passed between him and Abraham, in respect to tithe and blessing. Alford's inference, that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, referring as it does, not to the antitype, but to the man himself, implies some mysterious greatness beyond what appears in the original record, does not follow. Of one who simply blessed and received tithes from the great patriarch, the expression is not too strong. Observe the emphatic position, at the end of the Greek sentence, of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "he, the patriarch." Abraham's being this, the father and representative of the chosen race, is what is shown in what follows to give peculiar significance to the transaction. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (properly, "the chief spoils"), which is not in the LXX., seems introduced to enhance the picture: "Quae Abrahami proprie fuerant, ut victoris" (Bengel). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-5.htm">Hebrews 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they indeed of the song of Levi who receive the office of priesthood have commandment to receive tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham: but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath received tithes of Abraham</span>. As much as to say, "Let it not be said that the tithing of Abraham by Melchizedek implies no higher priestly prerogative than the tithing of Abraham's descendants by the sons of Aaron; for there is this difference: They, in virtue only of a special ordinance of the Law, not of original right, were allowed to tithe their brethren, though descended from the same great ancestor; he, though not of them or of the race at all, in virtue of his own inherent dignity, tithes the whole race as represented in its patriarch." (We observe how, in place of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, used when the mere historical incident was referred to, we have here the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> (as also <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> in what follows, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 9), denoting a completed act, of which the effects and significance remain; Melchizedek, who represents the priesthood after his order, being viewed in permanent relation to Abraham, who represents the chosen race.) And hath blessed him that hath (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the holder of) the promises. But, without all controversy, the less is blessed of the better. The superiority evidenced by bestowal of blessing no less than by receiving of tithe having been thus noticed, the contrast with the Levitical priesthood is continued in the following verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-6.htm">Hebrews 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</div><div class="comm">

The difference here noted is between a succession of mortal priests and one perpetually living, who never loses his personal claim, which is inherent, in himself. But how so of Melchizedek? For it is to him, and not to Christ the Antitype, that the words evidently apply. Is it at length implied that he was more than mortal man? No, if only for this reason; that the witness appealed to (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) must be that of Scripture, which nowhere bears such witness of the historical Melchizedek. The words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;</span>, are, in fact, only a resumption of what was said in ver. 3: "having neither beginning of days nor end of life;" and hear the same meaning; viz. (as above explained) that he passes before our view in Genesis with no mention of either death, birth, or ancestry, and thus presented the ideal of "a priest for ever" to the inspired psalmist. The witness referred to is that of the record in Genesis, viewed in the light of the idea of the psalm. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-9.htm">Hebrews 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes.</span> <span class="cmt_word">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</span> Or, in other words, "Nay, further, Melchizedek may be said to have tithed Levi himself and his priestly tribe." For, inasmuch as the whole position of Levi and his tribe, in the old dispensation, came by inheritance from the great patriarch who received the promises, the subordination of the patriarch to one above himself involved that of all who so inherited, it is not simply the physical descent of Levi from Abraham, but the peculiar position of the latter as "the patriarch," that justifies the assertion that Levi paid tithes through him. And thus, while we remember how Abraham is elsewhere viewed in Scripture as the representative of the chosen people, and also how the lives of individual patriarchs (notably so in the case of Jacob and Esau) are so told and referred to as to prefigure the positions and fortunes of the races they represent, we may recognize in this assertion no mere rabbinical fancy, but an interpretation true to the spirit of the Old Testament. Be it further observed that the original significance of Abraham's action as bearing upon his descendants is enhanced by the fact that, while it was <span class="accented">after</span> the receiving of the promise, it was <span class="accented">before</span> the birth of Isaac. He, and consequently his descendant Levi, was yet (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) in the loins of Abraham; on which point, "Proles e parenlis poteslate egressa in suam venit tutelain: sod quoad in parentis potestate, imo in lumbis est, illius conditionem sequitur" (Bengel).

So far the superiority of the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek to the Aaronic has been shown. The new thought is that the very mention in the psalm of a different order of priesthood implies that the old order, and with it the whole legal dispensation which depended on it, was imperfect and to be superseded. This is the general drift of vers. 11, 12, though the sequence of thought in their several clauses is not easy to follow. Ideas in the writer's mind, not expressed, seem necessary to be understood. In the parenthetical clause of ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are decidedly to be preferred, on the ground of authority, to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> of the Textus Receptus. 'The meaning of the clause (whatever be the precise thought connecting it with the sentence in which it stands) is that the whole Law rested on the institution of the priesthood; not the priests only, but the whole people (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), received their Law as grounded on it. On the same idea depends ver. 12, where it is said that a change of the priesthood involves of necessity a change of the Law. The verses next following serve to remove all doubt that there <span class="accented">is</span> a complete change of the priesthood; the proofs being, not only the patent fact that the Messiah is of the tribe, not of Levi, but of Judah (vers. 13, 14), but also, for mere abundant evidence of the Divine purpose, that significant utterance, again adduced, about his being after the order, not of Aaron, but of Melchizedek (vers. 15, 16, 17).

For it is to Christian believers, with whatever Jewish prejudices, not to unbelieving Jews, that the Epistle is addressed. It is important to observe that the Davidic descent of our Lord is spoken of as an acknowledged fact, not merely as an inference from prophecy. "We have here a most significant proof that the descent of Jesus from the tribe of Judah was a well and universally known fact before the destruction of Jerusalem" (Ebrard). "Illo igitur tempore nulla difficultate laborabat genealogia Jesu Christi: et hoc ipsum difficultatibus postea exortis abunde medetur" (Bengel).

But two proofs are first to be given of Christ's priesthood being, unlike the Aaronic, thus eternally availing to bring us near to God. These proofs are to be found in the Divine oath which established it, and the expression, "forever," in <a href="../../par/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, once more adduced.

(Observe the first occurrence here of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, introducing in the way of hint (as is usual in the Epistle) an idea to be afterwards expanded, as it is in <a href="../../par/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8</a>. and 9. The meaning of the word will be considered below.)

The repetitions are not tautological, having each time different bearings. The contrast here, as before, is between mortal men who succeed each other in the office of priesthood, and One who has the office inherent in himself forever. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "unchangeable") is taken by some in an intransitive sense, as in margin of the A.V., <span class="accented">that doth not pass to another</span>, equivalent <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

Here it is the perpetual intercession of Christ before the heavenly mercy-seat. In the view of his office thus arrived at there is, in fact, a transition to the main subject set forth in the three chapters that follow; viz. the fulfillment in Christ of the ceremonial of the Law, and especially of the high priest's intercession on the Day of Atonement. And thus from Melchizedek the train of thought passes to the high priest. The type of the former has been sufficiently shown to be fulfilled in the <span class="accented">higher order</span> of Christ's priesthood; it is now to be shown how, being of such higher order, it is the antitype of the Aaronic priesthood too, accomplishing what it signified. Hence in ver. 26 the word "high priest" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) is for the first time introduced, as the key-note of what is coming. <span class="accented">Summary of the foregoing argument.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1-11</a>.)

It was there said that to make the Captain of our salvation perfect through suffering "became" God - was befitting to what we conceive of the Divine nature. It is now said that our High Priest's being such as is here described "became" us - was befitting to our state and needs. That he should be both human and superhuman was in all respects fitting - the one that he might be our sympathizing brother; the other that his intercession might avail. The further description of him in this verse is suggested by the qualifications of the Aaronic high priest, what they typified being realized in Christ. The high priest was by his consecration a holy person, <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6, 8</a>, etc.); he bore on his miter "<span class="accented">Holiness to the Lord"</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>); he must be without personal blemish (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>, etc.); he must keep himself continually from all ceremonial pollution (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a>. and 22.); he must purify himself by a sacrifice for himself and by special ablutions before entering the holy of holies (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.); when there, he was conceived as in God's presence, apart from the world of sinners outside.

There are two tenable solutions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the daily offerings of the priests are regarded as made by the high priest, who represented the whole priesthood, on the principle, <span class="accented">qui facit per altos tacit per se</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (as is suggested by its position in the sentence) belongs not to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, but only to Christ: "<span class="accented">who</span> <span class="accented">has no need daily, as the high priests have yearly</span>:" for <span class="accented">his</span> intercession being perpetual, an offering on his part would be needed daily, if needed at all. This view is supported by the fact that the <span class="accented">daily</span> sacrifices are not spoken of in the Law as including a special one in the first place for the priest's own sin. "This he did." Did what? Offer for his own sins as well as for the people's? No; for, though it has been seen above (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) how the high priest's offering for himself might have its counterpart in the agony, the Sinless One cannot be said to have offered for sins of his own.

We must, therefore, take "this he did" as referring only to the latter part of the preceding clause, while <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> answers to the former part; or as implying generally, "did all that was needed for atonement."
