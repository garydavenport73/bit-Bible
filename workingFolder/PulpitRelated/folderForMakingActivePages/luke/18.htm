The formnla <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, literally, "and he spake also," calls attention to the fact that the parable-teaching immediately to follow was a continuation of what had preceded. Indeed, the connection between the first of the two parables, which urges restless continued prayer, and the picture which the Lord had just drawn of men's state of utter forgetfulness of God, is obvious. "The Son of man has been rejected; he has gone from view; the masses are plunged in gross worldliness; men of God are become as rare as, in the days of Abraham, they were in Sodom. What, then, is the position of the Church? That of a widow whose only weapon is incessant prayer. It is only by means of this intense concentration that faith will be preserved. But such is precisely the disposition which Jesus fears may not be found even in the Church at his return" (Godet). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-2.htm">Luke 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man</span>. Probably enough the whole scene was a sketch from life; under such a rule as that of Herod Antipas there were, doubtless, judges of the character here portrayed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-3.htm">Luke 18:3</a></div><div class="verse">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary</span>. The petitioner was a woman and a widow, the latter being in the East a synonym for helplessness. With no one to defend her or plead her cause, this widow was ever a prey to the covetous. Not once nor twice in the noble generous words of the chivalrous Hebrew prophets we find this readiness on the part of those in power to neglect, if not to oppress these helpless widow-women, sternly commented upon. So in Isaiah we read (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>), "They judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them." While Jesus (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>) includes this cowardly sin among the evil deeds of the rulers of the Israel of his day: "Ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer." A more desperate situation, as regards any hope of obtaining the object of her earnest prayer, could not well be pictured - a careless, corrupt judge of the lawless Herod period for the tribunal in Israel, and a poor helpless widow for the suppliant. The forlorn woman of the parable represents the Church or people of God in dire straits, overborne by an unbelieving world and seemingly forgotten even of their God. The story is a reminder that there is hope even in that extreme situation sketched in the parable, if the petitioner only continues persistent in her prayer. The argument which lies on the surface of the parable, teaching is obvious: if such a judge will in the end listen to the prayer of a suppliant for whom he cares nothing, will not God surely listen to the repeated prayer of a suppliant whom he loves with a deep, enduring love? Such is the argument of the story. Importunity, it seems to say, must inevitably triumph. But underlying this there is much deep teaching, of which, perhaps, the most important item is that it insists upon the urgent necessity for us all to continue in prayer, never fainting in this exercise though no answer seems to come. "The whole limb of the faithful," as Origen once grandly said, "should be one great connected prayer." That is the real moral of the story; but there are a number of minor bits of Divine teaching contained in this curious parable setting, as we shall see. <span class="accented">Avenge me of mine adversary.</span> We must not suppose that mere vengeance in  the vulgar sense is what the widow prayed for; <span class="accented">that</span> would be of no use to her; all she wanted was that the judge should deliver her from the oppression which her adversary exercised over her, no doubt in keeping from her the heritage to which she was lawfully entitled. Of course, the granting her prayer would revolve loss and possibly punishment to her fraudulent oppressor.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him?</span> The Master tells us that God permits suffering among his servants, long after they have begun to pray for deliverance. But we are counselled here to cry day and night unto him, and, though there be no signor reply, our prayers shall be treasured up before him, and in his own good time they will be answered. Though he bear long with them. With whom does God bear long? With the wrong-doers, whose works and words oppress and make life heavy and grievous to the servants of God; with <span class="accented">these</span> who have no claim to consideration will God bear long. And this announcement gives us some clue to the meaning of the delay we often experience before we get an answer to many of our prayers. The prayer is heard, but God, in the exercise of mercy and forbearance, has dealings with the oppressors. It were easy for the Almighty to grant an immediate answer, but only at the cost often of visiting some of the oppressors with immediate punishment, and this is not his way of working. God bears long before his judgments swift and terrible are sent forth. This has ever been his way of working with individuals as with nations. Was it not thus, for instance, that he acted towards Egypt and her Pharaohs during the long period of the bitter Hebrew bondage? We who would he God's servants must be content to wait God's time, and, while waiting, patiently go on pleading, sure that in the end "God will avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a></div><div class="verse">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily</span>. "Non <span class="accented">bientot, mais bien rite"</span> (Godet). It means that God will act in accordance with his servant's prayer, not soon, but suddenly; sure and sudden at the crisis the action of Divine providence comes at the last "as a thief in the night." <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</span> These difficult words seem to point at least to a fear lest, the second coming being long delayed, true faith would have died out of the hearts even of the godly. Such a <span class="accented">fear</span> might be Jesus'; for we know, from his own lips, that to him, while on earth and wearing the body of humiliation, the day and hour of the second advent was not known. Was not our Lord speaking with the same sad onlook in his parable of the virgins, when he said, "they <span class="accented">all</span> slumbered and slept," wise virgins as well as foolish (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-5.htm">Matthew 25:5</a>)? "It is often the case that God's action as a Deliverer is delayed until his people have ceased to hope for deliverance. So it was with Israel in Egypt; so was it with her again in Babylon. ' Grief was calm and hope was dead' among the exiles when the word came that they were to return to their own land; and then the news seemed too good to be true. They were 'like them that dream' when they heard the good tidings. This method of Divine action - long delay followed by a sudden crisis - so frankly recognized by Christ, is one to which we find it hard to reconcile ourselves. These parables help us so far, but they do not settle everything. They contain no philosophy of Divine delay, but simply a proclamation of the fact, and an assurance that, in spite of delay, all will go well at the last with those who trust in God" (Professor Bruce). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake this parable</span>. With this parable, "the Pharisee and the publican," St. Luke concludes his memories of the last journeyings toward Jerusalem. The incidents which directly follow took place close to Jerusalem; and here St. Luke's narrative rejoins that of SS. Matthew and Mark. No note of time or place assists us in defining exactly the period when the Master spoke this teaching; some time, however, in these last journeyings, that is, in the closing months of the public ministry, the parable in question was certainly spoken. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-10.htm">Luke 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican</span>. This parable constitutes an important chapter in Jesus' apology or defence - if we may dare use the word - for loving the sinful, for consorting with publicans and sinners. It tells men, in very simple language, how they are saved; not by works of righteousness which they have done, but of grace; in other words, by God's free mercy. Jewish religious society in the time of our Lord, as represented by the great Pharisee sect, totally misunderstood this Divine truth. They claimed salvation as a right on two grounds: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because they belonged to the chosen race; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because they rigidly and minutely obeyed the precepts of a singular code of laws, many of them devised by themselves and their fathers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Upon these two grounds they claimed salvation, that is, eternal blissful life. Not content with this claim of their own, they condemned, with a sweeping, harsh condemnation, all other peoples, and even those of their own race who neglected rigidly to observe the ordinances and ritual of a law framed in great measure in the  schools of their own rabbis. Two extreme instances are here chosen - a rigid, exclusive, self-satisfied member of the religious society of Israel; and a Jewish officer of the hated Roman government, who knew little or nothing of the Law, but yet who longed after a higher life, and craved for an inward peace which he evidently was far from possessing. These two, the Pharisee and the publican, both went up to God's holy house, the temple, with a view of drawing near to the eternal King. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a></div><div class="verse">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <i>are</i>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are</span>. How closely drawn from the life is this picture of a Pharisee will be seen by a comparison of the prayer here with the prayer of a rabbi contained in the Talmud. When Rabbi Nechounia Ben Hakana left his school, he used to say, "I thank thee, O Eternal, my God, for having given me part with those who attend this school instead of running through the shops. I rise early like them, but it is to study the Law, not for futile ends. I take trouble as they do, but I shall be rewarded, and they will not. We run alike, but I for the future life, while they will only arrive at the pit of destruction" (from the treatise 'Berachath'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a></div><div class="verse">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I fast twice in the week</span>. There was no such precept in the Law of Moses. There only a single fast-day in the year was enjoined, <span class="accented">the Day of Atonement</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>). By the time of Zechariah the prophet (Zechariah 8:19) the one fast-day had grown into four. But this fasting twice every week was a burthensome observance imposed in the later oral Law. Thursday and Monday were the appointed fasting-days, because tradition related how, on those days, Moses ascended and descended from Sinai. Compare the Talmud (treatise 'Bava Khama,' fol. 82. 1). <span class="cmt_word">I give tithes of all that I possess</span>. Here, again, the Mosaic ordinance only enjoined tithes of corn, wine, oil, and cattle. The later rabbinic schools directed that everything should be tithed, down to the mint and anise and cummin. And so this poor deluded Pharisee dreamed he had earned his eternal salvation, <span class="accented">forgetting</span> that the tithes he so prided himself on paying were merely tithes of goods of which he was steward for a little time, tithes, too, given back to their real Owner - God. Could this be counted <span class="accented">a claim</span> upon God? He boasted, too, that he was no extortioner: did he forget how often he had coveted? He was no adulterer: what of those wicked thoughts which so often found a home in his heart? He rejoiced that he was not like the publican and others of that same class: did he think of the sore temptations to which these and the like were exposed, and from which he was free? He gloried in his miserable tithes and offerings: did he remember how really mean and selfish he was? did he think of his luxury and abundance, and of the want and misery of thousands round him? did his poor pitiful generosity constitute a <span class="accented">claim</span> to salvation? All this and more is shrined in the exquisite story of Jesus, who shows men that salvation - if it be given to men at all - must be given entirely as a free gift of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <i>his</i> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!</span> Utterly sad and heart-broken, the publican neither recounts nor thinks of good kind deeds done, or special sins committed; no thoughts came into that poor heart, such as, "I have done some fair deeds; I am not altogether vile and sinful." He felt that with him evil so far overbalanced good that he could make no plea for himself, and yet he, too, longed for salvation, so he threw himself wholly upon God's mercy and love in his sad prayer, "God be merciful to me the sinner!" for so the words should be rendered. Different to the Pharisee, who thought himself better than his neighbours, this man, in his sad humility, evidently thought other men better than himself, but still he so trusted in God that he felt even for him, the sinner, there might be mercy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a></div><div class="verse">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <i>rather</i> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted</span>. And the publican was right; there was mercy even for him, all sin-stained though he was. The words with which the Lord closes his teaching are full of comfort. <span class="accented">That</span> prayer he tells us was heard and granted. The "I tell you" of Jesus here means, as Stier well puts it, "I <span class="accented">tell you</span>, for I know, I have seen, I have heard all this in many such a case, and in many such prayers." With this example of prayer favourably heard, there is surely no sin-burthened soul on earth who may not take courage in seeking God's face. One great object of this parable, we may believe, was to suggest some such thoughts, to embolden sorrowful, heart-broken sinners simply to go to God, trusting in his great pitying love. It should not be forgotten that the publican's prayer was heard <span class="accented">in the temple</span>; a silent approval seems given to his having thus sought out the appointed consecrated place of prayer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-15.htm">Luke 18:15</a></div><div class="verse">And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when <i>his</i> disciples saw <i>it</i>, they rebuked them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-30.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus and the children.

Our Lord's noticing children is several times alluded to in the Gospels. There was something evidently in his look and manner which singularly attracted little ones to him. SS. Matthew and Mark both recount this blessing of the children immediately after the teaching on divorce. Our Lord thus sanctifies the bond of marriage and its legitimate offspring. It was a silent but powerful reply to the mistaken inference which his disciples had drawn from his words. They had said, "It is not good to marry" (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-10.htm">Matthew 19:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them</span>. Something of what the Master had said concerning the marriage state affected the disciples. Had he not just (see <a href="../../par/matthew/19-10.htm">Matthew 19:10-12</a>) been claiming high honour for the solitary life where there were no family ties to claim attention? Surely, then, these women and their children had better stand aloof: what had that grave and earnest Teacher of theirs to do with these? He had higher and more important matters on his mind f 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-16.htm">Luke 18:16</a></div><div class="verse">But Jesus called them <i>unto him</i>, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God</span>. St. Mark, who gives us here the memories of a faithful eye-witness  - St. Peter - records how much displeased Jesus was when he saw them pushing back the mothers and their little ones, eager to win a smile or perhaps a touch from him whom the people justly regarded as the children's Friend. It seems also to have been the practice for Jewish mothers to bring their babes to famous rabbis, and to ask these teachers to bless their little ones. Christ's "interest in the little children was real, <span class="accented">and for their own sakes.</span> It was primary; not merely secondary, and because of the childlikeness of his subjects. <span class="accented">If they who are like little children belong to the kingdom of heaven, why should we for a moment doubt that the little children themselves belong to the kingdom</span>? Doubtless they all do. And if that change which men call <span class="accented">death</span> happen to them while they are still little children, we may rest assured that it will be to the little ones <span class="accented">bye everlasting.</span> They will not be shut out from the higher province of the kingdom of heaven when they are snatched away from the lower" (Dr. Morrison). St. Mark's account, being that of an eye-witness, is fuller and more graphic. It is read in the Office of the Church of England for the Baptism of Infarcts, wherein young children are in like manner presented to Christ. It is considered that the Master's words and act here justify the Church in commending infants, as such, to the blessing of their Father. Surely if little ones were capable of spiritual blessings then, they are so now. It is noticeable that these children were not brought to the Lord to be taught, but "that he should put his hands upon them, and bless them" (<a href="../../par/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-17.htm">Luke 18:17</a></div><div class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein</span>. Jesus here reminds men that if they hope to enter the kingdom, it must be in the spirit of children, who never think of putting forward any claim of merit or paying any price for kindness showed them. His late parable of the Pharisee and publican was evidently in the Master's mind when he said this. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-18.htm">Luke 18:18</a></div><div class="verse">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life!</span> This incident is related in the three synoptical Gospels. St. Matthew speaks of him as the young man. St. Luke here styles him a ruler; by some the title is supposed simply to denote that he was the ruler of a synagogue or congregation; others, however, consider that it denotes that the subject of the narrative was a ruler of the Jews, and possibly, but this is of course doubtful, a member of the Sanhedrin. His youth (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-20.htm">Matthew 19:20</a>) is not at variance with this inference. Youth is defined by Philo as including the period between twenty-one and twenty-eight. All the three evangelists mention his great wealth. Dean Plumptre suggests that his large possessions and evident devotion had probably opened to him, at a comparatively early age, a place in the great council. His question concerning eternal life indicates that he was a Pharisee, and he evidently represented the noblest phase of this religious party. He had sedulously followed out the precepts of the best rabbinic schools of his day, but there was something lacking, he felt, and his intercourse with Jesus and the influence of the Master's words led him to take this question point-blank to the famous Teacher, who he felt - alone of any master whom he had met - was able to satisfy this longing desire of his heart. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-19.htm">Luke 18:19</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none <i>is</i> good, save one, <i>that is</i>, God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God</span>. The title "good" was a singular one for the young ruler to have used. It was never used to the most famous rabbis by their pupils. It implied an intense reverence, but nothing more. The young man distinctly did not then believe the Master was Divine, else he had never made the great refusal recorded directly afterwards. "To be a good man is impossible...  God alone could have this honour" (Plate, 'Phaed.,' 27). "You are looking at me," said the Master, "as a man: why give me this strange, lofty title? You are looking on me only as an earthly  Teacher." The great Heart-reader was reading the young man's thoughts, thoughts which soon crystallized, as we shall see, into the <span class="accented">refused</span> to do what he, whom he chose to style "good," directed him to carry out.

There the ruler, when directed to the commandments, replies by asking "which?" expecting most likely to be referred to some of the elaborate traditional laws of the rabbinic schools, which were difficult to keep even by men in the position of a wealthy Pharisee; but to his surprise Jesus mentions the most general and best-known of the ancient ten. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-21.htm">Luke 18:21</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</span> He listens to the Master with something like impatient surprise. There is a ring of concealed indignation in his "All these have I ever kept. What do you take me for? I am a religious, God-fearing Jew; from my child-days have I kept these." Kept these! How little the poor questioner knew the secrets of his Own heart! Yet he had answered Jesus in the true spirit of a Pharisee trained carefully in the rabbinic schools. We read, for instance, in the Talmud how "when Rabbi Chaninah was dying, he said to the angel of death, 'Go and fetch me the book of the Law, and see whether there is anything in it which I have not kept.'" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-22.htm">Luke 18:22</a></div><div class="verse">Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing.</span> St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>), who had St. Peter's memories to draw from, adds here a very touching detail. "Jesus beholding him [looking earnestly at him] loved him." There was something noble and true in that life, struggling in the imperfect light of the rabbinic teaching after eternity and heaven, and feeling that in all its struggles some element was surely wanting; and Jesus, as he gazed on the young earnest face, loved him, and proceeded to show him how far removed his life was as yet from the perfect life he dreamed of attaining to. He would show him in a moment how selfish, how earthly, were his thoughts and aims; how firmly chained to earth that heart of his, which he thought only longed for heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven: and come, follow me;</span> "Well," the Master said, "I will test you. You say you have from your child-days kept your whole duty to your neighbour; you say that you hunger after the higher righteousness. Do you really? Will you indeed be perfect (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>)? Then I will tell you what you lack. Go, sell those great possessions which I know you love so dearly, and give all to the poor, and come, take up the cross (<a href="../../par/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>), and follow me, the homeless, landless Teacher whom you call by the Divine title 'good.'" The "cross" of St. Mark only Jesus understood then in all its dread significance. It was coming then very near; and the great Teacher saw that his true servants, if they would indeed follow him, must follow him along that lonely road of suffering he was then treading. "Via crucis, via lucis." The young ruler, with his great wealth, thought he had from his youth done his whole duty to his neighbour. The Galilaean Master, whom he so reverenced and admired, reminded him that out of those wide domains, those stored-up riches, out of the mammon of unrighteousness, he had forgotten to make to himself friends who, when he died, should receive him into the eternal tents of heaven. This is what he lacked, lie had probably heard the Lord's teaching in the parables of the unjust steward and of Lazarus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-23.htm">Luke 18:23</a></div><div class="verse">And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he heard this, he was</span> <span class="cmt_word">very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</span> St. Mark adds (a memory of Peter's) that when he heard this the ruler went away frowning, with a lowering look. <span class="accented">This</span> was too much. He could not, even at the bidding of that loved Teacher, give up the pleasant life he loved so well, the things he prized so highly; so silently and sadly he turned away. The 'Gospel of the Hebrews,' a very ancient document, dating from the first days of the faith, a few fragments only of which have come down to us in quotations in the Fathers, thus describes the scene: "Then the rich man began to scratch his head, for that was not to his mind. And the Lord said to him, How then canst thou say, I have kept the Law; for it is written in the Law, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; and, lo! many of thy brethren, children of Abraham, live in the gutter, and die of hunger, while thy table is loaded with good things, and nothing is sent out to them?" (quoted by Origen, in <a href="../../par/matthew/19.htm">Matthew 19</a>.). Dante calls this "The Great Refusal," and represents the shade of the young ruler among the throng of the useless, of those who faced both ways (' Inferno,' 10:27). It is worthy of notice that there was no angry retort from the wealthy ruler, no scornful, cynical smile of derision, as we read of among the covetous, wealthy Pharisees (<a href="../../par/luke/16-14.htm">Luke 16:14</a>). Still, in the heart of this seeker after the true wisdom there was a sore conflict. Grieving, sorrow-stricken, with gloomy looks, he turned away in silence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-24.htm">Luke 18:24</a></div><div class="verse">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span> The temptations which beset a rich man are so many and so various.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-25.htm">Luke 18:25</a></div><div class="verse">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom</span> <span class="cmt_word">of God.</span> This simile, taken in its plain and obvious sense, appears to many an exaggerated one, and various explanations have been suggested to soften it down. The best is found in Lord Nugent's 'Lands Classical and Sacred,' who mentions that in some modern Syrian towns the narrow gate for foot-passengers at the side of the larger gate by which waggons, camels, and other beasts of burden enter the city, is known as the "needle's eye." It is, however, very uncertain whether this term for the little gate was known in ancient times. But the simile was evidently a common one among the Jews. The Talmud, for instance, gives us the parallel phrase of an elephant passing through a needle's eye. The Koran repeats the very words of the Gospel. it is the object of the proverb to express human impossibility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I would ride the camel,<br />Yea leap him flying, through the needle's eye<br />As easily as such a pampered soul<br />Could pass the narrow gate."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Southey.</span>) It seems strange that the three evangelists, SS. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, who tell this story of the young questioner and the Master's conversation with him, do not mention his name. And yet he must have been a conspicuous personage in the society of the time. First of all, his riches were evidently remarkable. One account tells us that he was" very rich." Two of the Gospels mention his "great possessions." St. Luke tells us that he was "a ruler." He was, then, certainly a very wealthy Jew holding a high official position, not improbably a member of the Sanhedrin council. Why is he nameless in the three Gospels? Dean Plumptre has a most interesting theory that the young wealthy ruler was <span class="accented">Lazarus of Bethany.</span> He bases his hypothesis upon the following data: He begins by stating that "there is one other case in the first two Gospels which presents similar phenomena. ]n the narrative of the supper at Bethany, St. Matthew and St. Mark record the passionate affection which expressed itself in pouring the precious ointment of spikenard upon our Lord's head as the act of 'a woman' (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>), leaving her unnamed. In <a href="../../par/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a> we find that the woman was Mary, the sister of Lazarus. The train of thought thus suggested points to the supposition that here also there may have been reasons for suppressing in the records a name which was familiar to the narrator. What if the young ruler were Lazarus himself? The points of agreement are sufficiently numerous to warrant the conjecture. The household of Lazarus, as the spikenard ointment shows, were of the wealthier class. The friends who came to comfort the bereaved sisters were themselves, in St. John's language, 'of the Jews,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the chief rulers (<a href="../../par/john/11-19.htm">John 11:19</a>). The young ruler was obviously a Pharisee, and the language of Martha (<a href="../../par/john/11-24.htm">John 11:24</a>) shows that she, too, believed in eternal life and the resurrection of the dead. The answer to the young ruler, ' One thing thou lackest' (as given by St. Mark and St. Luke), is almost identical with that to Martha, 'One thing is needful' (<a href="../../par/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a>). In such a case, of course, nothing can be attained beyond conjectural inference; but the present writer must avow his belief that the coincidences in this case are such as to carry the evidence to a very high point of probability." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-26.htm">Luke 18:26</a></div><div class="verse">And they that heard <i>it</i> said, Who then can be saved?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?</span> This hard saying appeared to the disciples to be terribly comprehensive in its scope; the longing to be rich was confined to no one class or order, it was the universal passion. Were <span class="accented">theft</span> guiltless here? Were <span class="accented">they</span> not looking for riches and glory in the Messianic kingdom of the immediate future? And of all peoples the Jews in every age have been credited with the blindest devotion to this idol, wealth. In St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>) we find certainly an explanatory statement: "How hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" But this explanatory and softened statement is not found in the older authorities; these read instead, in <a href="../../par/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>, simply the words, "How hard is it to enter the kingdom of God!' Hard alike, the Master meant, for rich and poor, though harder for the former. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-27.htm">Luke 18:27</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God</span>. Yes, impossible, the Divine Teacher repeated, from a man's point of view; impossible from the platform of legal obedience on which the young ruler (ver. 21) had taken his stand, or the Pharisee in his prayer (vers. 11, 12); but it was not impossible with God. He might give this salvation as a perfectly free gift, utterly undeserved, perfectly unmerited, as he did to the <span class="accented">prodigal son</span> when he returned, or to the <span class="accented">publican</span> when he beat his breast in almost voiceless mourning, or still more conspicuously, not many days later, to the <span class="accented">penitent thief</span> dying on the cross.

Again the question  of Peter, evidently acting as spokesman of the twelve, is repeated by the first three evangelists. Strangely faithful in their accounts of their own dealings with their adored Master, they never veil or hide any human weakness or error of their own which led to an important bit of teaching from their Lord. Now, in this place, they, in the person of Peter, gave utterance to a very worldly, but a very natural, thought. The ruler had failed when the test was applied to him; he was a conspicuous example of failure in the rich to enter the kingdom. But <span class="accented">they</span> had not failed when the test had been applied to them; they had given all up for his sake: what would be their reward? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-29.htm">Luke 18:29</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting</span>. Evidently, from the reports of the three evangelists, the reply of Jesus was a lengthy one, and contained much deep teaching. St. Luke only gives us, however, one section, so to speak, of the great discourse which followed upon Peter's question. Here and in St. Mark Peter and the twelve receive a quiet rebuke in this general promise. The Master seems to say, "My promises are not especially to you, my first followers, but to all who, not for any selfish hope of recompense or reward, but for the kingdom of God's sake, give up what they hold dearest; there will be real, true happiness for them even in this world, and in the world to come unspeakable joy will be their portion; theirs will be the life that knows no ending." St. Mark adds, with rare truth, that the happiness which his faithful are to enjoy in this world will be accompanied <span class="accented">with persecutions.</span> It is the same beautiful thought which the Master had put out before, only the gem now is set in different words. "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>; see, too, vers. 11, 12), St. Matthew deals especially with another division of the Lord's discourse. Here Jesus speaks of the future of the twelve; and, looking forward to the generally noble and self-devoted lives he saw these would live, he tells them of the great destiny surely reserved for them if they remained faithful to the end. But even here, in his words, "the first shall be last" (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>), and still more pointedly in the parable of the labourers which followed (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>), he warned these devoted but often mistaken men of the danger of self-complacency. It was only because he foresaw that in these really great ones this spirit would in the end be overcome (at least in eleven of them) that he made the grand and mysterious promise of <a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>. The narrative here, in the three synoptical Gospels, is not continuous; at this point there is a break. There is little doubt but that the sickness and death of Lazarus of Bethany, and the summons of the sisters to Jesus, took place about this period. The three synoptical evangelists are silent here for reasons we have discussed elsewhere. Between vers. 30 and 31 there probably should be inserted the hasty journey to Bethany. The Master was not far when the news of his friend's death reached him. Immediately after the miracle there appears to have been a meeting of the Sanhedrin, when it was decided to put Jesus to death, though not during the ensuing Passover, with such precautions as were possible. The terrible decision became known. Jesus then retired to Ephraim, an obscure village about twenty miles from the city. Here a very short time was spent in absolute retirement and seclusion. But the Passover Feast was nigh at hand. In company with some of the crowded pilgrim caravans, and secure under their protection till his last few days of work were accomplished, Jesus journeys to Jerusalem. At this point the three synoptical Gospels take up the story again. The eleventh chapter of St. John fills up this gap in the connected story.

There was something unusual, evidently, in the manner and behaviour of the Master; silently, wrapped up in his own lofty meditations, he strode on in front of the company of his followers. A feeling of awe and fear stole over them as they watched the silent Master with the shadow of the coming cross falling, perhaps, across his countenance. Much had happened lately: the teaching growing more and more solemn as the end drew near; the raising of Lazarus; the intense enmity of the great men of the nation; the fixed determination to put the Master to death; his short retirement; then the announcement  that he was going up to face his enemies at the great feast in Jerusalem; and now alone and silent he walked at their head. What was coming? thought the twelve and their friends. He read their thoughts, and, calling them round him, told them what was about to happen. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be accomplished.</span>

The outlines of the Passion he had sketched for the disciples before on two occasions, But never so clearly as now. He even tells them the manner of his end, and how his own countrymen would give him up to the Romans, and how these Gentiles, amidst every conceivable circumstance of horror, would do him to death. And the Master closed his dread revelation by predicting his speedy resurrection.

But they listened all dazed and confused; they could not take it in, neither the shame of the death of their loved Leader, nor the glory of the Resurrection which was to follow immediately after. They could not persuade themselves that the hopes of an earthly Messianic glory in which they were to; share must positively Be given up. "We must learn to love Divine truths Before we can understand them," said Pascal. "Toward everything which is contrary to natural desire," wrote Riggenbach (in Godet), "there is produced in the heart a Blindness, which nothing but a miracle can heal." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/luke/18-35.htm">Luke 18:35</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass; that as he was come nigh unto Jericho</span>. Jericho was once called "the City of Palms," afterwards "the City of Perfumes." It was about eighteen miles from Jerusalem. In the Herodian times it became a popular resort, owing to the affection the great Herod entertained for it. Its palm-groves and balsam-gardens were a present from Antony to Cleopatra. Herod the Great bought them from her, and made it one of his royal cities, and adorned it with many stately buildings, and eventually died there, it is now a miserable village. <span class="cmt_word">A certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.</span> An apparent discrepancy exists in the three accounts given of this act of our Lord. St. Luke speaks of one blind man who was healed as our Lord was <span class="accented">entering</span> the town. St. Matthew and St. Mark mention that the miracle took place as our Lord was leaving the place, and St. Matthew mentions that two blind men received their sight at the bidding of Jesus. Several solutions of this little difficulty have been proposed. Perhaps the most probable is that the sufferers were sitting near the town gates as the <span class="accented">Lord</span> entered. They, hearing who was passing by, eagerly called to him for help. Surrounded by the crowd, he probably did not hear the cry, or possibly wished to test the earnestness of their faith by allowing them to wait. They follow him through the place, and in the open space outside the city they attract his attention, and he heals them. Or, in the words of Dr. Morrison, "the case seems to have begun as he entered into the city, but it culminated in all likelihood as he departed." A later explanation, apparently preferred by Godet and Farrar, is that, as Josephus and Eusebius distinguish between the old and the new Jericho - the old town on the ancient site, and the new Herodian town which had sprung up at a little distance from it - the blind man might, according to some traditions, have been healed as Jesus was leaving old Jericho; according to others, as he was entering the new town. The fact of SS. Mark and Luke only mentioning one blind man is easily explained. There was one evidently (as we shall suggest further on), a well-known character in Christian story - Bartimaeus. Two of the evangelists recorded his cure, as being of special interest to the Church, leaving the second among the numberless unrecorded miracles of healing of Jesus. <span class="accented">A certain blind man.</span> St. Mark names him Bartimaeus. It may be inferred that, as St. Mark specially names him, this man was well known in early Christian story. We know that after the cure he joined the company as one of the followers of Jesus.

This form of address distinctly shows that the idea that the Rabbi of Nazareth, the great Wonder-worker, the wise kind Teacher, was in some way or other the long looked-for Deliverer, was now taking possession of the people's mind. "Son of David" was distinctly a Messianic salutation.

It must be remembered that our Lord was surrounded by a great host of Passover pilgrims, by many of whom he was reverenced as "some great One," perhaps the King Messiah. Such a low wailing cry on the part of a blind beggar, asking to be brought into the presence of him they wondered at and admired and hoped so  much from, seemed a great presumption: hence these rebukes.
