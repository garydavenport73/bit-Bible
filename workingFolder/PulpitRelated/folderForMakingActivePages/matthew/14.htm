Plumptre, on Mark, adduces a curious passage from Persius, 5:180-188, which he thinks is based on a story that when Herod celebrated another of his birthdays (cf. ver. 6) in Rome, in A.D. , he was terrified by a Banquo-like appearance of the murdered prophet. The superstition that already suggested to Herod the resurrection of John might well act more strongly on the anniversary of the murder, and after he had connived at the death of the One who, by his miracles, showed that he possessed greater power than John. <span class="cmt_word">And therefore</span>; "because he is no ordinary man, but one risen from the dead" (Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">Mighty works do show forth themselves in him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) <span class="accented">do these powers work in him</span> (Revised Version).

Observe that this passage confirms the statement of <a href="../../par/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41</a>, that John performed no miracle.

Probably here in allusion to the distance of Machaerus from Herod's usual residence at Tiberius. Possibly, also, a reference to John being safer there from the designs of Herodias (<a href="../../par/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>). Anyhow, notice the stages in Herod's action - capture, binding, imprisonment in a place where he was quite out of the way. <span class="cmt_word">For Herodias' sake.</span> John was imprisoned, according to the New Testament, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a punishment for his rebuke of Herod; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to protect him from Herodias' vengeance.

Hence many critics (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ewald; Schurer, I. 2:22) suppose the account in Matthew and Mark to be mistaken, and due to a confusion of Herodias with her daughter. But, although it is curious that two sons of Herod the Great should have been called Philip, yet, in view of their being by different mothers, it cannot be pronounced impossible  ("Antipas" and "Antipater" are <span class="accented">not</span> precisely identical). Besides, Herod the son of Mariamne would probably have had some other name than that of his father alone. It is noticeable that, in the same context, Josephus speaks also of Antipas by the name Herod only.

The more detailed account in Mark is doubtless the more exact. Perhaps the facts of the case were that, in the first heat of his resentment, Herod wished to kill John, but feared the anger of the people, and that afterwards, when he him in his power and Herodias still urged his death, Herod had himself learned to respect him.

Besides, the trait mentioned by Mark (Mark 6:25), that she came back <span class="accented">with haste</span> to the king, asking for the head of the Baptist, implies that she was more than a child.

There is no very great difficulty in supposing the chief men of Galilee, etc. (Mark), to have gone as far as Machaerus to pay their respects to Herod and to partake of the feast, but whether the statement in Josephus is accurate, and how, if it be so, it is to be reconciled with the preceding statement that Machaerus belonged to Aretas, are questions not easily answered (see Schurer, I. 2:26). <span class="cmt_word">John Baptist's head in a charger;</span> <span class="accented">in a charger the head of John the Baptist</span> (Revised Version).

In <a href="../../par/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a> this might be sufficient (Luke has "righteous"); but here there is no question of coming up to a standard of moral uprightness, but rather of manifestation of power, and this is connected with Messiah. His authority over the elements leads to the homage of those who witness its exercise,  and forces from them the expression that he is the promised Representative of God on earth (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>, note).
