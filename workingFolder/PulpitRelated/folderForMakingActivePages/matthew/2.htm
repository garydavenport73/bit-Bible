The First Gospel, if taken alone  would give the impression that Joseph had had no previous connexion with Nazareth. But about the place where Joseph and Mary lived before the birth of Jesus the evangelist did not concern himself (cf ver. 23, note). <span class="cmt_word">Of Judaea</span>. For the evangelist's purpose it was most important so to define it as to exclude Bethlehem of Zebulun (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). The inhabitants of Bethlehem of Judaea, a market town of a fruitful (Ephratah) district, live chiefly by agriculture, but also for several centuries have manufactured images of saints, rosaries, and fancy articles. Since 1834: it has been almost exclusively occupied by Christians (Socin's Baedeker,' p. 243, seq.). From "the House of Bread" came forth" the true Bread." <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Herod the king</span>. Herod the Great and Herod Agrippa II. (<a href="../../par/acts/25-13.htm">Acts 25:13</a>) alone held the legal title of "king" for any time (but cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>, note) - the former as King of the Jews (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:14.4), or King "of the Idumaeans and Samaritans" (Appian, 'Civ., 5:75; <span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, 1:1. 340), by a decree of an express meeting of the Roman senate,  <span class="date">B.C. 40</span>; the latter by Claudius's appointment, as king first of Chalcis (A.D. 48-53) and afterwards (A.D. 53-100) of the tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:12. 8; 13. 2), although Herod Antipas was so spoken of by courtesy ( <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>). <span class="accented">As</span> the date of Agrippa II. is quite out of the question, we are almost compelled by this phrase alone to recognize the date of Christ's birth as falling in the lifetime of Herod the Great. Herod the Great died in the spring of A.U.C. 750, our  <span class="date">B.C. 4</span> (Schiirer, 1:1. 466), and as our Lord was born at least forty days earlier, for the purification in the temple must have taken place before Herod's massacre of the innocents, he cannot have been born later than the very beginning of  <span class="date">B.C. 4</span>, or the end of  <span class="date">B.C. 5</span>. Indeed, upon the most natural deduction from ver. 16, he must have been born some months earlier. The Church, from the days of Justin Martyr ('Ap.,' 1:32), has loved to see in the abolition by Rome of the kingdom of the Jews at the death of Herod, of its native dynasty by Herod's usurnation (Origen, 'Genesis Hom.,' 17:6), the fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold, there came Wise Men from the East</span>. The true order, as given in the Revised Version, lays the emphasis on the office, and in a subordinate degree on the home of the strangers <span class="accented">- Wise Men from the East came.</span> This translation also hints at the full meaning of the verb ( <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) , of which the connotation is not of the place a quo, but of the publicity of their appearance at the place <span class="accented">in quo</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>). <span class="accented">Wise Men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); "astromyens" (Wickliffe); "<span class="accented">rages"</span> (Rheims). On this word see especially Schrader ('Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament') on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. He considers it to be in origin not Iranian (Medo-Persian), but Babylonian, and to have primarily meant either "<span class="accented">one</span> who is deep whether in power and reputation or in insight," or one who has fulness of power. It was, perhaps, at first used with special reference to astrologers and interpreters of dreams, and, passing from Babylonia to Media, it became the name of the Median priestly order. In the latter sense it is probably used here. In <a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6-8</a> it, apparently by reversion, is used in its wider meaning. Of the number and rank of those who now came absolutely nothing is known. Of greater importance is Cicero's statement ('De Div.,' 1:41), "Nee quisquam rex Persarum potest esse, qui non ante magorum disciplinam scientiamque perceperit." These Magi <span class="accented">spontaneously</span> submit to the Babe. <span class="accented">From the East.</span> The proper home of the Magi would thus be Media, and, from the length of time employed on their journey (ver. 16), it is probable that by "the East" we must here understand Media or some other part of the kingdom, of Parthia, into which Media had been mostly absorbed, and in which, in fact, the Magi were now greatly honoured. <span class="accented">Many</span>, <span class="accented">however</span> (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebr.'; and Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:203, who points out that a Jewish kingdom of Yemen then existed), think that these Magi came from Arabia; and with this the tradition, evidently received by Justin Martyr and frequently referred to by him ( <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, 'Trypho,' &sect;&sect; 77, 78, 88, 102; cf. Reseh, 'Agrapha,' p. 471), perhaps agrees. But Justin's own opinion was that they came from Damascus, which "was and is a part of the land of Arabia" (&sect; 78). It is noticeable that Justin's tradition is confirmed by the Jerusalem Talmud ('Ber.,' 2:4), which makes an "Arabian" tell a Jew that Messiah is born. The whole passage is worth quoting for its illustration of several details in this chapter. "After this the children of Israel shall be converted, and shall inquire after the Lord their God, and David their king (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). Our rabbins say, 'That is King Messias, if he be among the living, his name is David, or if dead, David is his name.' Rabbi Tanchum said, 'Thus I prove it: He sheweth mercy to David his Messiah' (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>). Rabbi Josua ben Levi saith, 'His name is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5de;&#x5d7;</span>, a Branch (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>).' Rabbi Judah bar Aibu saith, ' His name is Menahem (that is, <span class="accented">Para>klhtov</span>, the Comforter).' And that which happened to a certain Jew, as he was ploughing, agreeth with this business. A certain Arabian travelling, and hearing the ox bellow, said to the Jew at plough,  'O Jew, loose thy oxen, and loose thy ploughs, for, behold, the temple is laid waste!' The ox bellowed the second time; the Arabian saith to him, 'O Jew, Jew, yoke thy oxen, and fit thy ploughs: for, behold, King Messiah is born!' But saith the Jew, 'What is his name?' 'Menahem,' saith he. 'And what is the name of his father?' 'Hezekiah,' saith the Arabian. To whom the Jew, 'But whence is he?' The other answered, ' From the palace of the King of Bethlehem-Judah.' Away he went, and sold his oxen, and his ploughs, and became a seller of infants' swaddling-clothes, going about from town to town. When he came to that city (Bethlehem) all the women bought of him, but the mother of Menahem bought nothing. He heard the voice of the women saying, 'O thou mother of Menahem, thou mother of Menahem, carry thy son the things that are here sold.' But she replied, 'May the enemies of Israel be strandded, because on the day that he was born the temple was laid waste.' To whom he said, 'But we hoped, that as it was laid waste at his feet, so at his feet it would be built again.' She saith, 'I have no money.' To whom he replied, 'But why should this be prejudicial to him? Carry him what you buy here, and if you have no money to-day, after some days I will come back and receive it.' After some days he returns to that city, and saith to her, 'How does the little infant?' And she said, 'From the time you saw me last, spirits [winds] and tempests came, and snatched him away out of my hands.' Rabbi Bon saith, 'What need have we to learn from an Arabian? Is it not plainly written, "And Lebanon shall fall before the Powerful One?" (Esa. 10:34). And what follows after? "A Branch shall come out of the root of Jesse" (Esa. 11:1)'" ('Hor. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) . To Jerusalem. The capital, where this King would reign, and where information about his birth would most naturally be obtained.

In the way of their ordinary pursuits they learned of Christ. The observation of nature led them to nature's Bond (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). What this star really was has been the subject of much consideration without any very satisfactory result. The principal theories are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, which took place in May to July and again in September,  <span class="date">B.C. 7</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It was the rising of Sirius on the same day in the fifth, fourth, third, and second years B.C. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It was some strange evanescent star such as Kepler saw in 1603-4. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Astronomy can suggest nothing which satisfies all the conditions, and the appearance must have been strictly miraculous. Since Professor Pritchard's article in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' this last has been generally accepted in England. A further question is - How came they to identify the star as "his"? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What made the Magi connect the coming of the King of the Jews with a star? and what made them consider that this particular appearance was the one they expected? The latter part of the question can hardly be answered, except on the supposition that the star that they saw was in itself so extraordinary as to convince them that no greater star could be looked for. To the former part various answers have been given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Balaam's prophecy (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>) was understood literally, and the knowledge of it, with its misinterpretation, had spread to the Magi. For this literal interpretation, cf. the 'Pesikta Zutarta' ('Lekah Tob') on <a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a> (p. 58, Venice edit.), where it says that in the fifth year of the heptad before Messiah "the star" shall shine forth from the east,, and this is the star of the Messiah (cf. also Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:212). Similarly we find  the false Messiah of the second century applying the term to himself - "Barcochab." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They had learned, by intercourse with Jews (cf. the influence of the Jewish Sibylline oracles on the fourth eclogue), that these latter expected a great King, and they had applied to his coming, as to all events, the science that they themselves practised. They believed fully in astrology, and the Divine ordering that a star should appear to them was a condescension to the then state of human knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">In the East</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>). Ellicott points out ('Hist. Lects.,' p. 73) that to translate this "at its rising" seems to be at needless variance with the use of the same words in ver. 9, where they seem to stand in a kind of <span class="accented">local</span> antithesis to "where the young Child was." For the phrase as referring to the Eastern part of the earth, cf. Clem. Romans, &sect; 5. It is more definite than the plural of ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">And are come</span>.

Fully in accordance with his jealous and suspicious character. For he had already slain, as actual or possible candidates for the throne, five of the Maccabean princes and princesses, including his favourite wife Mariamne (thus extirpating the direct line) and also his two sons by Mariamne. Josephus ('Ant.,' 17:02. 4; cf. Holtzmann) mentions a prediction of the Pharisees towards the end of Herod's life, that "God had decreed that Herod's government should cease, and his posterity should be deprived of it." This seems to have a Messianic reference, though used at the time for an intrigue in favour of Pheroras, Herod's brother. <span class="cmt_word">And all Jerusalem</span>. The feminine (here only, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) points to a Hebrew source. The reason for the inhabitants of Jerusalem feeling troubled is generally explained, by their fear, which was in fact only too well justified by experience, that the news would excite Herod to fresh crimes. It is also possible that many would shrink from the changes which the coming of Messiah could not but bring. Present ease, though only comparative, is with the unbelieving preferable to possibilities of the highest blessedness. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a> affords both a parallel and a contrast. <span class="cmt_word">With him</span>.

The addition helped to bring out the evangelist's thought that the representatives of the chosen people (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>) were fully informed of the coming of Christ. The chief priests (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>, note) represented the ecclesiastical and Sadducean part, the scribes the more literary and probably the Pharisaic part, of the nation.

Observe, in Herod's inquiry and subsequent action, the combination of superstition and irreligion.

This may be due <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> to a different pointing of the Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (cf. the rabbinic commentary, 'Metzud.

This is a paraphrase, with a paraphrastic addition from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a> (7:7), in order to distinctly identify the ruler with Messiah. Nothing is commoner in Jewish authors than the silent conjunction of quotations from separate contexts. In this case the thought of the shepherd in <a href="../../par/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> made the addition from Samuel the more easy. It must also be noticed that the reference of the passage in Micah to Christ is fully borne out by Jewish writers. Though they generally explain the rest of the verse as referring to the long lapse of time from David himself, they understand the ruler to be Messiah. But it is not usual with Jewish interpreters to understand the reference to Bethlehem as implying the place of Messiah's own birth. They generally take it as referring to the home of David, Messiah's ancestor. And this is the more natural meaning of the prophecy. The quotation, however, from the Jerusalem Talmud already given on ver. 1, and the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="../../par/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a> ("the tower of Edar - the place whence King Messiah is about to be revealed in the end of the days"), endorse the thoroughly Jewish character of the reply given to Herod (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). If it be asked why St. Matthew does not give an exact and verbal rendering of the Hebrew, the answer may be made that he probably gives the current form of its exposition. The high priests and scribes would have doubtless quoted it accurately <span class="accented">in the process</span> of weighing Micah's statement, but when, as here, they were only reproducing the result that they had arrived at, they would care for only the substance of the prophet's teaching (cf. the paraphrastic rendering of the Targum). <span class="accented">In the land of Judah</span>; Revised Version omits <span class="accented">in</span> ( <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>). "Bethlehem-Judah" would have presented no difficulty, for a town was often distinguished by the apposition of the name of the district in which it was situated; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ramoth-Gilead, Kedesh-Naphtali. It seems best to explain the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> as a mere expansion of "Judah" (cf. 1 Macc. 5:68, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, where probably the thought was Ashdod-Philistia). It is, however, possible that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> is here used in the sense of "the town and its surrounding district, over which district, it is to be observed, Herod extended his massacre (verse 16)" (Humphrey, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.).

Secrecy was doubly necessary. He would not publicly commit himself to acknowledging the rights of the new King, and he would give no opportunity for others to warn the Child's parents of the dangerous interest that Herod was taking in him. Duplicity was very characteristic of Herod; cf. his assassination of Aristobulus the high priest (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 15:03. 3), and his alluring his son Antipater home to death (ibid., 17:5. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Inquired of them diligently</span>; <span class="accented">learned of them carefully</span> (Revised Version); "lerned of hem bisili" (Wickliffe); <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The stress is not upon Herod's careful questioning, but on the exact information that he obtained. <span class="cmt_word">What time the star appeared</span>.

Herod supposed that the birth of the Babe was synchronous with the first appearance of the star. The translation, however, of the Revised Version margin, "the time of the star that appeared," better suits the exact wording ( <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>;<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the phrase thus including both the first appearance and also the period of continuance (cf. Grotius, "non initium, sed continuitas"). But it is difficult to see What Herod would have learned from this latter particular. Some even think that the star was still visible (Plumptre; Weiss, 'Matthew'), but in this case the joy of the Magi in ver. 10 is not satisfactorily explained.

The road to Bethlehem is, and from the nature of the valley must always have been, so nearly straight (until the last half-mile, when there is a sudden turn up the hill) that the star need have moved but slightly.

St. Matthew may hays held that Messiah was the Flower of Israel, so that what was predicated of Israel could be essentially explained of Messiah; he may have considered that Messiah was so organically connected with Israel that even when the nation was in Egypt Messiah was there also (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-10.htm">Hebrews 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>); he may have thought that the pro-incarnate Son of God was always with his Church, and therefore with it even in Egypt; but of none of these theories have we any hint. The application of <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a> to the early life of Christ belongs, we do not doubt, to the very earliest stage of Jewish Christian thought, and to defend it by modern subtleties of interpretation (sound though they may be in other connexions) seems quite out of place. Messiah was in some sense, as all Jews granted, the Son of God; Messiah, like the nation, went down into Egypt; what was predicated of the one was, clearly in this case, true of the other, and the prophet's words received a "fulfilment." The fulfilment was, indeed, what we should call a coincidence (cf. ver. 23, note), but to the pious mind, and especially to the pious mind of a Jew, coincidences are not chances, they are signs of the Divine Governor (cf. Bishop Westcott, 'Hebr.,' p. 481: 1889).

Although Macrobius is a late writer [circ. 400]. and made the mistake of supposing that Herod's son Antipater, who was put to death about the same time as the massacre of the innocents, had actually perished in that massacre, it is clear that the form in which he narrates the <span class="accented">bon</span> <span class="accented">mot</span> of Augustus points to some dim reminiscence of this cruel slaughter" (Farrar, 'Life,' etc., p. 34, illust. edit.; cf. also Ellicott, 'Lectures,' p. 78).

St. Matthew applies Jeremiah's picture of Rachel, the mother of Joseph, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Ephraim (and also Manasseh), which was the typical part of the northern kingdom, weeping over the destruction of her children by the Assyrians, to the weeping of the mothers in Bethlehem. This application was the more easy because, as Rachel's tomb was near Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>.7), she might be considered the figurative ancestress of the Bethlehe-mites as well as the physical ancestress of the Ephraimites. The fulfilment spoken of is thus not to be understood as implying that Jeremiah predicted the massacre at Bethlehem, but that in it his words received a new and deeper significance. It must, however, be added that, although Rachel's tomb is placed at Bethlehem, both by the direct statement of the present text of Genesis and by tradition, which may be traced at least as far back as A.D. , and is accepted by Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, there are serious doubts whether <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a> does not definitely place it in the north of Benjamin, and whether <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> does not accept this latter view (cf. for this question Delitzsch, on Genesis, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) .

But after Antipater's death Herod altered his will; and appointing Antipas Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, and Philip Tetrarch of Gaulonitis, Traehonitis, and Paneas, he granted the kingdom to Archelaus. Further, even after Herod's death, the succession was far from certain until the consent of Augustus had been obtained, and this, in fact, was jeopardized by Archelaus's massacre of three thousand cf those who, on his accession, called for justice on the agents of the barbarities of the late reign. Eventually, however, Herod's last arrangement was practically confirmed by Augustus, save that he expressly gave Archelaus, who had hastened to Rome, but half of his father's dominion, and appointed him only ethnarch, promising to make him king "if he governed that part virtuously" (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 17:08. 1; 11. 4; cf. 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:33. 8; 2:7. 3).  Joseph's fear of Archelaus quite corresponds to the character given of him by the Jewish ambassadors before Augustus.

What this term is may be gathered from the true text of Talm. Bab., 'Sanh.,' 43a (cf. 'Levy,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>, and for the passage in full, Rabbinowicz, 'Var.

Of Netzer it is said, "They brought Netzer up for trial. He said to the judges, Shall Netzer be slain? It is written, 'A branch (<span class="accented">netzer</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>)  out of his roots shall bear fruit (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>).'They answered him, Yea, Netzer shall be slain. For it is written, 'But thou art cast forth away from thy sepulchre like an abominable branch'" (<span class="accented">netzer</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>). It does not now concern us to inquire which, if any, of the twelve disciples is here spoken of by the name of Netzer. But it is evident that  the Jews <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> connected this name closely with Jesus the Nazarene just before mentioned, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> saw a connexion between it and "the Branch" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. True that they rejected the disciple's application of the passage, but they did not reject the identity of the expressions. The application which was made, even according to the Talmud, is fully expressed by the evangelist here. There, as we may see if we read between the lines, the disciple claimed for his Christianity that it corresponded to the promise of Isaiah; here the evangelist more definitely claims a correspondence between that promise and Jesus. He is not concerned with deeper points of similarity, though they could not fail to suggest themselves both to him and to his readers, but merely notices that the very dwelling-place of Jesus answers to the promise of Messiah. <span class="accented">Netzer</span> he was to be; the Divine working brought it about that this, though in adjectival form, was his common appellation.

Why Joseph settled at Nazareth rather than at any other spot in Galilee, St. Matthew gives no hint. The reason is found in the fact recorded by St. Luke that Mary (<a href="../../par/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>) and Joseph (<a href="../../par/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>) had lived there before the Birth. It is true that St. Matthew's account taken alone gives the impression that this was not the case, but the impression is not so strong as to warrant even the assertion that St. Matthew was ignorant of the earlier residence, much less that his account in fact contradicts St. Luke's. The mutual independence and the general trustworthiness of the two accounts of the Birth and Infancy is shown by the fact that in their less important details they cannot always be reconciled.
