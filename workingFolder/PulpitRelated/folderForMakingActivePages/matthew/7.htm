Censoriousness - the personal danger of having it (vers. 1, 2), its seriousness as a sign of ignorance and as a hindrance to spiritual vision (vers. 3-5), even though there must be a recognition of great moral differences (ver. 6). Grace to overcome it and to exercise judgment rightly can be obtained by prayer (vers. 7-11), the  secret of overcoming being found in treating others as one would like to be treated one's self (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/6-37.htm">Luke 6:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Judge not</span>. Not merely "do not condemn," for this would leave too much latitude; nor, on the other hand, "do not ever judge," for this is sometimes our duty; but "do not be always judging" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). Our Lord opposes the censorious spirit. "Let us therefore be lowly minded, brethren, laying aside all arrogance, and conceit, and folly, and anger, and let us do that which is written...  most of all remembering the words of the Lord Jesus which he spake, teaching forbearance and brag-suffering; for thus he spake...  'As ye judge, so shall ye be judged,'" Clem. Romans, &sect; 13 (where see Bishop Lightfoot's note; el. also Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 96, 136 ft.); cf. 'Ab.,' 1:7 (Taylor), "Judge every man in the scale of merit;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let the scale incline towards the side of merit or acquittal. <span class="cmt_word">That ye be not judged</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by God, with special reference to the last day (cf. <a href="../../par/james/2-12.htm">James 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-9.htm">James 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>). Hardly of judgment by men, as Barrow (serm. 20.): "Men take it for allowable to retaliate in this way to the height, and stoutly to load the censorious man with censure."

In both clauses (cf. ver. 1, note) the passives refer to judgment by God, as is even more clear in <a href="../../par/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24</a>. The saying, "with what measure," etc., is found in Mishua, 'Sotah,' 1:7 ("With the measure with which a man measures do they measure to him"), where it is applied to the <span class="accented">jus talionis</span> in the case of a woman suspected of adultery (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-11.htm">Numbers 5:11-31</a>). <span class="accented">Again.</span> Omitted by the Revised Version, with the manuscripts.

A Jewish proverbial saying, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Talm. Bab., 'Bab. Bathra,' 15b, Rabbi Jochanan ( <span class="date">third century A.D.</span>),expounding <a href="../../par/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>, says, "A generation which when under judgment (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5e4;&#x5d8;</span>) judgeth its judges. When one saith to a man, Cast out the mote out of thine eyes, he saith (in answer), Cast out the beam out of thine eyes." In Talm. Bab., 'Erach.,' 16<span class="accented">b</span>, "Out of thy teeth" seems to be the right reading. In these verses the "eye" is usually taken as belonging solely to the illustration, and as not itself representing any one object. It may be so, but it has been used so recently (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>) of the spiritual sense that it is more natural to take it so here. In this case the thought of the passage is of faults existing in a man's spiritual sense hindering his spiritual vision. The censorious man sees any fault, however small, readily enough in others, but does not see the much greater fault which he himself as a matter of fact has - his own censoriousness. This censoriousness is not a slight, but a great hindrance to his own spiritual vision, much more to his being of use in removing hindrances from the eye of another. <span class="accented">The mote</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Latt. <span class="accented">festucam</span>; any small vegetable body. The English word is from the Anglo-Saxon <span class="accented">mot</span>, "a small particle" (cf. further <a href="../../par/luke/6-41.htm">Luke 6:41</a>, note). Observe that our Lord allows that there is something wrong with the brother's spiritual vision, just as he allows that the unmerciful servant had a real debt owing to him. <span class="cmt_word">That is in thy brother's eye</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, note). Our Lord is here speaking of the relation of believers to fellow-believers. He tacitly contrasts the censoriousness of the Pharisees towards fellow-Jews (<a href="../../par/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But considerest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). With any attention of mind; contrast <a href="../../par/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a> (Abraham gave earnest consideration to his own age, and yet believed). <span class="cmt_word">The beam</span>. So huge a piece of wood is there in thine own eye. <span class="cmt_word">That is in thine own eye</span>. The order of the Greek lays still more emphasis on the fact that, though in thy very own eye there is a beam, thou payest no regard to that (cf. ver. 5, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/7-4.htm">Matthew 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam <i>is</i> in thine own eye?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/6-42.htm">Luke 6:42</a><span class="accented">a</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Or</span>.

There is nothing here of the rudeness that so often accompanies censeriousness. <span class="accented">Pull out</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">cast out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>). The thought is of the completeness, not the method, of the removal (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-38.htm">Matthew 9:38</a>). A beam; <span class="accented">the beam</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beam already mentioned.

First cast out <span class="cmt_word">the beam out of thine own eye,</span> In ver. 3 the order of the words lays the emphasis on "thine;" here, on the eye. It is in thine eye, of all places, that the beam now is. <span class="cmt_word">And then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye</span>. Surely a promise as well as a statement. <span class="accented">See clearly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>- discriminatingly); as in the right text of <a href="../../par/mark/8-25.htm">Mark 8:25</a>, itself after the recovery of full power of sight. <span class="accented">See clearly.</span> Not the mote (ver. 3), but to cast out the mote. The verse seems to imply that if the spirit of censoriousness be absent, it will be possible for us to remove "motes" from the eyes of our brothers. Thus the passage as a whole does not say that we never ought to try to remove such "motes," but that this is monstrous and almost impossible so long as we ourselves have a fault of so much magnitude as censoriousness.

You must not treat those who are mere dogs and swine as if they were able to appreciate either the holiness or the beauty and wealth of spiritual truth. <span class="accented">Give</span> Observe that "give," "cast," are naturally used of feeding dogs and swine respectively. <span class="accented">That which is holy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

In rage at the disappointment experienced. The clause expresses the personal enmity which those who wilfully reject the gospel often feel towards those that have offered it to them. It might be thought difficult to carry out this command, as it is evident that we cannot know beforehand who will accept the gospel or not. But in cases where the character of the person is not known (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> as when St. Paul preached at Athens, etc.), the command does not apply. Our Lord <span class="accented">supposes</span> the case where the character is apparent (cf. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-24.htm">1 Timothy 5:24</a>). Theodoret (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 103, 168), in quoting this verse, adds, "My mysteries are tot me and mine," which, clearly an adaptation of Symmachus and Theodotion's rendering of <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> (cf. also Targ.

Nearly verbally identical, but in the son's request, reads "<span class="accented">egg"</span> and "<span class="accented">scorpion"</span> for "bread" and "stone," and reverses the order of the sentences. In Luke the verses are closely connected ("and I say unto you") with the parable of the friend at midnight, which itself immediately follows the Lord's Prayer. It seems probable that, as with the Lord's Prayer (ch. 6:9-13, note), so with these verses, the original position is given in Luke; yet, as also with the Lord's Prayer, Matthew's form of the individual clauses may be the more original (cf. ver. 11, note).

Not "these things" do ye to them; for our Lord carefully avoids any expression that might lead to a legal enumeration of different details, but "thus" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), referring to the character of your own wishes. (For this "golden rule," cf. Tobit 4:15 (negative form); cf. also patristic references in Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 95, 135.) On the occasional similarity of pre-Christian writings to the teaching of our Lord, Augustine (<span class="accented">vide</span> Trench, 'Serm.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) well says it is "the glory of the written and spoken law, that it is the transcript of that which was from the first, and not merely as old as this man or that, but as the Creation itself, a reproduction of that obscured and forgotten law written at the beginning by the finger of God on the hearts of all men. When, therefore, heathen sages or poets proclaimed any part of this, they had not thereby anticipated Christ; they had only deciphered some fragment of that law, which he gave from the first, and which, when men, exiles and fugitives from themselves and from the knowledge of their own hearts, had lost the power of reading, he came in the flesh to read to them anew, and to bring out the well-nigh obliterated  characters afresh." (Compare also Bishop Lightfoot's essay on "St. Paul and Seneca," in his 'Philippians.') <span class="cmt_word">For this is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="accented">For this<span class="cmt_word">.</span> </span>This principle of action and mode of life is, in fact, the sum of all Bible teaching (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).

On the other hand, our ver. 14 seems so direct an answer to <a href="../../par/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a> that it is not unlikely that this is one of the many passages placed by St. Matthew, or the authors of his sources, out of chronological order.

But in this case the revelation (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>, note) of Christ was merely the instrument by which these men proclaimed Divine truths, cast out; demons, and wrought miracles. With him, or even with it, they had no real union. The connexion of "prophesied" with the two other words seems to forbid this being only false prophesying (ver. 15; cf. especially <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-15.htm">Jeremiah 27:15</a> [34:12, LXX.]; 14:14). Rather does the verse teach that spiritual results can be effected by unspiritual men. "Suggested by this and like passages. Augustine has many instructive words and warnings on the nothingness of all gifts, even up to the greatest gift of working nil miracles, if charity be wanting" (Trench, ' Sermon on the Mount'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a></div><div class="verse">And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/luke/13-27.htm">Luke 13:27</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And then will I profess unto them</span>. Openly in the face of all men (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I never knew you</span>. Even when you did all these miracles. etc., I had not that personal knowledge of you which is only the result of heart-sympathy. There was never anything in common between you and me. Although this is, perhaps, the only example of this sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the synoptic Gospels, it is common in John. <span class="cmt_word">Depart from me</span>. The absence of recognition by Christ, though not represented as the cause, yet will involve departure from his presence (cf. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). This clause reproduces verbally the LXX. of <a href="../../par/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a>, except in St. Matthew's word used for "depart" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), which gives more idea of distance in the removal than the word used in the psalm and in Luke (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye that work</span>.

Iniquity. The assurance of the psalmist becomes the verdict of the Judge. Observe that at this, the end of his discourse, our Lord speaks not of  sin generally (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), but of lawlessness (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). He has throughout been insisting upon obedience to the Law in its final meaning as essentially necessary for his followers (most recently ver. 12). So that instead of saying, "ye that work sin," he uses the correlative (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>), for sin is neglect of or opposition to the perfect Law of God in the three spheres that this regards - self, the world, God (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>). It is, perhaps, more than a coincidence that in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a> we have again the collocation of the Lord knowing and of man's <span class="accented">departing</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either from him or from sin (cf. especially the parallel <a href="../../par/luke/13-27.htm">Luke 13:27</a>); <span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 207. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-27.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47-49</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10-16</a>). A solemn close to the sermon. By the similitude of two builders our Lord warns his followers that to have heard his words will have been useless unless they put them into practice. Observe that although the word "<span class="accented">hear</span> in these verses cannot indicate that full "<span class="accented">hearing"</span> which it sometimes connotes (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>), yet it seems to mean more than merely listening, and to imply both a grasp of what is intended by the statements made and at least some acquiescence in their truth (<a href="../../par/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). According to the above explanation, it will be seen that in the imagery the rock represents practice; the sand, mere sentiment. There is thus a partial correspondence with the works insisted on by St. James in contrast to a bare orthodox faith (<a href="../../par/james/2-24.htm">James 2:24</a>). Assent is insufficient; there must be action. Not uncommonly, indeed, the rock is considered to refer to the Lord himself, and the sand to human effort. Cf. Ford: "The parallel passage (<a href="../../par/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>), where the words, 'cometh unto Me,' are inserted, indicates clearly the foundation of <span class="accented">faith</span>, the receiving the Lord Jesus as our Prophet, Priest, and King, which is the only basis on which <span class="accented">good</span> works can be built" (cf. even Allord). This, however, is hardly exegesis, but application, for the "coming to Christ" is in Luke only introductory to the hearing and doing, and is altogether omitted here. Although the statement is true in itself, it is only so far proper to this passage in that, apart from practice, there is (ver. 23) no heart-union with Christ. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - Therefore whosoever hoareth; Revised Version, <span class="accented">every one therefore which heareth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> , <a href="../../par/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>). The relative used lays <span class="accented">stress</span> on the quality implied in the verb: every one who is of the kind that <span class="accented">hears</span> (contrast ver. 26). <span class="cmt_word">These sayings</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">words</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>mine, and doeth them</span>.

Not shall, in fact, be made like, ch. 6:8 (Weiss), but shall be likened in figure and parable. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a wise man</span>. Prudent, sensible (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Which built his house upon a rock</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the rock.</span> Which in not a few <span class="accented">cases</span> may be found at no great distance from the surface.

In the Plain of Sharon the clay seems to have been so interior that not only were the jars made of it often worthless, but the bricks could offer so little resistance to the weather that the houses were hardly safe. Hence a special prayer was offered by the high priest on the Day of Atonement that the Lord would grant that their houses might not become their tombs (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Yoma,' 5:2 [Schwab, p. 218]; cf. Neubauer, 'Geograph.,' p. 48). In the parable, however, it is not the structure, but the foundation, that is wrong. <span class="accented">The sand</span> may refer, as Stanley suggests ('Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 13. p. 430), to one locality, in which case it is probably "the long sandy strip of land which bounds the eastern plain of Acre, and through which the Kishon flows into the sea;" or, as would seem more probable, to the sand which would naturally be found on the edges of such a torrent as is here described. <span class="accented">Beat upon</span>; <span class="accented">smote upon</span> (Revised Version). In ver. 25 the thought is more of the swoop of the tempest (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); here, of its impact on the house (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). It is possible that there is here less indication of force necessary for the destruction. "It needed  only the first blow, and the house fell" (Weiss, 'Matthaus-ev.'). <span class="accented">And great was the fall of it.</span> Our Lord's solemn verdict of the utter ruin awaiting him who does not put his assent into action. The clause conveys an impression even stronger than ver. 23. There the positive worker of lawlessness is banished from Christ's presence; here, on the mere non-worker of Divine messages received is pronounced ruin and (for such, at least, seems suggested) that irremediable.
