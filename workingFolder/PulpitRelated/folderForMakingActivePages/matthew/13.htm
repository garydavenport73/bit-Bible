This is not the case here, so that we must assume that a literal day is intended. But which day? Naturally, the day that has just before been mentioned, either in the original source from which our narrative is taken or in the narrative as it now stands. Since, however, <a href="../../par/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a> and our vers. 1-23 appear to have been already connected in the framework (as is seen from their being in the same relative position in Mark), these supposed alternatives really represent the same thing, the phrase probably referring to the day on which our Lord's mother and brethren sought to speak to him (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went Jesus out of the house.</span> Where he had been when his mother came (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46</a>, note), and presumably the one to which he returned in ver. 36.

Further, the tense (pluperf., equivalent to imperf.) pictures them as patiently standing there. <span class="cmt_word">On the shore;</span> <span class="accented">beach</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this part at least of the shore was covered with sand or pebbles.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake many things.</span> Of which but a few are here recorded (cf. vers. 34, 51). <span class="cmt_word">Unto them in parables.</span> Taking the expression in the widest sense, "speaking in parables" began in the very earliest ages, when natural or spiritual truths were described under figures taken from everyday life, and continues until the present  time, more especially among Eastern nations. Interesting examples of such a method of instruction are to be seen in the Haggadoth (which are frequently parabolic narratives) of the Talmuds and other Jewish works. But both myth (cf. Alford) and parabolic Haggada share the common danger of being misunderstood as narratives which are intended to be taken literally, while in the parable, in the narrower sense of the word, such a confusion is hardly possible. For the narrative then suggests, either by its introduction or its structure, that it is only the mirror by which a truth can be seen, and is not the truth itself. Such parables also, though seldom even approaching in beauty to our Lord's, are very frequent in Jewish writings, though they come but seldom in the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23-29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35-40</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1-10</a>, which are rather allegories; and <a href="../../par/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-15</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>, which are fables). (On the distinction of parable in the narrower sense from fable, myth, proverb, allegory, see Alford and Trench.) Weiss ('Life,' 2:115) thinks that the most profound reason of all which the Lord had for employing parables was that he wished to show that the same regulations which hold good for the world round us and ourselves in relation to the world and each other, hold good also in the higher ethical and religious life. But at the most this can have been a very subsidiary motive with him. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Behold, a sower.</span> Observe that our Lord enters upon his parable at once (contrast ver. 24). He will attract attention. Mark's "Hear ye" would have forwarded this. <span class="accented">A sower</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the sower</span>, as the Revised Version; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sower of whom I am about to speak (cf.

Thus in meaning, though not in form, as compared with the next verse, <span class="accented">seeing</span> is equivalent to "seeing ye shall see;" <span class="accented">they see not</span>, to "and shall in no wise perceive;" <span class="accented">hearing</span>, to "hearing ye shall hear;" <span class="accented">they hear not</span>, to "and shall in no wise understand."

The verses stand there, that is to say, in close connexion with the other great utterance contrasting God's revelation of spiritual things to some and his hiding them from others. Possibly he spoke the verses only once (cf. the repetitions in the Prophets), but, in view of the frequency with which Christ's utterances are placed out of their original connexion, the assumption should be the other way. If he really only spoke them once, we cannot be sure which the occasion was, but the possibility that they do not properly belong here is increased by the doubt whether also ver. 12 was originally spoken now. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But blessed</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">are your eyes</span>.

The parable of the sower dealt with the first reception of the gospel; this deals with the after-development. The aim of this parable is to prevent over-sanguine expectations as to the purity of the society of believers, and to hinder rash attempts to purify it by merely external processes. Archbishop Benson ('Dict. of Christian Biogr.,' 1:745) calls attention to the fact that the first extant exposition of this parable is in Cyprian's successful appeal to the Novatianists not to separate from the Church (Ep. 54.). The aim of the somewhat similar parable in <a href="../../par/mark/4-26.htm">Mark 4:26-29</a> is to show the slowness and gradualness of the growth of the kingdom of heaven, and also the certainty of its consummation. So many words and phrases in the two parables are identical, that the possibility of one being derived from the other, either by omission or addition, must be acknowledged, but the definiteness of the aim in each points rather to their being originally two distinct parables. The divisions of the parable are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The fact of tares being present as well as good seed, and its cause (vers. 24-28<span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Although there is the natural desire to gather out the tares at once, yet, on account of the impossibility of doing so without destroying some of the good seed, this must not be attempted.

The central thought of the parable is the growth of the kingdom of heaven considered externally. Although it has small beginnings, it is to have a marvellous expansion, so that even those who naturally are outside it are glad to avail themselves of its protection. Observe that we have no right to limit its growth either to the reputation of its principles alone or to the power of its organization; both are included. Regarded as a prophecy, the parable is partially fulfilled every time that a heathen  nation places itself under the protection of a Christian nation, and more truly fulfilled whenever a nation accepts Christianity as its own religion. It is parodied when a nation or a collection of nations submits its political freedom to the dictates of claimants to spiritual superiority, whether these claim to have received such superiority as an inheritance from the past, or to have acquired it in the present. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Another parable put he forth unto them</span> (ver. 24, note), <span class="cmt_word">saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto</span> (ver. 24, note; also <a href="../../par/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">a grain of mustard seed.</span> "The Common Mustard of Palestine is <span class="accented">Sinapis nigra</span>, of the order <span class="accented">Cruciferae</span>, the Black Mustard, which is found abundantly in a wild state, and is also cultivated in the gardens for its seed.

Bab., 'Berach.,' 17<span class="accented">a</span>, it is used as a figure of the "evil impulse" within us. Hence some have interpreted it in a similar sense here, and have understood our Lord to be referring to the spread of worldliness in the Church (especially after the conversion of Constantine); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this is opposed to the <span class="accented">prima facie</span> meaning; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is unreasonable to insist that a symbol must always have the same connotation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is opposed to the idea of deliberate purpose underlying the action of the woman; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the closing words would cast too awful a shadow - they would mean that Christianity fails. <span class="cmt_word">Which a woman took</span> (ver. 31, note), <span class="cmt_word">and hid</span>. The woman probably belongs entirely to the framework of the parable (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4, 8</a>). For the work described is always, in normal societies, performed by women. Of other interpretations that which sees in her the Church as the agent by whom the kingdom of God is wrought into the world is the best. <span class="cmt_word">In three measures of meal;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an ephah.

While our Lord thus promises that the permeating influence of the kingdom of heaven shall at last be entirely successful, it is unfair to so press the parable as to deduce from it that the world as such will continue to be gradually and continuously improved up to the Lord's return. It may be so (contrast, however, <a href="../../par/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a>), but even direct prophecy, and still more parable, frequently regards the ultimate result, and passes over the intermediate stages.

The same general idea underlies our present verses, but although each evangelist appears to have used the same words as a basis, he has worked them out in his own characteristic way. For while both writers contrast our Lord's treatment of the multitudes and his treatment of the disciples in the matter of parables, St. Mark barely alludes to his using them as a judicial punishment upon the people, and St. Matthew merely hints here at the fact that Christ explained them to his disciples (see further, ver. 35<span class="accented">b</span>, note). It will be noticed that our verses have much in common with the thought of ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> It seems just possible that both paragraphs had one common nucleus from which they were each developed.

Dr. Herr ('Appendix') writes, "It is difficult not to think <span class="greek">&#x1f28;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> genuine. There was a strong temptation to omit it (cf. 27:9; Mc. Mark 1:2); and, though its insertion might be accounted for by an impulse to supply the name of the best known prophet, the evidence of the actual operation of such an impulse is much more trifling than might have been anticipated .... The erroneous introduction of Isaiah's name is limited to two passages, and in each case to a single Latin manuscript." If it be genuine, it is a parallel case to the reading "Jeremiah" instead of "Zechariah" in <a href="../../par/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a>, for which no satisfactory explanation has yet been suggested. A simple error of memory (cf. Alford) on the part of one who shows himself so well acquainted with Hebrew customs and modes of thought as our evangelist does, is perhaps the most improbable of all solutions. Possibly, just as there were summaries of legal maxims current in our Lord's time (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a>, note), so there were in Hebrew-Christian circles well known sets of quotations from the Old Testament, which were not expressly divided one from another (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-18</a>), and which were ferreted <span class="accented">to under the name of the author of the best known passage.</span> (Observe that this would distinguish these summaries from liturgical quotations.) Thus Zechariah's mention of the potter (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-13.htm">Zechariah 11:13</a>) was placed in connexion with Jeremiah's visit to the potter's house, and with his warning of the possible rejection of Israel (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>; cf. 19:1-11); cf. further Pusey's remarks on the passage in Zechariah, and <a href="../../par/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> (or perhaps 1-3), where Israel is bid listen to the lessons derived from their ancestors' behaviour, with the warning in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a> (cf. our vers. 34, 35 with ver. 14). We have an example of a similar connexion of passages in <a href="../../par/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2, 3</a>, where <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> is closely joined to <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. Observe that if St. Mark had copied his source (<span class="accented">ex hypothesi</span>) to the end of the quotation from Malachi, and for some reason omitted the next quotation, he might very easily have still retained the name "Isaiah" with which he introduces his double quotation. Had he done so, we should have had another parallel to our present verse and <a href="../../par/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a>. <span class="accented">The prophet.</span> If "Isaiah" be not genuine, this refers to "Asaph the seer" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>), who was the recognized author of the psalm.

"Asaph...  here recounts to the people their history from that Egyptaeo-Sinaitic age of yore to which Israel's national indepen dence and specific position in relation to the rest of the world goes back He will set forth the history of the fathers after the manner of a parable and riddle, so that it may become as a parable, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a didactic history, and its events as marks of interrogation and nota benes to the present age" (Delitzsch). What, however, is the exact connexion of thought in the gospel between the passage as it stands, and its context? The first clause evidently corresponds in meaning to ver. 34; Christ fulfils in a fresh sense the expression of the psalmist by speaking in parables (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). But the second clause brings in a different thought, not found, save very indirectly, in ver. 34, namely, that Christ utters things that be fore were always hidden. What does the evangelist mean by this second clause? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Truths never before revealed have now been revealed by Christ's parables, especially by those two which have just been related. For in these it has been affirmed that outsiders, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those belonging to other nations than the Jewish nation, shall seek the protection of the kingdom of heaven, and also that the whole world, including, therefore, these Gentile nations, shall become permeated with its principles. It may well be thought that the clause refers to the announcement of these great truths. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This interpretation, however, if taken alone, is not enough. For the evangelist is not speaking of Christ revealing truths to men generally. On the contrary, he says that Christ does not reveal them to the multi tudes, but to his disciples (cf. ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>) - a contrast which the emphatic language of ver. 34 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) would probably suggest, even though it is not expressly mentioned. It is, therefore, likely that it was this latter fact to which the evangelist specially wished to refer by his quotation of the second clause. Hence, to make his meaning clearer, he has modified its language. As he quotes it, not merely "enigmatical sayings," but "things hidden" (and that from the foundation of the world) are uttered by Christ; but these are now no longer "hidden" to those to whom he speaks them. This complete meaning of the clause - revelation to his disciples of truths before hidden - corresponds to the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11 (where see note) and in St. Paul (cf. especially <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>), and is merely another side of St. Mark's phrase, "Privately to his own disciples he expounded all things" (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 16, 17). It is also possible that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, which is not merely negative, so as to mean "unrevealed," but implies a positive concealment, includes a reference to the thought of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, that God purposely hid these truths from those who were morally unfit to receive them. These, indeed, belonged in general to the times before Christ came, but also "the multitudes" came under this category. If it be asked - What is the relation of the quotation in its context here to the verse in its original context? the easiest answer is that it is only superficial, that the "accidental" employment by the psalmist of the word "parable" was the only reason why the evangelist made the quotation. Yet it may not be quite so; for there was a real similarity between the psalmist teaching his contemporaries by history and Christ teaching his contemporaries by truths couched in narrative form. May we not go even further, and say that in both cases the message was, generally speaking, refused, though in both a remnant of those who heard it were saved (cf also <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-13</a>; <span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">?</span>

The interpretation of the following clause, naturally suggested by this word in itself is that our Lord meant to indicate the possibilities that lay before a Jewish scribe if he were only converted; but for such a reference by our Lord to Jewish scribes  there appears no reason in the context. The word must therefore be understood of Christian teachers, who by their study of the Gospel should hold a position in the Christian Church parallel to that of scribes among the Jews. It is possible that our Lord chose the term in order to accustom his disciples to the idea of carrying on the study of Divine things which the scribes were accustomed to make. Even if the disciples were not to follow their methods they might well imitate their devotion Dean Plumptre has an interesting note on our Lord's comparison of his own work and that of the apostles after him, to the work of the scribes of the Jewish schools. In <a href="../../par/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a> is found a wider application of the term than usual, hardly referring, however, to Christians, but rather to the Jewish scribes in their ideal character. <span class="cmt_word">Which is instructed</span>; <span class="accented">who hath been made a disciple</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>). Though the correction is right (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), the word, nevertheless, implies much more than mere admission to the circle of disciples it includes also the thought of instruction having been really received. <span class="cmt_word">Unto</span> (<span class="accented">to</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">the kingdom of</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, dative of reference; cf. Winer, &sect; 31:4). The kingdom is not regarded as the teacher, but as the school, with reference to which discipleship is entered upon. <span class="cmt_word">Is like.</span> In the preceding parables the general principles, etc., of the kingdom of heaven have been compared; here, only certain individuals belonging to it. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>, note). The thing signified is his experience and spiritual understanding. Ch. 12:35 has a similar thought, but the treasure there is rather his personality as affecting his life; here, as affecting his intellect. It is curious that the thought of <a href="../../par/matthew/12-33.htm">Matthew 12:33, 34</a> should also resemble our vers. 47-50. <span class="cmt_word">Things new and old.</span> The thought of the saying is that as a householder brings out from his stores food recently and long ago acquired (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/7-13.htm">Song of Solomon 7:13</a>), so a Christian "scribe" brings out (primarily, if not solely, for the use of others) the new truths that he learns, and also old ones that he has long since known. It is thus a promise that the disciples shall (if they use their opportunities rightly) be able to do more than understand Christ's teaching (as they have just claimed to have done); for they shall be able to teach (not merely to learn), and that not only new truths, but also old ones; they shall be able, that is to say, to understand the relation of the old to the new, and to bring out even the old in its true meaning, Hence <span class="accented">old</span> is mentioned after <span class="accented">new</span>, for it implies greater knowledge and skill. It will be observed that Irenaeus' interpretation (IV. 9:1) of <span class="accented">new and old</span> as the New and Old Testaments is only partially right. With the disciples, it is true, the <span class="accented">old</span> would naturally be, in the first place, Old Testament truths, and the <span class="accented">new</span>, such truths as they learned from Christ; but these also would, after a few weeks or months, in their turn become old to them, and the fresh truths taught them as their life went on would be ever the new ones. The thought of <a href="../../par/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7, 8</a> is very similar. Weiss' interpretation is different and even less right. According to him, <span class="accented">new</span> represents the truths about the kingdom of God, and <span class="accented">old</span> the long known arrangements of nature and human life, which, as the parables show, are drawn up on the same hues. Origen gives a beautiful application of <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-10.htm">Leviticus 26:10, 11</a><span class="accented">a</span>.
