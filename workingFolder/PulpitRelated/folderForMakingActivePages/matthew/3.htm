"The Lord is gracious" was a fitting title for one born by the special grace of God, and sent to be the herald of his grace to all men (<a href="../../par/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Baptist</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Jews were far from having attained the simplicity of our present system, by which each person has both a family and a Christian name, and is thus designated with sufficient exactness for all the ordinary purposes of life. Their custom of name-giving was, and still largely is, as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> A Hebrew name is given to the child at circumcision. This is the holy name, and is used at all strictly religious ceremonies; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> when called to read the Law in the synagogue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Each person has a name whereby he is known among the Gentiles. This is, at the present time, the name used for business and social purposes, and may be either Hebrew or of some ether language. It is usually connected, either in sound or meaning, with the holy name. So Paul and Saul, Didymus and Thomas (for numerous examples, cf. Hamburger, 'Real-Encycl.,' vol. 2. pp. 831-836. Lowe, 'Memorbook of Nurnberg,' pp. 18-28: 1881). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> He may have, either as well as or instead of the last, a name which designates him more exactly <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) by mentioning his father or some other relation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bartimaeus, Barsabbas (probably); (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) by mentioning some physical, mental, moral, or other peculiarity; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> James the Little, Simon the Zealot, Barnabas (the son of exhortation), and, from non-biblical authors, James the Just, Rabbi Judah the Holy, Samuel the Astronomer, John the Shoemaker. The title "the Baptist" belongs, of course, to this last class, and must have been given him partly because of the number of persons whom he baptized, and still more because baptism was the visible and external aim and result of his preaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What was there new in John's baptism? In considering this it must be remembered that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> dipping in water had been commanded in the Law as a religious rite to priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>) on their first consecration to their office, and on each occasion that they fulfilled the holiest parts of their duties (cf. the sprinklings of the Levites on their consecration, <a href="../../par/numbers/8-5.htm">Numbers 8:5-22</a>); and to all Israelites in cases of ceremonial uncleanness (<a href="../../par/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> It was very frequent among the Essenes (cf. especially the quotations from Josephus in Bishop Lightfoot, 'Colossians,' p. 171, edit. 1875). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> It was, we can hardly doubt, already customary at the admission of proselytes. There are, indeed, no certain allusions in Josephus, Philo, and the older Targumists (cf. Leyrer, in Cremer, <span class="accented">s.v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>) to the baptism of proselytes properly so called; but (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) it is distinctly mentioned in the Mishna, and in such a way as to imply that it was an ancient custom, for the schools of both Shammai and Hillel assume it as a matter of course ('Pes,' 8:8); (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) as with books, so with customs, acceptance in two bodies originally one, as the Jewish and Christian Churches were, throws back the book or custom before the date of the separation. In other words, it is most improbable that Jews would only have begun to practise baptism at the admission of proselytes after it had been practised by a body which had separated from them. Jews would not be likely to adopt the distinguishing rite of Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Thus already, before John's time, baptism was largely practised as a symbol of purification from sin and of entrance on a new and holier life. Wherein, then, lay the distinguishing feature of John's baptism? Apparently in its being extended to all Israelites, without their having any personal ceremonial hindrance, and more particularly in the special aim and purpose to which it now referred. <span class="accented">It signified the entrance upon a new life of expectation of Messiah.</span> As of old, the nation had accepted the offer of God's kingdom, and, having washed their garments (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10, 14</a>), had been sprinkled with blood (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>), so now, when this kingdom, was about to be more fully manifested, not the nation, indeed, considered as a whole, but (in harmony with the individualization of the gospel) those persons who responded to the invitation, came forward and publicly renounced their sins and professed their expectation of the kingdom (Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:274). It is thus easy to account for the deep and widespread impression made by John the Baptist  (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-3.htm">Acts 19:3</a>), and for the important position that he holds in summaries of the origins of Christianity. John's baptism was treated by our Lord himself as the first stage in his earthly ministry, which culminated in the gift of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>), and naturally by the apostles as the historical introduction to the teaching and work of Messiah. Josephus's account of John the Baptist is well known, but too interesting to be omitted. "Now, some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army [by Aretas] came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John that was called the Baptist. For Herod had had him put to death, though he was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue both as to righteousness towards one another and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for baptism would be acceptable to God, if they made use of it, not in order to expiate some sins, but for the purification of the body, provided that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now, as many flocked to him, for they were greatly moved by hearing his words, Herod, fearing that the great influence John had over the people might lead to some rebellion (for the people seemed ready to do anything he should advise), thought it far best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties by sparing a man who might make him repent of his leniency when it should he too late. Accordingly, he was sent a prisoner, in consequence of Herod's suspicious temper, to Machaerus, the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death. So the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and was a mark of God's displeasure against him" ('Ant,' 18:5. 2, Shilleto's Whiston). Observe that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Josephus confirms the Gospel account of the extent of John's influence over his countrymen; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> attributes his imprisonment and death to a political, not a moral, cause. It is quite possible, on the one hand, that political reasons were not altogether wanting; and, on the other, that Josephus was ignorant of the more personal and stronger motive of Herod's action. <span class="cmt_word">Preaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). Unlike <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> this word refers, not to the matter, but to the manner, the openness, of the proclamation. In contrast to the esoteric methods alike of heathen philosophers and of Jewish teachers, whether Pharisees, Sadducees, or Essenes. The herald proclaims as a herald; cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a> (the original context of our ver. 3); <a href="../../par/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a> (LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">In the wilderness</span>. By this term is not necessarily meant absolute desert, but "des lieux pen habites ou non cultives" (Neubauer, 'Geogr. du Talm.,' p. 52: 1868). The very place in which John preached was part of the symbolism of his whole life. The expectation of Messiah must lead to separation, but separation deeper than that of those who called themselves the "separated" (Pharisees). <span class="cmt_word">Of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Judea</span>. The exact expression comes elsewhere only in the title of <a href="../../par/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a>, and in <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, where it is defined as "in the south of Arad." It seems that, while different parts of the rugged district from Jericho southwards (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>), immediately on the west and north of the Dead Sea, had their distinctive titles - the wilderness of Siph (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14, 15</a>), of Maon (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-24.htm">1 Samuel 23:24</a>), of Engedi (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>), of Jeruel (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-16.htm">2 Chronicles 20:16</a>), of Tekoa (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) - the whole district was, as belonging to the tribe and even more certainly to the kingdom and province of Judah, known by the name of "the wilderness of Judaea." According to tradition, John was now preaching near Jericho. We find him soon after this at Bethany beyond Jordan (<a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>), and later still at tenon, near Salim, in, or on the borders of, Samaria (<a href="../../par/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (omitted by the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>. The parallel passages give the substance of John's preaching - the baptism of repentance. St. Matthew takes, as it seems, a sentence that actually fell from his lips, and presents it as the kernel of his message ("preaching...  saying"). This is the more interesting as nowhere else are we told any words uttered by him in this the first stage of his ministry before crowds flocked to hear him. <span class="cmt_word">Repent ye...  at hand</span>; said word for word by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>, note). <span class="accented">Repent ye</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) . The word expresses the central thought of true repentance, in speaking, as it does, of a change of mind. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-10</a>). As such it goes deeper than the Old Testament summons "Turn ye" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span>), or the rabbinic <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span>, for it points out in what part of man the alteration must be. (On <span class="accented">your</span> meaning more than the mere thinking power, and including also the willing faculty, cf. especially Delitzsch, 'Psych.,' p. 211, etc., Eng. trans., 1875.) It is noticeable that the LXX. never, as it seems, translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, but often <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span> (of man only in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>; and <span class="accented">possibly</span> <a href="../../par/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>), which refers to repentance as a matter of feeling. As Messiah was coming, it was only natural that John should urge repentance. Similarly, we find late Jewish writers expounding <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, "'And the Spirit of God was moving [on the face of the waters].' This is the Spirit of King Messiah, like that which is said in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, 'And the Spirit  of the Lord shall rest upon him.' By what kind of merit does it draw near and come? It says, 'upon the face of the waters.' By the merit of repentance, which is compared to water, as it is written (Lain. 2:19), 'Pour out thy heart like water'" ('Bresh. R.,' &sect; 2). But, unfortunately, they assign far too legal a meaning to the word, and their phrase, "do repentance" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span>), becomes almost identical with the "do penance" (<span class="accented">poeni-tentiam agite</span>, Vulgate) of the Roman Catholics (cf. Talm. Dab., 'Sanh.,' 97 b). <span class="cmt_word">For the kingdom of heaven</span> (see Introduction, p. 22.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.

In <a href="../../par/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> the following quotation is uttered by the Baptist himself, and some commentators have supposed this to be the case also here. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this is against the parallel passages in Mark and Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The form of the expression in John arises directly from the context. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In the Baptist's mouth the neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>) rather than the masculine would have been more natural. The expression is doubtless that of the evangelist, suggested to him by John's own utterance, the "is" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) expressing John's permanent character. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, (ver. 4) of his clothing and food. [<span class="accented">He that was</span>] <span class="accented">spoken of.</span> The expression means, not a mere reference found in Isaiah, but the absolute content of the prophet's words.

The Hebrew probably joins "in the wilderness" with "prepare ye," but St. Matthew with "crying" (cf ver. 1, "preaching in the wilderness," as probably the LXX.) In Isaiah the original meaning of the passage was probably, "prepare for the return to Jerusalem." The figure is that of the common and necessary process in semi-civilized countries of repairing roads before a great personage comes along them. Zechariah had; years before, applied the similar expression in <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> to his son (<a href="../../par/luke/1-76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2</a>). (For a metaphor like in kind, but with contrasted meaning, cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, breaking up a road to render it impassable.) <span class="cmt_word">Paths</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>).

It is thus equivalent to the Hebrew (<span class="accented">m</span> <span class="accented">sillah</span>, "a highway," "a made road"). Possibly the plural was employed by the LXX. rather than the singular of the original, from their interpreting the passage, not of the return of the Lord to Palestine, but his coming into many hearts.

"The wings and legs are torn off, and the remainder is sprinkled with salt, and either boiled or eaten roasted" (Meyer). They are mentioned in Talm. Bab., 'Ab.

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> forbids the identification of these locusts with the pods of the carob, or locust tree, such as the prodigal son would fain have eaten. It seems that Jewish Christians of Essene and therefore vegetarian tendencies read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (cakes) here. Such at least is the most natural meaning, accepted by Epiphanius, of a quotation which he gives from the Ebionite Gospel according to the Hebrews (<span class="accented">vide</span> Tischendorf, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) (On the theory that John the Baptist was an Essene, cf. Bishop Lightfoot, 'Colossians,' p, 161, edit. 1875.) <span class="cmt_word">And wild honey</span>. This apparently simple phrase is, notwithstanding, of doubtful interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Probably the honey of wild bees. This is still to be found in trees and rocks, and  must have been much more common before the greater part of the timber was cut down (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-25.htm">1 Samuel 14:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>). Bee-keeping was a favourite pursuit of the Essenes (Philo, 2. p. 633), and the Talmud has frequent notices of hives and the methods of taking bees, etc. (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hamburger, 'Real-Encyc,' 1. <span class="accented">s.v</span>. "Biene"). Hence the need for the addition of some such epithet as "wild," although there seems to be no independent parallel instance of the exact word used (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. Pliny's "mel silvestre." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Possibly "tree-honey" (so Weiss, 'Marc.,' p. 44; 'Life,' 1:308), a sweet vegetable juice obtained from dates (<span class="accented">vide</span> Josephus, <span class="accented">infra</span>) and grapes (as probably in Gem 43:11; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), and perhaps directly from wild trees, such as the manna ash and the tamarisk. So distinctly Suidas (A.D. 1100). "The forerunner ate locusts and wild honey, which is gathered together from the trees, and is commonly called manna." Diodorus Siculus ( <span class="date">B.C. 8</span>) seems to use the epithet "wild" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to distinguish this vegetable honey from that commonly in use (cf. Nicholson, 'Gosp. Hebrews,' p. 35). Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:08. 3) states that in the plain watered by the fountain of Jericho, "there are many sorts of palm trees watered by it, different from each other in taste and name; the better sort of them, when they are pressed, yield an excellent kind of honey (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), not much inferior to other honey. This country withal produces honey from bees (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)."

The marginal reading, however, proposed by the American Revisers "for baptism," does not do justice to the article. The Gospel according to the Hebrews (Resch, 'Agrapha.' p. 343) says that they were in fact baptized, but we can hardly suppose this to have been the case after John's words to them. Observe that the Pharisees, with their  self-conscious sanctity, were hardly likely to come to confess their sins, or the Sadducees to even listen to so ascetic a teacher. He said unto them; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the Pharisees and Sadducees; Luke, less exactly, "to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him." There is, indeed, nothing, save the opening sentence, which refers solely to the Pharisees and Sadducees; but this fact does not show (Bleek) that the words were really spoken to all, and that Matthew's expression is wrong. John doubtless addressed the Pharisees and Sadducees primarily; but as, after all, they only formed the apex of ordinary Jewish thought, what he said to them fitted also the majority of his listeners. <span class="cmt_word">O generation</span> (<span class="accented">ye offspring</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">of vipers!</span> The simile not only expresses the thought that, behind their smooth exterior, the outward legal strictness of the Pharisees, and the worldly decorum of the Sadducees, lay hidden malice and venom, but also that this is due to their very nature. It may have directly implied that they belonged in a true sense to the seed of the serpent (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>); cf. our Lord's words (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath</span> (omitted by the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">warned you?</span> The verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) has elsewhere in the New Testament (St. Luke's writings only) no thought of warning, nor of secrecy, but of teaching, of placing the matter under the eyes of others (cf. especially <a href="../../par/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47</a>).

Whoever can have told you of your danger? He might have saved himself the trouble, you being what you are! Yet the very violence of his expression was such as to call their attention to the depth of their sinfulness, and after all to lead them perhaps to repentance. For this reason he adds, "Bring forth therefore." <span class="cmt_word">To flee</span>; aorist, not exactly indicating "the activity as momentary, setting forth the point of time when the wrath breaks forth, in which the flight also is realized" (Meyer), but the flight as one single action, without any reference to the time of the breaking forth of the wrath. <span class="cmt_word">From</span>. The wrath is pictured as coming on them from without. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a> St. Paul says that Jesus delivers out of (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) it, implying that he himself and all men are naturally in and under it (but see <a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">The wrath to come</span>.

As it was recognized on all hands that the promise of blessing was made to Abraham and his seed, it is no wonder that many Jews presumed upon their descent from him, "sup, posing,", as Justin Martyr says ('Trypho,' &sect; 140.), that the everlasting kingdom will assuredly be given to those who are of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, although they be sinners and unbelieving and disobedient towards God." In later times, when the doctrine of merit was more fully established, God could be represented as saying to Abraham, "If thy children were like dead bodies without sinews or bones, thy merit would avail for them" ('Ber. Rabb.,' on Genesis 10:5:11. &sect; 44,  middle). In John's words, on the contrary, we have the germ of the doctrine afterwards Brought out by St. Paul (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/galatians/3-9.htm">Galatians 3:9, 29</a>), that not natural descent, but spiritual relationship by faith, leads to inheriting the promises. The argument in <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, etc., is closely akin to that presented here.

Hence, perhaps, the exact expression (contrast <a href="../../par/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>), "We have Abraham as father," which brings out the protecting influence of Abraham as still available. <span class="cmt_word">For I say unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>).

After our ver. 10 St. Luke inserts details of the various kinds of fruit that repentance ought to produce, suggested by the questions of different portions of the Baptist's audience; and then, with an explanatory note that John's words were due to a misconception having arisen that he was himself the Messiah, he adds what we have in vers. 11, 12. But even if vers. 0-12 were, in fact, not said consecutively, yet their juxtaposition here may be defended by the real connexion between the statements. In ver. 10 John has spoken of the present danger of his audience; he therefore now urges repentance, and that in view of the coming of One who will sift them to the uttermost. <span class="cmt_word">With water</span>; <span class="accented">in</span>, Revised Version margin (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>), and so in the second part of the verse.

The duty of slaves of the lowest rank. The distance of superiority here attributed by John to "him that cometh after me," must be reckoned even greater than it usually is; for most of the slaves then held by Jewish masters would not be Jews, but Gentiles. The thought is, "I am further removed from my successor than the meanest Gentile slave is from his Jewish master." Some have seen in this expression a reference to the practice of disciples carrying the shoes of their teachers (Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:272), but this can hardly have been general so early. <span class="cmt_word">He</span>. The emphasis is made the more evident by the absence of any connecting particle. <span class="cmt_word">Shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">baptize you</span>.

To the visible John contrasts the invisible, to the symbol of water the reality of the Spirit; adding (here and in the parallel passage in Luke) to this, which forms the main point of the contrast (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>), the thought of <a href="../../par/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, purification as by fire; and, by not placing it under the government of another preposition (which would have necessitated the conception of it as a distinct element) implying that it is only another aspect of one and the same baptism. It has been questioned, indeed, whether "fire" here refers to the purification of the godly who truly accept the baptism of the Spirit, or to the destruction of the wicked, as in vers. 10, 12. But the thought is one. The Divine presence will in fact, as is recognized by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>), be twofold in its working, according as it is yielded to or the reverse.

Alford, "requirements of the Law' and especially Lowe. 'Pesach Fragm.,' p. 100: 1879), but of that wider righteousness of which that was itself only a part and a type. "Let me be baptized by thee now," our Lord says to John, "for it is fitting for us, in this spirit of submission, to fill up every part of righteousness." Our <span class="accented">Lord</span> thus pleads for the absolute submission of John and himself to every portion of righteousness as it may be proposed to them by God to perform; his words thus somewhat resembling those to St. Peter, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me" (<a href="../../par/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8</a>). Thy duty is to baptize, mine to be baptized. It has generally been thought that in this verse our Lord implies that his baptism was to constitute his own formal recognition and acceptance of his distinctly Messianic duties - an act which involved the complete leaving of his past life and the giving himself up to a new and public life (cf. Weiss, 'Life,' 1:322). But have we any evidence that our Lord came to the baptism with this self-consciousness? May he not very well have known that he was to be the Messiah, and yet not have known that his official life was to begin now? May  he not have come to the baptism merely as an individual, feeling the deepest interest in this consecration to the cause of the kingdom, notwithstanding the unique position in which he knew himself to stand with regard to that kingdom? But his voluntary consecration of himself for whatever he might be guided to, was the opportunity taken by the Father for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost, which had as its immediate consequence the retirement into the wilderness and the decision there come to. May not, in other words, our Lord's descent into Jordan have been, not the first act of his public life, but the last act of his private life - the former then being the withdrawal into the wilderness, in order there to have uninterrupted communion with his Father, and to meet in his official character his great adversary (cf. especially Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:279, etc.)? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, when he was baptized</span>. Combining the statements of the synoptists, we may conclude that Jesus went up from the water at once, praying as he went, and that, while he was going up and praying, the heavens opened. <span class="cmt_word">Out of</span>; <span class="accented">from</span> '(Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>; for, as it seems, he had not gone fully out of the water. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens were opened unto him</span>. So also the Revised Version, but the Revised Version margin, with Westcott and Herr, rightly omits "unto him." The words were inserted because it was thought that Jesus alone saw the manifestation, as indeed we should have supposed if we had had only the account of St. Mark, who reads, "he saw" before "the heavens being rent asunder" (but cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32-34</a>). To our Lord and to the Baptist the appearance was as though the sky really opened (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of God</span>; recalling <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. "Messiah now enters on his public office, and for that receives, as true Man, the appropriate gifts. The Spirit by whom men are sub jectively united to God descends upon the Word made Flesh, by whom objectively God is revealed to men" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Like</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> (Revised Version). The comparison is hardly to the gentleness of the descent of a dove, but to a visible appearance in bodily form, as a dove (see parallel passage in Luke). Not, of course, that the Holy Spirit was thus at all incarnate, but that either the appearance of a dove was seen by John's eyes only (cf. especially Theodore of Mopsuestia, in Meyer), or, as is not unlikely (even though the suggestion belongs ultimately to Paulus), a dove really flew down and lighted on the Lord (Luke), and that this, to outsiders merely a curious incident (cf. <a href="../../par/john/12-29.htm">John 12:29</a>), was to our Lord and the Baptist a sign of spiritual blessing. <span class="cmt_word">A dove</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>); any member of the pigeon tribe; chosen because a symbol of deliverance (<a href="../../par/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8</a>), of purity (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>), of harmlessness (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), and of endearment (<a href="../../par/songs/6-9.htm">Song of Solomon 6:9</a>). There is no evidence (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:287) that the dove was <span class="accented">at this period</span> interpreted by Jews as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. The Targum on <a href="../../par/songs/2-12.htm">Song of Solomon 2:12</a> paraphrasing "the voice of the turtle-dove ' by "the voice of the Holy Spirit," dates in its present form from the eighth to the tenth century. The dove mentioned (though probably by interpolation) in the account of Polycarp's death, appears to be a symbol of the soul (cf. Bishop Lightfoot). Wichelhaus (as quoted by Kubel) says suggestively, "lamb and dove  - no kingdom in the world has these emblems on its escutcheon." <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; omit, with manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">Lighting</span>; <span class="accented">coming</span> (Revised Version), because it is needless to translate a common Greek (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) by a rare English word. Observe that it refers to the Holy Spirit, not to the dove as such. <span class="cmt_word">Upon him</span> (so Luke and <a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>; Mark more vaguely, "unto him"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo</span>; peculiar to St. Matthew - a reminiscence of Aramaic diction. <span class="cmt_word">A voice</span>. Similarly in <a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a> (Transfiguration, cf. <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17, 18</a>); <a href="../../par/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a> (like thunder); [possibly <a href="../../par/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6</a>, Pentecost]; <a href="../../par/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a> (Paul's conversion); 10:13, 15 (Peter). Talmudic and rabbinic writings often mention the Bath-Qol as speaking from heaven. The character of the occasions on which the voice is heard in the New Testament on the one hand, and in the Jewish writings on the other, shows the complete difference in the moral aspect of the two voices. The latter is at best little more than a parody of the former. (For the meaning of the expression Bath-Qol <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Weber, p. 188; Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:285.) <span class="cmt_word">From</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven</span>; <span class="accented">out of the heavens</span> (Revised Version), pointing to the phrase in ver. 16. <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>. Western authorities add, "unto him," mostly reading the following words in the second person (cf. Mark and Luke). <span class="cmt_word">This is my beloved Son</span>. Very similar if not identical words were spoken at the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>), Matthew giving precisely the same, Mark and Luke only omitting "in whom I am well pleased," and Luke also reading "chosen" instead of "beloved." It would seem more natural to suppose that the words spoken on the two occasions were really slightly different, and that therefore Matthew is the less accurate. <span class="accented">My</span> .... <span class="accented">Son</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>). <span class="accented">My beloved Son.</span> The expression is probably based on <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, Matthew 12:18, note); but this does not necessitate the punctuation of the Revised Version margin, and Westcott and Herr margin: "My Son; my beloved  in whom," etc. (For the expression, comp. also <a href="../../par/mark/12-6.htm">Mark 12:6</a> (not in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/matthew/21-37.htm">Matthew 21:37</a>); <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In whom I am well pleased;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in whom I have delight</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>, Authorized Version). The tense (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) is equivalent to "my delight" fell on him, he became the object of my love" (Winer, 40:5, b, 2). The Spirit came, the Father bore witness. "Thus the Baptist receives through a revelation the certainty of the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus the reader learns that the Son of David, who through his birth (ch. 1.) and the fortunes of his childhood (ch. 2.) was certified as the Messiah, now also is announced to the last of the prophets as the Son of God, to whom Jehovah, in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, etc., had promised the Messianic dominion of the world" (Weiss, 'Matthaus-Evang.'). Yet not only so; the words probably revealed to the Lord Jesus himself more of his exact relationship to the Father than he had before as Man realized. Such an assurance of his true nature, and of the Father's delight in him, would be of essential service in strengthening him for his work (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>). There are two other matters connected with our Lord's baptism recorded by tradition (cf. especially Resch, 'Agrapha,'pp. 346-367)-additional words spoken, and an additional sign given. The words spoken are found in "Western" authorities of <a href="../../par/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee," evidently with a desire to emphasize the application of the second psalm. The additional sign is the light or fire. The simplest form of this is (Tatian's 'Diatessaron,' edit. Zahn), "A light rose upon the waters;" and in the Ebionite Gospel apud Epiph., "Immediately a great light shone round about the place;" more fully in Justin Martyr ('Trypho,' &sect; 88), "When Jesus had gone down into the water, fire was kindled in the Jordan;" also in a now lost 'Pred. Paul,' "When he was being baptized, fire was seen upon the water;" and in the Cod. Vercellensis of the Old Latin, "When he was being baptized, an immense light shone round from the water, so that all who had come thither were afraid." Although there is no intrinsic objection to this symbol having taken place, it is very improbable that in this case the evangelists would not have recorded it. The legend may have arisen from ver. 11, or, and more probably, from an endeavour to make the baptism parallel to the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>); cf. Ephraem, in Resch ('Agrapha,' p. 358), "John drew near and worshipped the Son, whose form an unwonted lustre surrounded." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
