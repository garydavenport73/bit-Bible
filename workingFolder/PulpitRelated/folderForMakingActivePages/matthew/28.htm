It is to be noted that there are great and important variations in the four (or, with St. Paul's, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, the five) accounts of the events of the Resurrection, which have given welcome occasion to the sceptic to cast doubts upon the whole transaction. The divergences in the narratives are plainly to be ascribed to the facts that the writers did not depend upon one another, nor draw their accounts from one source; that each gives only an incomplete history, introducing those details with which he was familiar, or which it suited his plan to recount. On all main points the agreement is perfect, and every difference could be easily reconciled, if we knew the whole of the circumstances and the exact sequence of each word and act during this momentous period. Attempts at harmonizing the various accounts have been made with more or less success by writers from St. Augustine to the present time; but as they vary in many particulars, and have no authoritative basis, dependence cannot be placed upon them. The narrative in St. Matthew is brief and imperfect, and we shall chiefly confine our remarks to the exposition of the actual text before us, without importing much matter from the other evangelists. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the end of the sabbath</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">late on the sabbath</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">vespere sabbati.</span> The expression is obscure. In the parallel passage of St. Mark we read, "When the sabbath was past." We must take it that St. Matthew is thinking of the sabbath as extending, not from evening to evening, but till the following morning. "So that it is not the accurate Jewish division of time, according to which the sabbath ended at six on Saturday evening, but the ordinary civil idea of a day, which extended from sunrise to sunrise (or at least adds the night to the preceding day)" (Lange). We have, then, now arrived at the commencement of the first Christian Easter Day. As it began to dawn toward the first day of the week; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">in prima sabbati</span> (Vulgate); literally, <span class="accented">unto one day of sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one day after the sabbath, the Jews reckoning their days in sequence from the sabbath, and Christians at first carrying on the same practice, as we see in <a href="../../par/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>. Later Christians named the days of the week in sequence from the Sunday, which was the first day, Monday being the second day, <span class="accented">feria secunda</span>, and so on. <span class="cmt_word">Came Mary Magdalene</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the other Mary</span> (see on Matthew 27:61) <span class="cmt_word">to</span> <span class="cmt_word">see the sepulchre</span>. Love cannot abandon its object, living or dead. There were probably other women with these two, or perhaps there were two separate bands of women who in this early morning visited the sepulchre. Among these Mary Magdalene stands prominently forward, first in love and first in care. She and the rest evidently knew nothing of the sealing of the stone or the posting of the guards. St. Matthew's expression, "to see (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to gaze upon," "contemplate") the sepulchre," conveys only a partial notice of the object of their visit. They came not only to take a view of the tomb, but also to embalm the Lord's body, for which necessary preparations had been made, the approach of the sabbath on the evening of the Crucifixion having cut short the arrangements. We know from St. Mark that they were perplexed about the difficulty of removing the stone, and St. Matthew may be referring to a preliminary inspection made in regard of this impediment. Our Gospel omits mention of the intention of embalming the corpse, as the Resurrection rendered it impracticable; and, indeed, the Lord's body had already been anointed for his burial by Mary of Bethany. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold.</span> A wonderful sight met their eyes. The following event took place before their arrival; they saw only the result. No mortal eye beheld, and no pen has recorded, the actual issuing of the Lord from the closed tomb. <span class="cmt_word">There was a great earthquake.</span> St. Matthew does not attempt to give the exact sequence of events. Probably the shock, caused by the sudden advent and action of the angel, befell as the women were approaching the cemetery. Christ had risen before this occurrence, nothing being a barrier to his spiritual body. <span class="cmt_word">For the angel of the Lord...  from the door.</span> The narrator accounts for the phenomenon just mentioned. The words, "from the door," are omitted by the best manuscripts, the Vulgate, and modern editors, and seem to be a marginal interpolation. The angel rolled away the stone which Joseph had rolled up (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>), not in order to afford passage to the body of the Lord, who had already raised himself, but to give the women and others entrance to the empty tomb, and to strike terror into the heart of the soldiers. In the case of  Lazarus the stone had to be removed to give exit to the resuscitated body - a natural body (<a href="../../par/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39, 41</a>); in the case of Jesus such removal was not necessary, as his was a spiritual body, possessed of supernatural powers and qualities (<a href="../../par/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sat upon it</span>. In triumph, and to show that it was not to be replaced; death had done its work, and now was vanquished. Angels' appearances had always accompanied the great events in the history of the chosen people; angels had shown themselves at Christ's birth, at his temptation, at his agony; now they guard his tomb, proving that he was well pleasing unto the Lord, and was raised from the grave by him. The narration of this awful incident was probably given by the soldiers, who alone witnessed it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a></div><div class="verse">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His countenance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">appearance</span>) was like lightning. The angel's aspect was as bright and startling as the flash of lightning (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-14.htm">Ezekiel 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His raiment white as snow.</span> Pure and glistening, like the effect of the Transfiguration on the Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-4.htm">Matthew 28:4</a></div><div class="verse">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i>men</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And for fear of him;</span> <span class="accented">but from the fear of him.</span> From the fear inspired by this awful angel. It would seem, from this expression, that the soldiers were sensible, not only of the earthquake and the movement of the stone, but also of the presence of the heavenly messenger, in this respect differing from the companions of Daniel and St. Paul, who were only partially conscious of the visions beheld by the two saints (see <a href="../../par/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did shake.</span> The verb is cognate with the noun "earthquake;" they were shaken, convulsed with terror. If these were some of the company that had watched the Crucifixion, they were already possessed of some feeling respecting the unearthly nature of the Occupant of the tomb which they were guarding, and had a vague expectation of something that might happen. At any rate, they must have heard the late events discussed by their comrades, and were not without apprehension of a catastrophe. Became as dead men. They fell to the ground in deathlike faintness, and, when they recovered from the trance, fled in terror from the tomb into the city (ver. 11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel answered and said.</span> The women arrived probably while the guards were lying unconscious on the ground. They saw them, and they saw the angel rotting on the stone, or, according to St. Mark, "a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe;" St. Luke says that "two men stood by them in dazzling apparel," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> first one had shown himself, and then another. Doubtless innumerable angels were thronging around, and one or more became visible to certain persons as they were capable of receiving spiritual impressions, or as these spirits were directed to show themselves. The women spake not, were too affrighted to ask questions; but their amazed look, their blank surprise, were themselves interrogative, and the angel replied to their inward emotion. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not ye</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, emphatic). The soldiers have cause to fear; they are the enemies of the Lord; but ye are his friends, and need feel no alarm. <span class="cmt_word">Ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</span> Ye are seeking him, to do honour to his body; I know your pious intention, but it is useless. The angel shrinks not from the mention of Christ's shameful death, which is now his glory, "the power of God and the wisdom of God" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23, 24</a>). "It was the good pleasure of the Father . .. through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross...  whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19, 20</a>). The crucifixion "was not simply a temporary incident in the life of Christ. It is an eternal principle in his kingdom" (Milligan). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6</a></div><div class="verse">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is not here.</span> He is not in this tomb; his bodily presence is removed from this his whilom resting place. St. Matthew's account is greatly condensed, and omits many details which harmonists try to fit into our text. The attempt is not to be commended, for it really involves greater confusion, and, after all, is forced and only conjectural. <span class="cmt_word">For he is risen, as he said.</span> If they had believed Christ's often-repeated announcement, they would not have come seeking the living among the dead. (For Christ's predictions concerning his resurrection, see <a href="../../par/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-23.htm">Matthew 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>.) On this simple, but pregnant sentence, "He is risen," depends the phenomenon of Christianity, in its origin, existence, continuance, extension, and moral power. "Death began with woman; and to women the first announcement is made of resurrection" (Hilary, quoted by Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> The angel invites them to satisfy themselves that Christ's body was no longer in its resting place. That Jesus was designated as "the Lord," <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by the disciples is obvious (see <a href="../../par/john/20-18.htm">John 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, etc.), but it is doubtful whether the words are genuine here, though they are found in many good manuscripts and in the Vulgate. They are omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, 33, etc., and by Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort in their editions. Regarding them as genuine, Bengel calls them "gloriosa appellatio," which indeed it is, for it is equivalent to "Jehovah." Harmonists suppose that the  angel was at first not seen by the women; that Mary Magdalene, observing the stone removed, at once hurried to the city to tell Peter and John; that, the rest of the women remaining, the angel made himself visible to them and bade them enter the sepulchre; and that, doing so, they beheld another angel sitting on the right side of the recess. Thus, it is conjectured, the accounts in Mark and John may be harmonized with that in our text. (See also Westcott on <a href="../../par/john/20.htm">John 20</a>, where is given a provisional arrangement of the facts of the first Easter Day.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7</a></div><div class="verse">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go quickly, and tell his disciples.</span> St. Mark significantly adds, "and Peter." The disciples were to believe without seeing. They had deserted Christ in his hour of need, had not stood by the cross, nor aided in his burial; so they were not to be honoured with the vision of angels or the first sight of the risen Lord. This was reserved for the faithful women, who thus received their mission to carry a message to the messengers - a foretaste of the ministry which they should perform in the Church of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">He goeth before you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">into Galilee.</span> The verb is noticeable. It is that used by our Lord himself on his way to the garden of Gethsemane (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>), and it implies the act of a shepherd at the head of his flock, leading them to new pastures (comp. <a href="../../par/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a>). The good Shepherd had been smitten, and the sheep scattered; now under his guidance they were to be reunited. The apostolic band had been temporarily dissolved and disintegrated; the college was again to be reformed, and was to receive its renewed commission in seclusion and peace, that it might return to Jerusalem with unimpaired strength to commence its arduous labours. The place of meeting is in Galilee, where most of his mighty works were done, and where it was safer for the disciples to assemble than at Jerusalem. The majority of them came from this region, and thither they returned some ten days (<a href="../../par/john/20-26.htm">John 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1-4</a>) after the Resurrection, to resume their ordinary occupations (ver. 16). Thus they would realize that it was the same Jesus who met them there with whom, these three past years, they had held familiar intercourse. It was ordained, for some reason not expressly stated, that from Galilee should proceed Christ's spiritual kingdom which he came to establish - that "word which," as Peter said (<a href="../../par/acts/10-37.htm">Acts 10:37</a>), "was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee." We read of only two appearances of Christ in Galilee - once at the lake, mentioned in the last chapter of St. John, and again in ver. 17 of this chapter of St. Matthew. It is, however, possible that the appearance named by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), when he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at one time, may have occurred in Galilee. If this is the case, it would be remarkable as the only public revelation of Christ after his resurrection, and the comparative seclusion of the northern district may have been one reason for its selection as the scene for this great demonstration. There was doubtless some moral fitness in the humble and despised Galilee being made the starting point of his Church who was despised and rejected of men whom it was contemptuously said, "Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?" (<a href="../../par/john/7-41.htm">John 7:41</a>). "As in all things God sets at naught the pride of mankind, and chooses persons, instruments, and places mean in the eves of the world, teaching us that in humbler and more retired abodes, secret from the world, we are to seek for the strength of God, who hideth himself" (I. Williams). <span class="cmt_word">Lo, I have told you.</span> The angel thus solemnly confirms what he had just said. The Authorized Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Ecce, praedixi vobis</span>, which is warranted by no existing Greek manuscripts, the uniform reading of the original being <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>

It is not quite in St. Matthew's style, and seems to be rightly regarded as a gloss There is. one advantage in its omission, in that the actual moment of this appearance of our Lord is left undecided, and we are at liberty to harmonize it, if so minded, with other details. Now the women, according to our history, receive the reward of their faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail!</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">Rejoice ye!</span> This is not the usual Eastern salutation, "Peace be unto you!" but one that came with peculiar significance on their lately sorrow-stricken hearts. So he had said to his apostles, "Your sorrow shall be turned into joy" (<a href="../../par/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>), and now he made good his word. This is the only one of Christ's appearances in Jerusalem or its neighbourhood. that St. Matthew relates. <span class="cmt_word">They came and</span>  <span class="cmt_word">held him by the feet</span> (<span class="accented">took hold of his feet</span>). As soon as they saw him, they went to him with glad surprise, and yet with such awe, that they could only fall down before him and tenderly clasp his feet. He had appeared before this to Mary Magdalene (<a href="../../par/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>), but had not permitted her to touch him because he had not yet ascended to the Father (<a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), implying thereby either that she would have other opportunities of holding converse with him, as he was not going to leave the earth immediately, and she must not detain him now; or, more probably, that the spiritual body demanded, not the touch of earthly affection, but the attitude of awe and reverence, and that all future contact would be supernatural and spiritual, realizing his presence after a heavenly and supersensuous manner by faith. But these women clung to Christ with something higher than natural, earthly affection, acknowledging his superhumanity, and he allowed them, like Thomas, to assure themselves of his corporeity by touch as well as sight. <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him.</span> They remained at his feet in profound adoration.

Why St. Matthew mentions none of these we may form conjectures, but we cannot determine (see on ver. 16).

Their task was done; the corpse was gone, they knew not how taken; they could not be expected to contend with supernatural visitants, or to guard against supernatural occurrences. St. Matthew seems to have introduced this incident in order to account for the prevalence of the lying rumour which he proceeds to mention, and which had been widely disseminated among his countrymen. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-12.htm">Matthew 28:12</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the chief priests) <span class="cmt_word">were assembled with the elders.</span> On hearing the report of the soldiers, the Sanhedrists held a hurried and informal meeting, to consult about this alarming matter. It would be fatal to their policy to let the real truth get wind. Such testimony from unprejudiced heathens would infallibly convince the people of the validity of Christ's claims, and produce the very effect which their unusual precautions had been intended to obviate. One course alone remained, and that was to prepare a circumstantial lie concerning one part of the story, and to deny or ignore utterly the supernatural details. The plainest evidence will not persuade against wilful blindness. These rulers acted according to Christ's sad foreboding on another occasion, "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They gave large money</span> (<span class="accented">money enough</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto the soldiers.</span> They bribed the soldiers with a sum of money sufficient to satisfy their cupidity. This they did personally, or more probably through some trusty agent. They never doubted the facts to which the guards bore witness; they never attempted to discredit their story by suggestion of error or superstitious invention. They accepted the tale, and took most dishonourable means to make it innocuous. They had bought the aid of the traitor Judas; they now buy the silence of these soldiers. It. is suggested by St. Jerome that in both cases they made use of the temple funds, thus employing against the cause of God that which was devoted to his service. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-13.htm">Matthew 28:13</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <i>away</i> while we slept.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say ye,</span> etc. They put the lie into the soldiers' mouth, directing them to  answer inquiries in this way. The last resource of an infatuated obstinacy! If they were asleep, how could they know that the disciples stole the body? St. Chrysostom comments well on the infamous transaction, "How did they steal him? O most foolish of all men! For because of the clearness and conspicuousness of the truth, they are not even able to make up a falsehood. For indeed, what they said was highly incredible, and the falsehood had not even speciousness. For how, I ask, did the disciples steal him, men poor and unlearned, and not venturing so much as to show themselves? What? was not a seal put upon it? What? were there not many watchmen and soldiers and Jews stationed round it? What? did not those men suspect this very thing, and take thought, and break their rest, and are in anxiety about it? And wherefore, moreover, did they steal it? That they might feign the doctrine of the resurrection? And how should it enter their minds to feign such a thing - men who were well content to be hidden and to live? And how could they remove the stone that was made sure? How could they have escaped the observation of so many? Nay, though they had despised death, they would not have attempted without purpose and fruitlessly to venture in defiance of so many who were on the watch. And that moreover they were timorous, what they had done before showed clearly: at least, when they saw him seized, all rushed away from him. If, then, at that time they did not dare so much as to stand their ground when they saw him alive, how when he was dead could they but have feared such a number of soldiers?" ('Hem.,' 90.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-14.htm">Matthew 28:14</a></div><div class="verse">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if this come to the governor's ears</span>; <span class="accented">if this be heard before the governor</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if the matter be brought officially before the procurator. For a Roman soldier to sleep on his post was to incur the penalty of death. Pilate would not be likely to hear of what had taken place, as vulgar rumours were not encouraged by his stern and unsympathizing attitude towards the Jewish people, but it was just possible that some officious person might bring the report before him, and ask him to take measures to ascertain the truth, and, if necessary, to punish the delinquents. <span class="cmt_word">We</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">will persuade him.</span> Such persuasion usually took the form of bribery, Roman officials being notoriously venal (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/24-26.htm">Acts 24:26</a>); but perhaps the rulers intended to make him believe that the story was not true, but merely a <span class="accented">ruse</span> to keep the populace quiet. The soldiers must have fully believed in the Sanhedrists' assertion, or they would never have imperilled their lives by promulgating such a condemnatory tale. <span class="cmt_word">Secure you;</span> <span class="accented">rid you of care.</span> They promise the guard indemnity and freedom from all penal consequences. Pilate, however, later learned the great fact of Christ's resurrection, and though, as far as we know, he took no steps towards punishing the guard (being probably convinced of its supernatural occurrence), yet, according to a fragment of Hegesippus, and Eusebius, 'Chronic.,' 2:2, he sent an account of the matter to Tiberius, who, in consequence, endeavoured to make the senate pass a decree enrolling Jesus in the list of Roman gods. This fact is attested by Tertullian ('Apolog.,' 5.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-15.htm">Matthew 28:15</a></div><div class="verse">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This saying;</span> viz. the theft of the body by the disciples. <span class="cmt_word">Is commonly reported</span> (<span class="accented">was spread abroad</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>among the Jews until this day;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and continues to be reported until this day. This was true when St. Matthew wrote, and it is true at the present time, though thoughtful Jews of late years have adopted the idea that the apostles, in their excited state, were deceived by visions of Christ which they took for substantial realities (see on Matthew 27:64). In the passage of Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Tryph.,' 108.) we are told that the Jews sent emissaries in all directions to spread this false report. The evangelist shows the origin of this most improbable tale, and virtually challenges any other explanation of the miracle than the authentic one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - <span class="accented">Our Lord appears to the disciples in Galilee, and gives them a commission to teach and baptize.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew; but comp. <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-18</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the eleven disciples.</span> There is no note of time in the original, which gives merely, <span class="accented">But the eleven</span>, etc. The meeting here narrated took place on some day after the first Easter week. The number "eleven" shows the loss of one of the sacred college, whose complement was not filled up till just before Pentecost (<a href="../../par/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went away into Galilee.</span> St. Matthew takes pains to show the exact fulfilment of Christ's very special injunction and promise concerning Galilee (see vers. 7, 10, and notes there, and <a href="../../par/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>). The evangelist's object being to set forth Christ in his character as King and Lawgiver, he puts aside all other incidents in order to give prominence to this appearance, where Jesus announces his supreme authority (ver. 18), gives the commission to his apostles, and promises his perpetual presence (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_word">Into a mountain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the mountain</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>where</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus had appointed them</span>. We do not know the locality intended, though it must have been some spot familiar to the disciples, and was probably plainly  designated at the time when Christ appointed the meeting. Some have fixed on Tabor as the scene of this revelation, others on the Mount of Beatitudes; but where nothing is stated it is best to lay aside conjecture and accept the designed indefiniteness. Many commentators have determined that this appearance on the Galilaean mountain was that mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), as manifested to five hundred brethren at once. This is a mere conjecture, probable, but not certain. If it was the case, we must consider that St. Matthew singles out the eleven apostles as the most eminent among the company, and those to whom the Lord specially addressed the commission which he mentions. Of the five hundred brethren, St. Paul, writing some twenty years or more after this time, testifies that the greater number were still alive, only some having "fallen asleep." There never was, indeed, any historical fact the authenticity of which was more remarkably and irrefragably certified than the resurrection of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-17.htm">Matthew 28:17</a></div><div class="verse">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They worshipped him.</span> Evidently here they, or the majority of those present (for it is plain that others beside the apostles were there), adored him as God and Lord. This is the first time that this action of supreme worship is mentioned in connection with the disciples, though the women had offered the same homage to him (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">some doubted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> - without <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). (For the verb, comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>.) The doubters could not have been any of the eleven, for they had seen the Lord more than once at Jerusalem, and had had indubitable proofs that he had risen from the dead, and was no mere spirit or spiritual appearance, but possessed of his former body, with new powers, faculties, and laws. Those who for the moment doubted did not hesitate to acknowledge his resurrection, but his identity. They were, perhaps, at a distance. Christ may have appeared surrounded with heavenly glory; at any rate, in a shape, or vesture, or with an aspect with which they were not familiar; hence in this majestic form, they failed to recognize the "despised and rejected of men," the lowly Jesus whom they had known (cf. <a href="../../par/john/21-4.htm">John 21:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus came.</span> Some medieval exegetes have deemed that this verse refers to the time of the ascension; but there is no valid reason for dissociating this portion from the rest of the account. If we do this, we lose the great reason for the oft-enjoined meeting on the Galilaean mountain, which seems to have been expressly and with much care arranged to notify at large the fact of Christ's Resurrection and of his supreme authority, and to convey the Lord's commission to the apostles in the presence of many witnesses. We may suppose that Jesus, who had been standing apart, now drew near <span class="cmt_word">to</span> the company, so that all, especially the doubting, might see him closely and hear his familiar voice. <span class="cmt_word">Spake unto them</span> (<span class="greek_word">e)lalhsen au)toi  =  </span>, <span class="accented">talked unto them</span>). Doubtless he said much more than is here recorded, resolving doubts, confirming faith, infusing comfort. "Thus it is even now; we worship him, and then he draws near, and, by his nearer approaches and secret manifestation of himself to our hearts, we are confirmed in the faith, and see in him God and man" (I. Williams). <span class="cmt_word">All power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is given (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">was given</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto me in</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven and in earth.</span> Jesus here asserts that he, as Son of man, has received from the Father supreme authority in heaven and earth, over the whole kingdom of God in its fullest extent. This is net given to him as Son o! God; for, as God, naught can be added to him or taken from him; it is a power which he has merited by his incarnation, death, and Passion (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-10</a>), which was foretold in the Old Testament, by psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5-8</a>) and prophet (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>), and with which he was indued on the day that he rose victorious from the grave. So the verb "was given" is in the past tense, because it refers to the dotation arranged in God's eternal purpose, and to the actual investiture at the Resurrection. The power is exercised in his mediatorial kingdom, and will continue to be exercised till he hath put all enemies under his feet, and destroyed death itself (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-27</a>); but his absolute kingdom is everlasting; as God and Man he reigns forever and ever. This mediatorial authority extends not only over men, so that he governs and protects the Church, disposes bureau events, controls hearts and opinions; but the forces of heaven also are at his command, the Holy Spirit is bestowed by him, the angels are in his employ as ministering to the members of his body. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a></div><div class="verse">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>). The illative particle is perhaps spurious, but it is implied by what has preceded. It is because Jesus has plenary authority, and can delegate power to whom he will, that he confers the following commission. He is addressing the eleven apostles, of whom alone St. Matthew makes mention (ver. 16); but as they personally could not execute the grand commission in all its extent and duration, he lays his commands upon their representatives and successors in all ages. They were to go forth, and carry the gospel throughout the world. Doubtless herein is implied the duty of all Christians to be in some sense missionaries, to use their utmost efforts to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ, and to make men obedient to his Law. The  propagation of the gospel is a work for all in their several spheres. <span class="cmt_word">Teach</span>; <span class="accented">docete</span> (Vulgate). These are unfortunate renderings of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which means, "make disciples." Teaching is expressed in ver. 20, as one of the elements or components of full discipleship. The imperative aorist <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is, as it were, decomposed by the two following present participles, "baptizing" and "teaching." In the case of infants the process is exactly what is here represented; they are admitted into the Christian society by baptism, and then instructed in faith and duty. Adults have to be instructed before baptism; but they form a small minority in most Christian communities, where, generally, infant baptism is the rule, and would be regarded rather as exceptions. Teaching alone is not stated by the Lord to be the only thing necessary to convert an unbeliever into a Christian; this is effected by the grace of God applied as Christ proceeds to explain. <span class="cmt_word">All nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;</span>). The apostles were no longer to go only to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>); they were to Christianize all the nations of the world, Jew and Gentile alike. The gospel is adapted to all the varying minds and habits of men, barbarous and civilized, near and remote, ignorant or cultivated; and it is the duty and privilege of Christ's ministers to make it known and acceptable in all quarters of the globe. <span class="cmt_word">Baptizing them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> individuals of all the nations. The present participle denotes the mode of initiation into discipleship. Make them disciples by baptizing them. Christ thus explains his mysterious announcement to Nicodemus (<a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>), "Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." To the disciples the notion of baptism was no new thing. As a rite typifying the cleansing of the heart and the purpose of leading a new life, it had been long practised in the case of proselytes to the Jewish faith; they had seen it employed by John the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>), and had used it themselves (<a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>). Christ adopts the old rite, gives it a new solemnity, a most sacred formula of administration, a new meaning, new spiritual effects. The persons to whom and in whose presence he spoke would understand his injunction as applicable to all who were capable of its reception, children and adults, the subjects of the initiatory ceremony of proselytism. There was no need of closer specification. Or, if any such instruction was needed, the rules concerning circumcision would be a sufficient guide. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</span>. Our version follows the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in nomine</span>, which does not give the right force to the expression. The phrase does not mean merely invoking the Name, under the sanction of the great Name, but something more than this. It signifies into the power and influence of the Holy Trinity, into faith in the three Persons of God, and the duties and privileges consequent on that faith, into the family of God and obedience unto its Head. The "into" shows the end and aim of the consecration of baptism. The "Name" of God is that by which he is known to us - that which connotes his being and his attributes, that by which there exists a conscious connection between God and ourselves (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). So being baptized into the Name of God implies being placed in subjection to and communion with God himself, admitted into covenant with him. It is to be observed that the term is "name," not "names," thus denoting the unity of the Godhead in the trinity of Persons. The Lord's words have always been taken as the formula of baptism, and have in all ages been used in its administration. The three Divine Persons were revealed at the baptism of Jesus (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>); they are invoked at every Christian baptism. It is true that we read, in the early Church, of persons being baptized "in the Name of the Lord Jesus," and "in the Name of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/acts/8-16.htm">Acts 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-48.htm">Acts 10:48</a>); but this expression by no means assumes that the names of the other Divine Persons were not used; it denotes that the converts were admitted into the religion which Jesus instituted, in fact, were made Christians. The above formula has from primitive times been considered indispensable for the valid administration of this sacrament (see 'Apost. Can.,' 41; Tertull., 'De Bapt.,' 13; Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' 1:79). "From this sacred form of baptism," says Bishop Pearson, "did the Church derive the rule of faith, requiring the profession of belief in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, before they could be baptized in their Name" ('On the Creed,' art. 1.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a></div><div class="verse">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <i>even</i> unto the end of the world. Amen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the nations) <span class="cmt_word">to observe all things</span>, etc. The word for "teaching" is quite different from that used in ver. 19, and there wrongly translated. Instruction is the second necessary condition for discipleship. In the case of adults, as was said above, some teaching must precede the initiation; but this has to be supplemented subsequently in order to build up the convert in the faith and make him perfect; while infants must be taught "as soon as they are able to learn, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession they have here  made." All must be taught the Christian faith and duty, and how to obtain God's help to enable them to please him, and to continue in the way of salvation, so that they may "die from sin, and rise again unto righteousness; continually mortifying all their evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and godliness of living" ('Public Baptism of Infants'). "He gives," says St. Chrysostom, "the one charge with a view to doctrine [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the form of baptism], the other concerning commandments" ('Horn.,' 90.). All that Christ commanded, both in doctrine and morals, all that he had taught and enjoined during the three past years, they were henceforward to take as their textbook, and enforce on all who were admitted into the Church by baptism. As the Greek is, "I commanded," being aorist and not perfect, it may be rightly opined that Christ here alludes also to various details which he set forth and enjoined during these great forty days, between his resurrection and ascension, when he gave commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen, and spake to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God (<a href="../../par/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo.</span> "After that, because he had enjoined on them great things, to raise their courage, he <span class="accented">says.</span> Lo! "etc. (Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">I am with you alway</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Every word is emphatic. The Ascension was at hand; this implied an absence of his visible presence, to be replaced by a spiritual presence, more perfect, potent, effectual, infinite. It is I myself, I, God and Man,who am (not "will be") henceforward ever present among you, with you as Companion, Friend, Guide, Saviour, God. I am with you in all your ministrations, prayers public and private, baptisms, communions, exhortations, doctrine, discipline And this, not now and then, not at certain times only, but "all the days" of your pilgrimage, all the dark days of trial and persecution and affliction; all the days when you, my apostles, are gathered to your rest, and have committed your work to other hands; my presence shall never be withdrawn for a single moment. Often had God made an analogous promise to his servants under the old dispensation - to Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), to Joshua (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>), to Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>); but this spiritual presence of Christ is something unknown to previous history, a nearness unspeakable, in the Church at large and in the Christian's heart. <span class="cmt_word">Even unto the end of the world;</span> <span class="accented">the consummation of the age</span>, as <a href="../../par/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> (where see note). When the new era is ushered in, evangelizing work will cease; God shall be all in all; all shall know him from the least unto the greatest. And they shall ever be with the Lord; "wherefore comfort one another with these words" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Amen</span>. The word is here an interpolation, but it expresses what every pious reader must say in his heart, "So be it, O Lord; be with us unto the end; guide and strengthen us in life, and bring us safely through the valley of the shadow of death, to thy blessed presence, where is the fulness of joy forevermore!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/27.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 27"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 27" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../mark/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Mark 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Mark 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
