<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, they brought to him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). Bengel's remark, "<span class="accented">Offerebant -</span> Tales oblationes factae sunt Salvatori plurimae, gratae," though very beautiful, is, from its undue insistence on the sacrificial use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, hardly exegesis. Matthew omits the difficulty that was experienced in bringing him to our Lord (see parallel passages), yet this alone accounts for the special commendation of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">A man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed.</span> Probably a mat or quilt (ver. 6). Professor Marshall, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span> for March, 1891, p. 215, has a most interesting note showing that the differences between "lying on a bed" (Matthew)and "carried by four" (Mark), and even "they sought to bring him in, and to place him before him" (Luke, who has already mentioned "on a bed" ), may be explained by being different translations of an original Aramaic sentence. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus seeing their faith</span>. Including that of the paralytic, who, as we may gather from the obedience he afterwards shows, had agreed to and had encouraged the special efforts of his bearers. <span class="cmt_word">Said unto the sick of the palsy; Son,</span> <span class="cmt_word">be of good cheer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Son.</span> So Mark, but Luke has "man" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>), which, though more usual in Greek (though still Hebraic, for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span> would have been in accordance with classical usage), is much more colourless. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as a term of address, is elsewhere in the New Testament used only where there is relationship physical (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-48.htm">Luke 2:48</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/15-31.htm">Luke 15:31</a>; even Luke 16:25) or moral, especially that of pupil and teacher (<a href="../../par/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; cf <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>). It therefore implies that there is both sympathy and much common ground between the speaker and him whom he addresses. It is the antithesis of <a href="../../par/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> (cf. further, <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 22). Thus it here served affectionately to encourage the sufferer in soul and body, preparing him to receive the announcement following. Matthew emphasizes its purpose by prefixing <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thy sins be</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">are</span>; expressing clearly that the words are the statement of a fact, not merely the expression of a command.  <span class="cmt_word">Forgiven thee</span>; Revised Version omits "thee" (genuine in Luke), with <span class="accented">manuscripts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Matthew and Mark use the present of general statement, Luke the perfect (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Doric; Winer, 14:3. a), to express a past fact of permanent significance. Observe the order of the Lord's assurance, as recorded in the true text. Courage, sympathy, forgiveness, and, only after all else, recalling individual sins. As the assurance of forgiveness is delightful to the soul, so is it often helpful to the body. Hence possibly our Lord's method in this case, for the man "inter spem metumque dubius pendebat" (Wetstein). Compare for the conjunction of the two, <a href="../../par/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>, and, as a still closer parallel to our passage, Talm. Bab., 'Nedarim,' 41<span class="accented">a</span>. "R. Hija bar Abba said, The sick doth not recover from his sickness until all his sins be forgiven him, for it is said, 'Who pardoneth all thy iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.'" So also Qimbi (on <a href="../../par/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5</a>, "Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee" ): "He does not say, Heal my body," for it is his sins that are the cause of his sickness, but if God heal his soul from its sickness, viz. by making atonement for his sins, then his body is healed."

From St. Luke's account (ver. 17) we learn that the miracle took place before a large assembly of "Pharisees and teachers of the Law, who had come out of every village of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem."

"No passage of the Old Testament affirms that the Messiah himself will forgive sins.

Observe that Mark lays more stress upon the process of their thoughts, Matthew and Luke on the conclusion at which they arrived, Luke also indicating that the supposed sin had many parts (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) - they thought, "Every word he has uttered is blasphemy."

Further, if, as seems likely,. the phrase was understood to symbolize the nation, he desired them to see in himself the great means whereby the nation should rise to its ideal. If, as is possible, though hardly probable, this saying of our Lord's is chronologically earlier than <a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and there,-fore the earliest occasion on which he used the phrase, the almost direct reference to <a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> makes it the more interesting. <span class="cmt_word">(Then saith he to the sick of the palsy). </span> The thought of the sentence is continued, but as he now turns directly to the sick man, its form is altered. <span class="cmt_word">Arise, take up</span>.

At the present day in Palestine" a booth of branches, or a more substantial hut, is erected at every entrance into the city or village, and there, both day and night, sits a man at ' the receipt of custom.' He taxes all the produce, piercing with a long, sharp iron rod the large camel-bags of wheat or cotton, in order to discover concealed copper wire, or other contraband" (Van Lennep, in Exell, <span class="accented">in lot.</span>). Schurer (1. 2. p, 67) shows that the customs raised at Capernaum in the time of Christ undoubtedly went, not into the imperial <span class="accented">fiscus</span>, but into the treasury of Herod Antipas. On the other band, in Judaea at that time the customs were raised in the interests of the imperial <span class="accented">fiscus.</span> (On "publicans" generally, see ch. 5:46, note; and for further details, Edersheim, 'Life,' 1. 515.) <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Follow me</span>.

There the fact that they were scribes, accustomed to weigh the statements of the Law about blasphemy, etc., was prominent in the mind of the narrator; here it is rather the fact that they were Pharisees, men who by their very name professed to hold aloof from those who neglected the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Saw it</span>.

Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 4. p. 222) explains the variants "teacher" (here) and "drink" (parallel passages) by the original Aramaic word for "drink" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) having been written here with the peculiar spelling of the Samaritan Targum (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">With</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">publicans and sinners?</span> Who form but one class (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>).

In the original connexion of this quotation (<a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>) the words are without doubt (but cf. Dr. Taylor's 'Gospel in the Law,' p. 10) an expression of God's desire that his people should show mercy rather than only perform external sacrifices, and this meaning is probably intended by our Lord here also. The connexion will then be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">I</span> wish you to show mercy rather than perform external actions, for only thus will you resemble me in my coming to call sinners;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "I wish you to show this mercy, and therefore I practise it myself." The former seems the more natural. It is, however, possible that our Lord disregards the original context of the words, and uses them only as a summary of an important truth, that God prefers to show mercy rather than to insist on sacrifice. This would make excellent sense here, viz. "Learn the true principle by which God acts, free grace, for it is on this that I have acted in coming to call sinners." (So nearly Dr. Taylor, op. c<span class="accented">it.</span>, p. 3.)

Observe that of the three accounts St. Matthew's points out the most clearly that the objection originated with the disciples of John the Baptist.

So also St. John thought it desirable to recall the teaching of the Master, that while he himself was the Bridegroom, the Baptist was only subordinate (<a href="../../par/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>).

From a consideration of these details, the conclusion seems inevitable that we have, in fact, narratives of two distinct occurrences, but it is quite consistent with tiffs conclusion to suppose that during the oral transmission of the narratives a certain amount of assimilation took place. Upon this supposition, it further appears probable that, as the narrative in ch. 20. was the better known, for it was in the Petrine cycle, our narrative became assimilated to it rather than the reverse. On the other hand, the number recorded in ch. 20. (not Mark or Luke) looks much like an assimilation to that of our incident (cf. the notes on the section <a href="../../par/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28-34</a>, ver. 31, and the section vers. 32-34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus departed thence.</span> As he was passing along on his way <span class="accented">thence</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the house of Jairus, if the context be pressed.

"They brought to him one possessed with a devil, dumb, and the [dumb spake]. And the multitudes [said.]... But the Pharisees, He casteth out the devils by... the prince of the devils." One explanation is that the two narratives are taken kern different sources, but represent the same incident; another, that as in vers. 27-31, so also here, the narratives of two similar incidents have become assimilated. At any rate, in the case of ver. 34 there has probably been assimilation, and that since the writing of the Gospel. For: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ver. 34 is wanting in D, the Old Latin manuscripts <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">k</span>, Hilary and Juvencns, and is therefore rightly bracketed by Westcott and Hort as perhaps "<span class="accented">a</span> Western non-interpolation" (2. &sect; 240). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The verse seems to be hardly in complete accordance with the aim of the whole section, which ends much more suitably with the effect on the multitudes. In <a href="../../par/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a> the verse forms a climax (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2, 10, 14</a>). But here there has been no opposition mentioned since the very beginning of the chapter (for the disobedience of the blind men cannot be so called), so that the monstrous accusation comes in quite unexpectedly. Observe that this is not a case in which subjective difficulties are in themselves a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> argument for the genuineness of a phrase, for the early copyists troubled themselves very little about questions of the internal arrangement and the general aim of the sections. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">-</span> (<span class="accented">And</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">as they went out</span> (<span class="accented">forth</span>, Revised Version; ver. 31).

If the verse be genuine here, the thought, of course, is that the only effect of Christ's miracles upon the Pharisees was to drive them to open blasphemy and wanton opposition to the evidence of plain facts, as is brought out at length in <a href="../../par/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24-32</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils</span>; <span class="accented">by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils</span> (Revised Version); which indicates the true order of the words in the Greek. <span class="accented">Through.</span> The Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">in</span>, is more literal.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a> (<a href="../../par/luke/13-22.htm">Luke 13:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus went about all the cities and</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">villages</span>.

Its omission here and the alteration of the words," in all Galilee," to "all the cities and the villages," are both due to the wider scope of what follows. Observe that in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a> our Lord's circuit is the occasion of crowds resorting to him, and serves as an introduction to a full account of his personal teaching, while here it is the occasion of his sending representatives, and serves as an introduction to his commission to them. As to the phrase, "healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness," notice that the recurrence of terminology (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>) falls in with the oral theory, especially in its catechetical form (cf.

But while serving there as an introduction to the rest of the speech, the reason for it is so much more self-evident here that St. Matthew seems to have recorded it in its original connexion. Our Lord himself, feeling the shepherdless condition of the people, desires to call out the interest of his disciples in it. He wants them to realize both the need of the people and the possibility that lay before the workmen.
