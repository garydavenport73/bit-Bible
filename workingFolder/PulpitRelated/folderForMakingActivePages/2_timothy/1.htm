The idea broached by some commentators, that this variation in expression marks some change in St. Paul's confidence in Timothy, seems utterly unfounded. The exhortations to boldness and courage which follow were the natural results of the danger in which St. Paul's own life was, and the depression of spirits caused by the desertion of many friends (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10-16</a>). St. Paul, too, knew that the time was close at hand when Timothy, still young, would no longer have him to lean upon and look up to, and therefore would prepare him for it; and possibly he may have seen some symptoms of weakness in Timothy's character, which made him anxious, as appears, indeed, in the course of this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Grace</span>, etc. (so <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>, A.V.; 2 John 3). Jude has "mercy, peace, and love." The salutation in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a> is "grace and peace," as also in <a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>, and elsewhere in St. Paul's Epistles, and in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>.

For what does the apostle give thanks to God? The answer to this question will give the clue to the explanation. The only thing mentioned in the context which seer, s a proper subject of thanksgiving is that which is named in ver. 5, viz. the "unfeigned faith" that was in Timothy. That this was a proper subject of thanksgiving we learn from <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>, where St. Paul writes that, having heard of their faith in the Lord Jesus, he ceased not to give thanks for then-J, making mention of them in his prayers (see, too, <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). Assuming, then, that this was the subject of his thanksgiving, we notice especially the reading of the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "having received," and the note of Bengel that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means to be reminded of any one by another, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is used when any one comes to your recollection without external prompting; both which fall in with our previous conclusion. And we get for the main sentence the satisfactory meaning: "I give thanks to God that I have received (or, because I have received) a most pleasant reminder (from some letter or visitor to which he does not further allude) of your unfeigned faith," etc, The main sentence clearly is: "I thank God... having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee." The intermediate words are, in Paul's manner, parenthetical and explanatory. Being about to say that it was at some special remembrance of Timothy's faith that he gave thanks, the thought arose in his mind that there was a continual remembrance of him day and night in his prayers; that he was ever thinking of him, longing to see him, and to have the tears shed at their parting turned into joy at their meeting again. And so he interposes this thought, and prefaces it with <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> - not  surely, "how," as in the R.V., but in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, "as," "just as." And so the whole passage comes out: "Just <span class="accented">as</span> I have an unceasing remembrance of you in my prayers, day and night, longing to see you, that the tears which I remember you shed at our parting may be turned into joy, <span class="accented">so</span> do I give special thanks to God on the remembrance of your faith."

It is hardly a real word, and has no place in Stephens' 'Thes.,' except incidentally by comparison with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>. It has, however, a classical usage. The proper word for a "grandmother" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Lois</span>; a name not found elsewhere, possibly meaning "good," or "excellent," from the same root as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x1f77;&#x27;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This and the following Eunice are examples of the frequent use of Greek or Latin names by Jews. Eunice, we know from <a href="../../par/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>, was a Jewess and a Christian, as it would seem her mother Lois was before her.

In both passages it is contrasted with a previous state of despondency (<a href="../../par/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26</a>) or fear (1 Macc. 13:2). We must, therefore, conclude that St. Paul knew Timothy to be cast down and depressed by his own imprisonment and imminent danger, and therefore exhorted him to revive . 'the spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind," which was given him at his ordination. The metaphor is taken from kindling slumbering ashes into a flame by the bellows, and the force of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is to show that the embers had gone down from a previous state of candescence or frame - "to rekindle, light up again."

The laying on of hands was also the medium through which the Holy Ghost was given in Confirmation (<a href="../../par/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>), and in healing (<a href="../../par/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18, 23</a>).

It seems certain, therefore, that St. Paul thought that Timothy's gentle spirit was in danger of being cowed by the adversaries of the gospel. The whole tenor of his exhortation, combined as it was with words of warm affection, is in harmony with this thought. Compare with the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Of power and love.</span> Power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is emphatically the attribute of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>, etc.), and that which he specially imparts to the servants of Christ (<a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-8.htm">Acts 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>, etc.).

"Discipline" is not a very happy rendering, though it gives the meaning; "correction," or "sound instruction," is perhaps nearer. It would seem that Timothy had shown some signs of weakness, and had not boldly reproved and instructed in their duty certain offenders, as true love for souls required him to do. The phrase from Plutarch's 'Life of Cato,' quoted by Alford, exactly gives the force of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "For the amendment and correction of the rest."

For a full description of the abolition of death and the introduction of eternal life in its stead, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, see <a href="../../par/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>. and 6, and especially Romans 6:8-11. Through the gospel; because the gospel both declares the death and resurrection of Christ, and calls us to share in them. These mighty glories of the gospel were good reasons why Timothy should not be ashamed of the testimony of his Lord, nor shrink from the afflictions of the gospel. They were signal evidences of the power of God.

This he expresses in a metaphor drawn from the common action of one person entrusting another with some precious deposit, to be kept for a time and restored whole and uninjured. All the words in the sentence are part of this metaphor. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> must be taken in the sense of "entrusting" (<span class="accented">curae ac fidei alicujus committo</span>), as <a href="../../par/luke/16-11.htm">Luke 16:11</a>. So <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "to be entrusted with the gospel" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I am entrusted with a dispensation" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>; see Wisd. 14:5, etc.). And so in classical Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "to entrust something to another" to take care of for you. Here, then, St. Paul says (not as in the R.V., "I know him whom I have believed," which is quite inadmissible, but), "I know whom I have trusted [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in whom I have placed confidence, and to whom I have committed the keeping of my deposit], and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) unto that day." The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> is the thing which Paul entrusted to his faithful guardian, one who he knew would never betray the trust, but would restore it to him safe and sound at the day of Christ. What the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> was may be difficult to express in any one word, but it comprised himself, his life, his whole treasure, his salvation, his joy, his eternal happiness - all for the sake of which he risked life and limb in this world, content to lose sight of them for a while, knowing that he should receive them all from the hands of God in the day of Christ. All thus hangs perfectly together. There can be no reasonable doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> means, "my deposit" - that which I have deposited with him. Neither is there the slightest difficulty in the different applications of the same metaphor in ver. 14 and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>. For it is as true that God entrusts to his faithful servants the deposit of the faith, to be kept by them with jealous fidelity, as it is that his servants entrust to him the keeping of their souls, as knowing him to be faithful.

It may, however, well be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> here is used in even as strong a sense as in the other two passages, inasmuch as here it follows instead of preceding the substantive (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The pattern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a> (where see note), where it manifestly means a "pattern," not a "form."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">That are</span> for <span class="accented">they which are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">turned</span> for <span class="accented">be turned</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Phygelus</span> for <span class="accented">Phygellus</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Turned away from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>). This verb is used, as here, governing an accusative of the person or thing turned away from, in <a href="../../par/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>, as frequently in classical Greek. The use of the aorist here is important, as St. Paul does not mean to say that the Churches of Asia had all forsaken him, which was not true, and which it would be absurd to inform Timothy of if it were true, living as he was at Ephesus, the central city of Asia, but adverts to some occasion, probably connected with his trim before Nero, when they shrank from him in a cowardly way. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> means "the whole party in Asia" connected with the  particular transaction to which St. Paul is alluding, and which was known to Timothy though it is not known to us. Perhaps he had applied to certain Asiatics, whether Christians or Jews or GraecoRomans, for a testimony to his orderly conduct in Asia, and they had refused it; or they may have been at Rome at the time, and avoided St. Paul; and among them Phygelus and Hermogenes, whose conduct may have been particularly ungrateful and unexpected. Nothing is known of either of them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Grant</span> for <span class="accented">give</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Grant mercy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This connection of the words is only found here. <span class="cmt_word">The house of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Onesiphorus</span>. It is inferred from this expression, coupled with that in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, that Onesiphorus himself was no longer living; and hence ver. 18 (where see note) is thought by some to be an argument for prayers for the dead. The inference, further strengthened by the peculiar language of ver. 18, though not absolutely certain, is undoubtedly probable. The connection between this and the preceding verse is the contrast between the conduct of Phygelus and Hermogenes and that of Onesiphorus. They repudiated all acquaintance with the apostle in his day of trial; he, when he was in Rome, diligently sought him and with difficulty found him. and oft refreshed him with Christian sympathy and communion, acting with no less courage than love. He was no longer on earth to receive a prophet's reward (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>), but St. Paul prays that he may receive it in the day of Christ, and that meanwhile God may requite to his family the mercy he had showed to St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Refreshed me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">revived me</span>.

(<span class="cmt_word">The Lord grant unto him</span>). The parenthesis seems only to be required on the supposition that the words <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>., are a kind of play on the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of the preceding verse. Otherwise it is better to take the words as a new sentence. The repetition of "the Lord" is remarkable, but nothing seems to hang upon it. The second <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> seems to suppose the Lord sitting on the judgment throne. As regards the amount of encouragement given by this passage to prayers for the dead (supposing Onesiphorus to have been dead), the mere expression of a pious wish or hope that he may find mercy is a very slender foundation on which to build the superstructure of prayer and Masses for the deliverance of souls from purgatory. <span class="cmt_word">In how many things,</span> etc. St. Paul does not say, as the A.V. makes him say, that Onesiphorus "ministered unto him" at Ephesus. It may have been so, but the words do not necessarily mean this. "What good service he did at Ephesus" would faithfully represent the Greek words; and this might describe great exertions made by Onesiphorus after his return from Rome to procure the apostle's acquittal and release by the intercession of the principal persons at Ephesus. This would, of course, be known to Timothy. It may, however, describe the ministerial labours and services of Onesiphorus at Ephesus after his return from Rome, or it may refer to former ministrations when Paul and Timothy were at Ephesus together (see Introduction). There seem to be no materials for arriving at absolute certainty on the point. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_timothy/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Timothy 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Timothy 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_timothy/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Timothy 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Timothy 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
