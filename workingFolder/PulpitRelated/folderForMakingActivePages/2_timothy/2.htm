The strength, Timothy is reminded, by which he was to fight the good fight, was not his own, but that which would come to him from the grace and love of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Which</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The things which thou hast heard,</span> etc. Here we have distinctly enunciated the succession of apostolical doctrine through apostolical men. We have also set before us the partnership of the presbyterate, and, in a secondary degree, of the whole Church, with the apostles and bishops their successors, in preserving pure and unadulterated the faith once delivered to the saints. There can be little doubt that St. Paul is here alluding to Timothy's ordination, as in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6, 7, 13, 14</a>. Timothy had then heard from the apostle's lips a certain "form of sound words" - something in the nature of a creed, some summary of gospel truth, which was the deposit placed in his charge; and in committing it to him, he and the presbyters present had laid their hands on him, and the whole Church had assented, and confirmed the same. "Thus through many witnesses," whose presence and assent, like that of witnesses to the execution of a deed of transfer of land (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10, 16, 18</a>), was necessary to make the transaction valid and complete, had Timothy received his commission to preach the Word of God; and what he had received he was to hand on in like manner to faithful men, who should be able to teach the same to others also. <span class="cmt_word">Commit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); identifying the doctrine committed to be handed on with the <span class="accented">deposit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>) of <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-14.htm">2 Timothy 1:14</a>. It is important to note here both the concurrence of the presbyters and the assent of the Church. The Church has ever been averse to private ordinations, and has ever associated the people as consentient parties in ordination (Thirty-first Canon; Preface to "Form and Manner of Making of Deacons," and rubric at close - "in the face of the Church;" "Form and Manner of Ordering of Priests" - "Good people," etc.).

The great lesson here taught is that the warfare of the Christian soldier requires the same concentration of purpose as that of the earthly warrior, if he would win the victory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-5.htm">2 Timothy 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">And if a man also strive for masteries, <i>yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Also a man</span> for <span class="accented">a man also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">contend in the games</span> for <span class="accented">strive for masteries</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he is not</span> for <span class="accented">yet is he not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have contended</span> for <span class="accented">strive</span>, A.V.

It means "to contend for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> the prize, to be an "athlete." This is also the meaning of the A.V. "strive for masteries." "To strive," means properly to contend with an antagonist, and "mastery" is an old English word for "superiority," "victory," or the like. Dryden has "mastership" in the same sense - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When noble youths for mastership should strive,<br />To quoit, to run, and steeds and chariots drive."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Ovid., 'Met,' bk. 1.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Lawfully</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, as <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-8.htm">1 Timothy 1:8</a>); according to the laws and usages of the games. So Timothy must conform to the laws of the Christian warfare, and not shrink from afflictions, if he would gain the great Christian prize.

The</span> apostle's lessons had been given in parables or similitudes. He therefore begs Timothy to note them well, lest the application to himself should escape him, suggesting further that he should seek the necessary wisdom and understanding from God. So our Lord, at the end of the parables recorded in <a href="../../par/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, says to his disciples in ver. 51, "Have ye understood all these things?" and elsewhere, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." <span class="cmt_word">Understanding</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); one of the special gifts of the Spirit (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, LXX.; see <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>).

Remember Jesus Christ. The A.V. seems to give the sense more correctly than the R.V. The point of the exhortation is to remember that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead, and by that remembrance to be encouraged to face even death courageously. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament, usually governs the genitive case as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>. But in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>, it has an accusative, as here, and commonly in classical Greek. There seems to be hardly sufficient ground for the distinction mentioned by Bishop Ellicott, that with a genitive it means simply "remember," with the accusative "keep in remembrance." It is more difficult to determine the exact force and intent of the clause, "of the seed of David." It seems, however, to point to Christ's human nature, so as to make the example of Christ's resurrection apposite as an encouragement to Timothy. And this view is much strengthened by <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, where the addition, "according to the flesh," as contrasted with "the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness," marks the clause, "of the seed of David," as specially pointing to the human nature of Christ. The particular form which the reference takes probably arises from the form to which the apostle refers us as "my gospel." In that creed, which was the epitome of the gospel as preached by St. Paul, there was no doubt mention made of Christ's Davidic descent. Others, as Huther, think the clause points to the Messianic dignity of David. Others that it is inserted in refutation of the Docetae, and to show the reality of the death and resurrection of Christ; or that it is meant to mark especially the fulfilment of prophecy. But the first explanation is quite satisfactory, and the general purpose of the reference to our Lord as intended to encourage Timothy to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, is fully borne out by the "faithful saying" in vers. 11 and 12, "If we died with him, we shall also live with him: if we endure, we shall also reign with him."

While I am here, shut up in prison, the Word of God, preached by a thousand tongues, is giving life and liberty to myriads of my brethren of the human race. The tyrant can silence my voice and confine it within the walls of my dungeon; but all the while the sound of the gospel is going through all the earth, its saving words to the ends of the world; and I therein rejoice, yea, and will rejoice; and not all the lemons of Rome can take this joy from me."

The first part of the verse is indeed equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>, but there is nothing to answer to the second part. The passages quoted by commentators from <a href="../../par/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11</a> are far too general to indicate any particular reference. Possibly the motto is one of those "faithful sayings" before referred to. The two inscriptions, taken together, show the two sides of the Christian standing - God's election, and man's holiness (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7, 8</a>).

The object of the figure of the various vessels in the "great house" is to show that, though every one that names the Name of the Lord <span class="accented">ought</span> to depart from unrighteousness, yet we must not be surprised if it is not so, and if there are found in the Church some professing Christians whose practice is quite inconsistent with their profession.

It is hardly natural to imply that one vessel in the house will become a golden vessel by purging itself from the wooden and earthen vessels.

But there is no real difficulty in referring <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to the same person as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (meaning in both cases the devil), as in the passage from Plato's 'Cratylus,' cited by Huther, after De Wette, the cause of the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> being that St. Paul was at the moment emphasizing the fact of these captives being deprived of their own will, and made subservient to the will of another. The passage may be paraphrased: "If peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, so as to recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, after they had been led captive by him, so as to be no longer their own masters, but obliged to do his will."  The implied contrast is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, just as in the passage from the 'Cratylus,' p. 430 (vol. 4. p. 306, Bekker's edit.), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The full passage is <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Another example of the transition from <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is in <a href="../../par/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>, where there is a contrast between John as the witness and Christ as the true Light (compare, too, <a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has the force of "not you, but he"). For the general turn of phrase, comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>, "Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ," where <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) corresponds to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It should be noted further that the sentence is certainly rather a peculiar one, from the use of such uncommon words as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, and the mixture of metaphors. But the sense of the A.V. is fully borne out. The interpretation preferred by Bishop Ellicott is "they may recover themselves from the snare of the devil unto his will (viz. God's), having (previously) been led captive by him (viz. the devil)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_timothy/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Timothy 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Timothy 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_timothy/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Timothy 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Timothy 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
