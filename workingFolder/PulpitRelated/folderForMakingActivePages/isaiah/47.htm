The song divides itself into four strophes, or stanzas - the first one of four verses (vers. 1-4); the second of three (vers. 5-7); the third of four (Vers. 8-11); and the fourth also of four (vers. 12-15). The speaker is either Jehovah (see ver. 3, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>) or "a chorus of celestial beings" (Cheyne), bent on expressing their sympathy with Israel <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">Come down, and sit in the dust;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "descend to the lowest depth of humiliation" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a> and <a href="../../par/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a><span class="cmt_word">). O virgin daughter of Babylon</span>. The "virgin daughter of Babylon" is the Babylonian <span class="accented">people</span> as distinct from the city (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>). "Virgin" does not mean "unconquered;" for Babylon had been taken by the Assyrians some half-dozen times ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, pp. 58, 130, 149, 157, 164, 175, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sit on the ground</span>: there is no throne; rather, <span class="accented">sit on the ground throneless</span>, or <span class="accented">without a throne.</span> Hitherto the "virgin daughter" had sat, as it were, on a throne, ruling the nations. Now she must sit on the ground - there was no throne left for her. It is the fact that Babylon was never, after her capture by Cyrus, the capital. of a kingdom. Under the Achsemenian kings she was the residence of the court for a part of the year; but Susa was the capital. Under Alexander she was designated for his capital; but he died before his designs could be carried out. Under the Seleucidae she rapidly dwindled in consequence, until she became a ruin.   <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be called tender and</span> <span class="cmt_word">delicate;</span> or, <span class="accented">delicate and luxurious</span> (Cheyne). Babylon had hitherto been one of the chief seats of Oriental luxury. She was "the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>), "the golden city" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>). She was given to revelry and feasting, to mirth and drunkenness, to a shameless licensed debauchery (Herod., 1. 199; Baruch 6:43). All this would now be changed. Her population would have to perform the hard duties laid upon them by foreign masters. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a></div><div class="verse">Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take the millstones, and grind meal</span>. Do the hard work commonly allotted to female slaves. Turn the heavy upper millstone all day long upon the nether one (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>). Babylon having been personified as a <span class="accented">female</span> captive, the details have to be in unison. Uncover thy locks. Babylonian women are represented in the Assyrian sculptures as wearing closefitting caps upon their heads (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, p. 500). <span class="cmt_word">Make bare the leg...  pass over the rivers</span>. On the way from their own city to the land of their captivity, they would have to wade through streams, and in so doing to expose parts of their persons which delicacy required to be concealed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet <i>thee as</i> a man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not meet thee as a man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">shall not meet a man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I shall not find any one to oppose me."

It is certainly quite unlike anything else in the song, which would artistically be improved by its removal. If, however, it be retained, we must regard it as a parenthetic ejaculation of the Jewish Church on hearing the first strophe of the song - the Church contrasting itself with Babylon, which has no one to stand up for it, whereas it has as "Redeemer the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a></div><div class="verse">Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness</span>. The second strophe begins, like the first, with a double imperative. The fallen people is recommended to hide its shame in silence and darkness, as disgraced persons do who shrink from being seen by their fellows. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be called The lady of kingdoms.</span> Babylon can scarcely have borne this title in Isaiah's time, or at any earlier period, unless it were a <span class="accented">very</span> remote one. She had been secondary to Assyria for at least six hundred years when Isaiah wrote, and under Sennacherib was ruled by viceroys of his appointment. But Isaiah's prophetic foresight enables him to realize the later period of Babylon's prosperity and glory under Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar, when she became the inheritress of the greatness of Assyria, and exercised rule over a large portion of Western Asia. Nebuchadnezzar was, no doubt, as he is called by both Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a>) and Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37</a>), a "king of kings;" and Babylon was then an empress-state, exercising authority over many minor kingdoms. It is clear that, both in the earlier and the later chapters, the prophet realizes this condition of things (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4-6, 12-17</a>; as well as the present passage). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a></div><div class="verse">I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was wroth with my people</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have polluted...  and given</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I polluted and gave.</span> The reference is to the conquest of Judaea by Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst show them no mercy.</span> We have very little <span class="accented">historical</span> knowledge of the general treatment of the Jewish exiles during the Captivity. A certain small number - Daniel and the Three Children - were advanced to positions of importance (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48, 49</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/3-30.htm">Daniel 3:30</a>), and, on the whole, well treated. On the other hand, Jehoiachin underwent an imprisonment of thirty-seven years' duration (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Mr. Cheyne says that "the writings of Jeremiah and Ezekiel do not suggest that the [bulk of the] exiles were great sufferers." This is, no doubt, true; and we may, perhaps, regard Isaiah's words in this place as sufficiently made good by the "cruelties which disfigured the first days of the Babylonian triumph" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/5-12.htm">Lamentations 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). Still, there may well have been a large amount of suffering among the rank-and-file of the captives, of which no historic record has come down to us. <a href="../../par/psalms/138.htm">Psalm 138</a>. reveals some of the bitter feelings of the exiles. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the ancient</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon the aged.</span> The author of Chronicles notes that Nebuchadnezzar, on taking Jerusalem, "had no compassion on young man or maiden, old man or him that stooped for age" (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). There is no reason for giving the words of the present passage an allegorical meaning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a></div><div class="verse">And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: <i>so</i> that thou didst not lay these <i>things</i> to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever</span>. The idea of "continuance" is one of the primary instincts of human nature. Hence we regard it as certain that the sun will rise on the morrow. We expect things to "continue in one stay," and "to-morrow to be as to-day," if not even "more abundant." Babylon was not much more arrogant than other nations when she assumed that silo would be "a lady for ever." And she had more excuse than almost any other nation. Her capital was one of the most ancient cities, if not the most ancient city in the world (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> ).   Though not unconquered (see the comment on ver. 1), she had yet for two millennia or more maintained a prominent position among the chief peoples of the earth, and had finally risen to a prouder eminence than any that she had previously occupied. Still, she ought to have remembered that "all things come to an end," and to have so comported herself in the time of her prosperity as not to have provoked God to anger. <span class="cmt_word">So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart</span>. "These things" must refer to the calamities about to fall upon Babylon, of which she may have heard before the end came - since they had been prophesied so long previously - but which she did not take to heart. <span class="cmt_word">The latter end of it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the probable issue of her pride and cruelty" (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore hear now this, <i>thou that art</i> given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I <i>am</i>, and none else beside me; I shall not sit <i>as</i> a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and now.</span> The third strophe begins here, but with a single, instead of a double, imperative.

Herodotus says that, when Cyrus invested the city, the inhabitants "made light of his siege" (1:190), and occupied themselves "in dancing and revelry" (1:191). The Nabonidus Tablet seems to show that very slight and insufficient preparations for defence were made.! am, and none else <span class="cmt_word">Beside me.</span> This is not self-deification, but only a boast of superiority to all other earthly powers. Zephaniah expresses in exactly similar terms the pride and arrogance of Assyria (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>). I shall not sit as a widow; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in solitude and desolation (<a href="../../par/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>), deserted by the crowds who had sought her marts and delighted in her luxury.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a></div><div class="verse">But these two <i>things</i> shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, <i>and</i> for the great abundance of thine enchantments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a moment in one day</span>. The day of the capture of the city by Cyrus, which was the third of Marchesvan,  <span class="date">B.C. 539</span>. Then, "in a moment," Babylon lost the whole of her prestige, ceased to reign, ceased to be an independent power, became a "widow," had a portion of her population turn from her, was brought down to the dust. Loss of children, and widowhood came upon her in their perfection<span class="cmt_word">;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. "</span>in the full extent of their bitterness" (Cheyne). Not that Cyrus imitated her common practice by carrying off her entire population; on the contrary, she continued for more than two centuries to be a flourishing and populous town. Twice she revolted from Darius Hystaspis ('Beh. Ins.,' col. 1. par. 16; col 3, par. 13), once, perhaps, from Xerxes (Ctes., 'Ext. Pers,' &sect; 22). Alexander the Great found her walls and her great buildings in ruins, but still she was a considerable place. Cyrus, however, no doubt, carried off a portion of her population, which thenceforth begun to dwindle, and continually became less and less as time went on, until she sank into a solitude. That extreme desolation which the prophets paint in such vivid colours (<a href="../../par/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>:19-22; 14:22, 23; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-10.htm">Jeremiah 50:10</a>:15, 38-40; 2:36-43) was potentially contained in the capture by Cyrus, which was the work of a single day. <span class="cmt_word">For the multitude of thy sorceries...  of thine enchantments</span> (comp. ver. 13; and see also <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>). The word here translated "sorceries" probably means "incantations" or "enchantments," while that translated "enchantments" means "spells." The addiction of the Babylonians to marc is largely attested by the classical writers, and has been proved beyond a doubt by the lately discovered native remains. By these it appears that their magic fell under three principal heads: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the preparation and use of spells and talismans, which were written forms engraved on stone or impressed on clay, and worn on the person or attached to the object on which their influence was to be exerted; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the composition and recitation of formulae of incantation, which were supposed to act as charms, and to drive away demons and diseases; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the taking of observations and framing of tables of prognostics and of omens for general use, together with the casting of horoscopes for the special advantage of individuals (see Rawlinson's 'Egypt and Babylon,' p. 58; and comp. Lenor, mant,'La Magic chez les Chaldaens,' and Professor Sayce's papers in the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 3:p. 145, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>; vol. 4:p. 302, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>). The first and second forms of marc are glanced at in the present passage; the third is noticed in ver. 13.

Procl., 'In Tim.,' p. 71; Phoenix Coloph. ap. Athen., 'Deipnos.,' 12:p. 530, E.; Diod. Sic., 2 31, etc.), led them on to that perversion of true science, astrology, which, when once entered upon, seduces the mind from all genuine and fruitful study of the celestial phenomena, and leads it into a labyrinth of absurdities.   It also puffed them up, and made them regard themselves as altogether superior to other nations (see the comment on ver. 8, <span class="accented">sub fin.</span>).

Connect this with the first clause of ver. 10, "Thou hast trusted in thine own evil (moral), therefore shall evil (physical) fall upon thee." The same word, <span class="accented">ra'ah</span>, is used in both places. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not know from whence it riseth</span>. So the Vulgate, Vitringa, Gesenius, and Dr. Kay. But the bulk of modern commentators (Hitzig, Ewald, Delitzsch, Nagelsbach, Weir, Cheyne) render, "Thou wilt not know <span class="accented">how to charm it away."</span> Both meanings are possible, and are almost equally good; but the parallelism of the clauses is in favour of the latter rendering. <span class="accented">Shakhrah</span> should correspond in construction, as in sound, with <span class="accented">kapp'rah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To put it</span> <span class="cmt_word">off;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to expiate</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to get rid of it by means of expiatory rites. <span class="cmt_word">Which thou shalt not know;</span> or, <span class="accented">of which thou shalt not be aware.</span> (On the carelessness and want of foresight displayed by the Babylonians, see the comment on ver. 8.)

The irony is, however, confined to the first half (vers. 12, 13); giving place in vers. 14 and 15 to a scathing sentence of judgment and ruin. <span class="cmt_word">Enchantments...  sorceries;</span> rather, <span class="accented">spells</span>, <span class="accented">enchantments</span> (see the comment on ver. 9).

Those at the head of affairs had consulted the diviners of all classes, till they were utterly weary of so doing (compare the "<span class="accented">consultations"</span> of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar with such persons, <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2-11</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7, 8</a>). Yet let one further effort be made. <span class="cmt_word">Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up</span>. These are scarcely three classes of persons, but rather the same class under three designations: "astrologers" (literally, "dividers of the heavens"); "star-gazers," or observers of the <span class="accented">stars</span>; and "monthly <span class="accented">prognosticators</span>," or almanack-makers. The astronomy of the Babylonians consisted primarily in "dividing the heavens" into "houses," or constellations, and thus mapping them out in such a way that the infinite multiplicity, which at first baffles the beholder, might be grasped, reduced to order, and brought within the sphere of distinct cognizance. This work was an eminently useful one, and maintains its place in astronomy to the present day ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, p. 573). After the heavens were mapped out, and the courses of the sun and moon through the "houses" laid down, "<span class="accented">star-gazers"</span> directed their attention mainly to sun, moon, and planets, noting eclipses, occultations, conjunctions, and the like. All this was legitimate science; but, finally, the greater part of the astronomers launched into astrology, and undertook to prognosticate events from the changing phenomena of the heavens. Almanacks were put forth, in which predictions were made, either specially for a particular year, or generally for all time, based upon astronomical considerations; and on these great dependence was placed. (For a specimen of such an almanack, see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 158-161.)

A</span> return to the sarcastic tone of vers. 12, 13. The conflagration which spreads around is something more than a fire to warm one's self at - it is an awful widespread devastation.

It was carried on both by land and sea, and was very extensive, including both a large import and a large export trade. Her merchants were, in part natives, in part foreigners. It is the latter who are here specially intended. Seeing the gradual closing in upon Babylon of the Persian armies, and anticipating the worst, they fly in haste from the doomed city, each one making for his own country, and having no thought of interposing to save the people which have so long encouraged and protected them. Probably the greater number of these foreign merchants were either Phoenicians or Arabians. They shall wander every one to his quarter. Not his own quarter of the town, but his own quarter of the earth; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his own country (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>, "They shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land."). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/46.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 46"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 46" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/48.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 48"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 48" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
