He did as they had done (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-22.htm">Isaiah 36:22</a>; see the comment on that verse). But he went further, showing a deeper sense of horror and affliction than the officials had shown by being covered with sackcloth (on the combination of the two modes of showing grief or horror, see <a href="../../par/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>, etc<span class="cmt_word">.).

Hezekiah can, on this occasion, have gone up to the house of the Lord only to pray.

The prophets, as representatives of Jehovah, were entitled to respect and observance even from kings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day <i>is</i> a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and <i>there is</i> not strength to bring forth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A day...  of rebuke</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of reproof</span>, <span class="accented">or punishment</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/149-7.htm">Psalm 149:7</a> and <a href="../../par/hosea/5-9.htm">Hosea 5:9</a>). That God should have allowed such an insulting embassy to come and go in safety was a mode of reproving his people, and to some extent punishing them for their sins. Even Hezekiah himself deserved reproof for having so long placed his reliance upon Egypt (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6, 9</a>), though now apparently he had turned to Jehovah, and relied on him only (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-7.htm">Isaiah 36:7, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Blasphemy</span>. So Delitzsch. Mr. Cheyne suggests "contumely," and Dr. Kay "contempt." But the meaning "blasphemy," which Mr. Cheyne confesses to "suit the context," is required in all the other passages where (substantially) the same word occurs (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-18.htm">Nehemiah 9:18, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a>). Hezekiah calls the day one "of blasphemy," on account of Rabshakeh's impious utterances (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-15.htm">Isaiah 36:15, 18, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The children are come to the birth</span>, etc. This was a proverbial phrase for a time of extreme difficulty (see <a href="../../par/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>), and is not to be pressed as embodying at all a close analogy. Judah was in sore trouble, and was expecting deliverance. It seemed now as if she would not have strength to go through the crisis, but would perish through weakness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4</a></div><div class="verse">It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up <i>thy</i> prayer for the remnant that is left.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It may be the Lord...  will hear</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "will notice," or "will punish." If Isaiah laid the matter before God, and prayed earnestly, it was possible that God would intervene to save Judah, and punish the blapshemous words uttered. <span class="cmt_word">The living God</span>. In opposition to the dead idols of the heathen, which had neither life, nor breath, nor perception (see <a href="../../par/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The remnant that is left</span>. It is usual to explain this of Judah generally, which still survived, although Israel had been carried away captive. But perhaps the contrast is rather between the numerous <span class="accented">Judaean</span> captives who had been taken and conveyed to Assyria by Sennacherib when he took the "fenced cities" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1</a>), and the portion of the nation which still remained in the land. Sennacherib says, in his annals, that he took "forty-six" cities, and carried captive to Assyria above two hundred thousand persons ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 38).

Some suppose "tidings of the movements of Tirhakah;" others, "tidings of the destruction of his host;" a few, "tidings of an insurrection in some other part of the Assyrian empire." This last supposition is wholly gratuitous, since we have no indication, either in Scripture or in the inscriptions, of any such insurrection. The choice lies between the other two, or between one or other of them, and the two combined. The vagueness is owing, not to the time at which the present narrative took shape, but to the fact that a vague promise - quite sufficient for its purpose - was given at first, the filling in of the details being reserved for a later period (see vers. 22-35). <span class="cmt_word">I will cause him to fall by the sword</span> (see ver. 38). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a></div><div class="verse">So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rabshakeh...  found the King of Assyria warring against Libnah.</span> Libnah was a town at no great distance from Lachish (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-31.htm">Joshua 10:31</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39-42</a>). It was also near Mareshah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42-44</a>), and must therefore have belonged to the more southern portion of the Shefeleh, and probably to the eastern region, where the hills sink down into the plain. The exact site is very uncertain, and still remains to be discovered. Sennacherib's object in moving upon Libnah is doubtful; but it would seem, from his monuments, that he had captured Lachish (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152), and had gone on to Libnah, as the next stronghold on the way to Egypt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-9.htm">Isaiah 37:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard <i>it</i>, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tirhakah, King of Ethopia</span>. Tirhakah is among the most famous of the monarchs belonging to this period. The Greeks called him "Tearchon," the Assyrians "Tarku" or "Tarqu." His name, as represented on his own monuments, is "Tahark" or "Tahrak." According to the Egyptian remains, he had a reign of at least twenty-six years in Egypt - from  <span class="date">B.C. 693</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 667</span>. He would seem, however, to have been King of Ethiopia, and lord paramount of the lower valley of the Nile, from about  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, Shabatok for some years ruling Egypt, or a portion of it, as his deputy (Rawlinson, 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 450). Hezekiah's negotiations had, it is probable, been with Tirhakah (ch. 19:13; 20:5; 30:1-6). This monarch, having engaged to help him, now put his  forces in motion, and began to descend the Nile valley to his relief. His movement rather provoked than alarmed Sennacherib, who, having defeated one Egyptian army in  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span> ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, 134), was confident of success against another. <span class="cmt_word">He sent messengers</span>. It is not very clear what advantage Sennacherib expected from this second embassy. He had no fresh argument to bring forward, unless it were a suggestion that Hezekiah's God was endeavouring to deceive him. In the main, vers. 10-13 are a mere expansion of <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-10.htm">Isaiah 37:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee</span>. Sennacherib recognized Jehovah as a god, the God of the Jews, but put him on a par with the other "gods of the nations" (ver. 11), and (lid not believe in his being able to contend with Asshur. If he were really, through his priests or prophets, giving Hezekiah assurances of protection and deliverance, he could only be "deceiving" him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-11.htm">Isaiah 37:11</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands</span> (compare the Assyrian inscriptions, <span class="accented">passim</span>). Tiglath-Pileser I. calls himself " the conquering hero, the terror of whose name has overwhelmed <span class="accented">all regions"</span> ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 8); Asshur-izir-pal, "the king who subdued <span class="accented">all the races of men"</span> (ibid., ch. 7. p. 11); Shalmaneser II., "the marcher over <span class="accented">the whole world"</span> (ibid., vol. 5. p. 29); Shamas-Vul, "the trampler on the <span class="accented">world"</span> (ibid., vol. 1:12). Sargon says that "the gods had granted him the exercise of his sovereignty over <span class="accented">all</span> kings" (ibid., ch. 9. p. 4), and that he "<span class="accented">reigned</span> from the two beginnings to the two ends of the four celestial points" (ibid., ch. 11. p. 33), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the furthest north to the furthest south, and from the extreme cast to the extreme west. Sennacherib himself says, "<span class="accented">Aashur</span>, father of the gods, among all kings firmly has raised me, and <span class="accented">over all that dwell in the countries</span> he caused to increase my weapons" (ibid., ch. 11. p. 49). From first to last, in their inscriptions, the monarchs claim a universal dominion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-12.htm">Isaiah 37:12</a></div><div class="verse">Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, <i>as</i> Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which <i>were</i> in Telassar?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My fathers</span>. The Assyrian monarchs call all those who have preceded them upon the throne their "fathers," without intending to claim any blood-relation-ship. Sargon, Sennacherib's father, though a usurper and the first king of a new dynasty, frequently speaks of "the kings his fathers" ('Records of the Past,' ch. 7. pp. 39, 51, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Gozan...  Haran ...   Rezeph...  Telassar</span>. "Gozan" is, beyond all doubt, the region known to the Greeks as Gauzanitis, which was the eastern portion of Upper Mesopotamia, or the country about the sources of the Khabour river. The <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> conquest of this tract is indicated by the settlement of the Israelites in the region (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). "Harsh" is the well-known "city of Nahor" (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>), called in <a href="../../par/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a> "<span class="accented">Charran</span>," and by the Greeks and Romans, Carrhae. It has now recovered its old designation, and is known as <span class="accented">Hurrah.</span> "Rezeph" was in the neighborhood of Haran, and is mentioned as belonging to Assyria as early as  <span class="date">B.C. 775</span> ('Eponym Canon,' p. 82). It had probably revolted and been reduced at a later date. "Telassar," "the Hill of <span class="accented">Asshur</span>," is not mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, but was probably the Assyrian name of a town on or near the Euphrates, in the country of the Bent-Eden, which was not far from Carche-mish (see 'Records of the Past,' ch. 3. pp. 90-92). <span class="cmt_word">The children of Eden</span>. The Assyrian inscriptions mention a "Bit-Adini" (comp. <span class="accented">Amos</span> 1:5), and a chief who is called "the son of Adini;" both belonging to the Middle Euphrates region. The "children of Eden" (Beni-Eden) were probably the people of the tract about Bit-Adini.

Sennacherib sent his present message in a written form. The communications between kings were often carried on in this way (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>). The Hebrews use the same word for "letter" and "book;" but, when a letter is intended, employ generally the plural number (compare the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">litterae</span>). And spread it before the Lord. Not that God might see it and read it, in a material sense, but still that he might take note of it, and, if he saw fit, punish it. Compare the exhibition of the Books of the Law, painted with idolatrous emblems, at Maspha, "over against" the temple, by Judas Maccabaeus and his companions (1 Macc. 3:46-48). The act in both cases implied the referring of the whole matter to God for his consideration. It was, as Delitzsch, says, a sort of "prayer without words."

It has been <span class="accented">questioned</span> whether Hezekiah was really as pronounced a monotheist as these expressions would imply, and suggested that  his actual words received "a colouring" from a later writer. Hezekiah's contemporaries, it is said, Isaiah and Micah, make no such strong statements of their belief in one only God as this (Kuenen, Cheyne). But it is difficult to see what can be a clearer revelation of monotheism than <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>, or what truth more absolutely underlies the whole of Isaiah's teaching than the unity of the Supreme Being. The same under-current is observable in Micah (<a href="../../par/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17, 18</a>). Sennacherib's belief, that each country has its own god (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>), is not shared by the religious Jews of his time. They are well aware that the heathen gods are "vanity" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a>), "wind" and "confusion" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>, etc.).

This was a stubborn fact, which it was impossible to deny. From the time of Asshur-izir-pal at any rate, about  <span class="date">B.C. 880</span>, Assyria had pursued for nearly two centuries a steady career of conquest, reducing the nations which were her neighbors, almost without exception, and gradually spreading her power from the tract immediately about Nineveh to the Persian Gulf on the south, the great plateau of Iran on the east, the Armenian Mountains (Niphates and Taurus) on the north, and on the west to Cilicia and the Mediterranean. Her progress towards the west alone is marked in Scripture, since there alone she came in contact with God's people. Under Pul (about  <span class="date">B.C. 760</span>) she attacked Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>); under Tiglath-Pileser II. she carried off a portion of the ten tribes (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>); under the same monarch she subjugated Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>); under Shalmaneser she besieged (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>), and under Sargon took, Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>); under Sargon also she invaded Philistia and captured Ashdod (ch. 20:1). Now she was bent on subduing Judaea, and so preparing the way for the reduction of Egypt. Humanly speaking, it was most unlikely that the small and weak state of Judaea would be able to resist her. But God was all-powerful, and might be pleased to cast down, as he had been pleased to exalt (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-19</a>). Hence Hezekiah's appeal.

The personification here is very effective. since it represents Jerusalem as a tender maiden, weak and delicate, yet still bold enough to stand up against Sennacherib and all his host, and bid him defiance. Confident in Jehovah, her Protector, she despises him, and laughs him to scorn; nay, "shakes her head at him," or rather. "after him," pursuing him with scornful gestures as In. retreats before her. (On shaking the head as a gesture of scorn, see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/109-25.htm">Psalm 109:25</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>.)

And hast said. Sennacherib had not actually uttered these words with his mouth; but the prophet clothes in his own highly poetic language the thoughts which the Assyrian king had cherished in his heart. He had regarded "the multitude of his chariots" as irresistible; he had considered that the mountains which guarded Palestine would be no obstacle to his advance; he had contemplated ravaging and despoiling of its timber the entire country; he had meant to penetrate into every region that was lovely and fertile. The emphatic "I" of the original <span class="accented">- ani -</span> twice repeated, marks the proud egotism of the monarch. <span class="cmt_word">By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with the multitude</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">with chariots upon chariots.</span> The Assyrian kings contrived to cross with their chariots mountain chains of great difficulty, and frequently boast of the achievement. Tiglath-Pileser I. says, "I assembled my chariots and warriors. I betook myself to carts of iron in order to overcome the rough mountains and their difficult marches. I made the wilderness thus practicable for the passage of my chariots and warriors" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 9, 10). Asshur-izir-pal, "The rugged hill country, unfitted for the passage of chariots and armies, with instruments of iron I cut through, and with metal rollers I beat down the chariots and troops I brought over" (ibid., vol. 3. p. 58). Shalmaneser II., "Trackless paths, difficult mountains, which like the point of an iron sword stood pointed to the sky, on wheels of iron and bronze I penetrated. My chariots and armies I transported over them" (ibid., p. 85). In the less rough parts, while the warders dismounted, tire horses drew the chariots, which were assisted over obstacles by attendants ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74); but, in regions of greater difficulty, they were conveyed across the mountain ranges in waggons of rude and strong construction ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 13) The chariot-force was regarded as so important that the Assyrians never made any distant expedition without it. <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon</span>. It was not necessary to cross either Libanus or Anti-Libanus in order to invade Judaea, <span class="accented">since</span> the natural route was along the Coele-Syrian valley and across the spurs of Hermon to the Jordan; but an Assyrian army was intent on plunder and devastation, no less than upon conquest, and would ascend mountain regions that did not lie on its direct line of march for either or both of these objects. It was customary for the soldiers to cut clown the tall cedars and choice fir trees of Lebanon on their Syrian campaigns, in order to transport the timber to Nineveh and other great cities, where it was used for building (see the comment on Isaiah 14:8, and compare Layard, 'Nineveh and <span class="accented">Babylon</span>,' pp. 356, 357, and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 47, 83, 90; vol. 5. p. 119; vol. 9. p. 16, etc.). It was also customary to destroy the trees in an enemy's country, simply in order to inflict injury upon the foe ('Ancient Monarchies.' vol. 2. p. 84). <span class="cmt_word">I will enter into the height of his border</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I will enter into its uttermost height</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will penetrate through the entire mountain region of Palestine, called roughly "Lebanon," to the furthest height of any importance - that on which Jerusalem stood - and thus occupy the whole land. The parallel passage of 2 Kings has "lodging" for "height," in apparent allusion to the palace of Hezekiah. And the forest of his Carmel; or, <span class="accented">the forest of its pleasure-garden</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rich plantation tracts, covered with vines, olives, and fig trees, which formed the special glory of Judaea (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16, 17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-25.htm">Isaiah 37:25</a></div><div class="verse">I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have digged, and drunk water</span>. Sennacherib notes three natural obstacles to his advance - the forces of his opponents he does not appear to account an obstacle - viz. mountains, deserts, rivers. Mountains do not stop him - he crosses them even with his chariot-force (ver. 24). Deserts do not stop him - he digs wells there, and drinks their waters. Rivers will not stop him - he will dry them up, trample them into puddles. Note the contrast between the past tenses, "I have come up," "I have digged," "I have drunk," and the future, "I will dry up." He had crossed the mountain ranges Sinjar, Amanus, Lebanon; he had passed waterless tracts, where he had had to dig wells, in Mesopotamia and Northern Syria. He was about to find his chief obstacle, rivers, when he invaded Lower Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">The rivers of the besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the rivers of Egypt. Mazor</span>, the singular form (compare Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and modern Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span>), is used here (as in <a href="../../par/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>, and perhaps in <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>), instead of the ordinary dual term, <span class="accented">Miz-raim</span>, probably because Lower Egypt is especially intended. Sennacherib was looking especially to the invasion of Lower Egypt,where the Nile had "seven branches" (Herod., 2:17), and the country was also cut up by numerous canals, which would naturally constitute a great difficulty to a force depending mainly on its chariots. He  believed, however, in his heart, that he would find a way of "drying up" these "rivers."

Art thou so ignorant, so devoid of that light of nature, which should "lighten every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>), as not to know God's method of governing the world? How that "from long ago," in his eternal counsels, he designs the rise and fall of nations, and the mode in which their destruction is to be brought about? Art thou not aware that conquerors are mere instruments in God's hands - "the rods of his anger" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>) - to work his will, and then to have his will worked upon them in turn (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6-19</a>)?

He had been the axe in the hand of the hewer (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>), the saw, the rod, the staff, of God's indignation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>), the executor of his vengeance.

The delicate grass of spring in the East withers within a few weeks, and the fresh and tender herbage becomes yellow, parched, and sapless.

The meaning is that God has, and has had, his eye on Sennacherib throughout all his career, seeing to and watching over his performance of his will. The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">going out, and coming in</span>, is a Hebrew idiom for a man's doings (see <a href="../../par/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thy rage against me</span>.

The Assyrians were in the habit of passing "hooks" or "rings" through the noses or lips of their more distinguished prisoners, and attaching a thong to the hook or ring, by which they led the prisoners into the royal presence ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 304; vol. 3. p. 436). The expressions used derive their force from these practices, but are not in the present place to be understood literally. God "turned Sennacherib back" and reconducted him to Nineveh. not with an actual "hook" or "thong," but by the "bridle" of necessity.

"This," he says, "shall be the sign unto thee of Sennachcrib's being effectually 'bridled,' and the danger from Assyria over. In the third year from the present the land shall have returned to its normal condition, and you shall enjoy its fruits as formerly. Meanwhile you shall obtain sufficient nourishment from the grain which has sown itself." The "third year," according to Hebrew reckoning, might be little more than one year from the date of the delivery of the prophecy. The entire withdrawal of all the Assyrian garrisons from the country, which no doubt followed on Sennacherib's retreat, might well have occupied the greater part of a year. Till they were withdrawn, the Jews could not venture to till their territory. <span class="cmt_word">Plant vineyards</span>. The Assyrians had, no doubt, cut down the vines (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 62, 79; vol. 7. p. 43, etc.; Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pl. 40).

Take root downward, and bear fruit upward; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "spread over the land, and became firmly rooted in it, and flourish as in the former time." We must conceive of the Assyrians having, in their two recent invasions, completely depopulated the country districts. Numbers had, no doubt, been slain; more than two hundred thousand had been carried into captivity; a portion had found refuge in the capital On the withdrawal of the Assyrians,  these last "went forth," reoccupied their lands, and rebuilt their towns and villages. The blessing of God was upon them, and in a short time Judaea recovered her ancient vigour, so that, under Josiah, she was able to extend her dominion over almost the whole of the old Israelite territory (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6, 18</a>).

For Hezekiah's satisfaction and consolation something more definite is needed than the vague assurances that "the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head at Sennacherib" (ver. 22), and that God would "put a bridle in Sennacherib's mouth" (ver. 29). Accordingly, it is now declared, in the plainest terms, that he shall not even lay siege to the city, but shall return by the way by which he came - the coast route - leaving Jerusalem untouched, nay, unattempted. <span class="cmt_word">He shall not come into this city</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto the city.</span> He was at Libnah, in the Shefeleh, thirty or forty miles from Jerusalem, when we last heard of him (ver. 8); and, having then been just informed of the advance of Tirhakah, he is likely to have proceeded on towards Egypt. There is, at any rate, not the slightest intimation of his having made a retrograde movement towards the Jewish capital. <span class="cmt_word">Nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it</span>. The main points of an Assyrian siege are happily seized. The first assailants were the archers. They boldly approached in large bodies, and strove to clear the battlements of the defenders. Then shields were brought into play. Under their cover the archers drew nearer; the scaling parties brought up their ladders; the miners attacked the foundations of the walls; and the torch-bearers endeavoured to fire the gates. Finally, if these tactics did not avail, banks were raised against the walls, which were then assailed with battering-rams till they were breached and the assailants could cuter. God promises that Jerusalem shall experience none of these things at Sennacherib's hands. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-34.htm">Isaiah 37:34</a></div><div class="verse">By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the way that he came</span>. It is clear that Sennacherib on this occasion had marched by the usual coast route, through Sharon and the Shefeleh, upon Lachish, leaving Jerusalem far to his left. From Laehish he sent Rabshakeh to Hezekiah with a threatening message, and (as our version has it) "<span class="accented">with</span> a great army;" rather, "with a strong force." Rabshakeh, having delivered his message, returned to his master (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>), doubtless with his escort. Sennacherib then sent a letter by messengers, but without an army, so far as we are told, to renew his threats. Meanwhile from Lachish he went to Libnah, after which we know nothing of his movements, unless we accept the Egyptian account, which was, that he advanced to Pelusium. The declaration, "By the way that he came, by the same shall he return" (comp. ver. 29) was the most comforting that Hezekiah could possibly receive. It assured him that he would not even be confronted with his enemy. Into this city; rather, <span class="accented">unto this city</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> in ver. 32). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-35.htm">Isaiah 37:35</a></div><div class="verse">For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will defend this city...  for mine own sake</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will cover over this city</span>, as a bird covers its young with its wings (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-5.htm">Isaiah 31:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). God would do this "for his own sake;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because his own honour was concerned in the defence of his people. He would also do it for his servant David's sake; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the promises made to David, that his children should sit upon his throne (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29-37</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11-14</a>, etc.), which involved the continued independence of Judaea and Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a></div><div class="verse">Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they <i>were</i> all dead corpses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the angel of the Lord went forth</span>. The parallel passage of Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>) has, "It came to pass <span class="accented">that night</span>, that the angel of the Lord went out." The word of Isaiah had its accomplishment within a few hours. On the camp of the Assyrians, wherever it was, whether at Libnah, or at Pelusium (Herod., 2:141), or between the two, in the dead of night, the destroying angel swooped down, and silently, without disturbance, took the lives of a hundred and eighty-five thousand' men. The camp was no doubt that in which Sennacherib commanded. It is contrary to the whole tenor of the Assyrian inscriptions to imagine that a mere <span class="accented">corps d'armee</span>, detached to threaten, not to besiege, Jerusalem, could have been one-half, or one-quarter, so numerous. It was Sennacherib's host, not the Tartan's, that was visited. So the Egyptian tradition; so ver. 37, by implication. That in later times the Jews should have transferred the scene of the slaughter to the vicinity of their own capital, as Josephus does ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:2. &sect; 5), is not surprising, especially as the Egyptians claimed the glory of the discomfiture for their own gods, and the completion of the victory for their own soldiers. The nature of the destruction is not, perhaps, very important, if it be allowed to have been supernatural; but the "simoom" of Prideaux and Milman, the "storm" of Vitringa and Stanley, the "nocturnal attack by Tirhakah" of Usher, Preiss, and Michaelis, and the "pestilence"  of most other commentators, seem to be alike precluded by the terms of the narrative, which imply the silent death in one night of a hundred and eighty-five thousand persons by what English juries call "the visitation of God." The nearest parallel which Holy Scripture offers is the destruction of the firstborn in Egypt; but that was not, as this, without disturbance (see <a href="../../par/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>). There a "great cry" broke the silence of the night; here it was not till morning, when men woke from their peaceful slumbers, that the discovery was made that "they were all dead corpses." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-37.htm">Isaiah 37:37</a></div><div class="verse">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Sennacherib...   departed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">broke up his camp.</span> The word used for all the removals of the children of Israel in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3-48</a>). The loss of even an entire <span class="accented">corps d'armeee</span> would not have caused an Assyrian king, at the head of an intact main army, to break up his camp and abandon his enterprise. <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt at Nineveh</span>. Sennacherib lived some eighteen or twenty years from the probable date of his discomfiture, dying in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. His ordinary residence was at Nineveh, which he greatly adorned and beautified ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11. pp. 55-57). His father, Sargon, on the contrary, dwelt commonly at Khorsabad (Dur-Sargina), and his son, Esarhaddon, dwelt, during the latter part of his reign, at Babylon. We must not suppose, however, that Sennacherib was shut up in Nineveh during the remainder of his life. On the contrary, he made frequent expeditions towards the south, the east, and the north. But he made no farther expedition to the south-west, no further attack on Jerusalem, or attempt on Egypt. The Jews had peace, so far as the Assyrians were concerned, from the event related in ver. 36 to a late date in the reign of Esarhaddon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nisroch his god</span>. The name Nisroch has not been found in the Assyrian inscriptions, and is, in fact, read only in this place and the parallel passage of Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>). It has been supposed to represent Nusku, an Assyrian god of a somewhat low position, who, however, does not obtain mention in the historical inscriptions until the time of Asshur-bani-pal. Probably the name has suffered corruption. Asshur was, in fact, Sennacherib's favourite deity, and it is remarkable that the LXX. give in this place, not Nisroch, but <span class="accented">Asarach.</span> "Asarach" would seem to be "Asshur" with a guttural suffix. <span class="cmt_word">Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him.</span> The murder of Sennacherib by a son, whom he called "Ardumazanes," was related by Polyhistor (ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:5, &sect; l). Esar-haddon's annals are imperfect at the commencement, but show that his authority was at first contested, and that he had to establish it by force of arms ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 103, 104). Adrammelech seems to have assumed the title of king (Abyden. up. Euscb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:9, &sect; 1), and to have been put to death by his brother. Sharezer is not elsewhere mentioned. The name is Assyrian, as far as it goes, but is incomplete. Its full form was probably Nabu-sar-uzur or Nergal-sar-uzur (see 'Eponym Canon,' p. 63,  <span class="date">B.C. 682</span> and 678). And escaped into the land of Armenia. So Moses of Chorene ('Hist. Armen.,' 1:22). The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">Ararat</span> (Assyrian <span class="accented">Urardu</span> or <span class="accented">Urartu</span>), which was the more eastern portion of Armenia, and lay beyond the sphere of Assyrian influence. Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. Esarhaddon (Asshur-akh iddiua) appears to have ascended the throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. It is highly improbable that Isaiah was then living, and therefore the verse can scarcely be from his pen. It has probably been transferred from 2 Kings (2 Kings 19:37) in order to finish off the narrative. Esarhaddon outlived Hezekiah many years, and was brought into contact with Manasseh ('Eponym Canon,' p. 139), whom he reckoned among his tributaries (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/36.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 36"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 36" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/38.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 38"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 38" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
