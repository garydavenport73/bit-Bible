The unbelief was likely to be intensified when so marvellous a prophecy was delivered as that which he was now commissioned to put forth. Still, of course, there is rhetorical exaggeration in the question, which seems to imply that no one would believe. Our report; literally, <span class="accented">that which has been heard by us.</span> But the word is used technically for a prophetic revelation (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>). Here it would seem to refer especially to the Messianic prophecies delivered by Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</span> The "arm of the Lord," which has been "made bare in the eyes of all the nations" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>), yet requires the eye of faith to see it. Many Jews would not see the working of God's providence in the victories of Cyrus, or in the decision to which he came to restore the Jews to their own country. Unbelief can always assign the most plainly providential arrangements to happy accident. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a></div><div class="verse">For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, <i>there is</i> no beauty that we should desire him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he shall grow up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">now he grew up.</span> The verbs are, all of them, in the past, or completed tense, until ver. 7, and are to be regarded as "perfects of prophetic certitude." As Mr. Cheyne remarks, "All has been finished before the foundations of the world in the Divine counsels." Before him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "before Jehovah" - under the fostering care of Jehovah (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40, 52</a>). God the Father had his eye ever fixed upon the Son with watchfulness and tenderness and love. <span class="cmt_word">As a tender plant</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a sapling</span>, or <span class="accented">as a sucker</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/8-16.htm">Job 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>). The "branch" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 10</a> - a different word - has nearly the same meaning. The Messiah will be a fresh sprout from the stump of a tree that has been felled; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the destroyed Davidic monarchy. As a root (so <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). The "sapling" from the house of David shall become the "root" out of which his Church will grow (comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of a dry ground</span>. Either out of the "dry ground" of a corrupt age and nation, or out of the arid soil of humanity. In the East it is not unusual to see a tall succulent plant growing from a soft which seems   utterly devoid of moisture. Such plants have roots that strike deep, and draw their nourishment from a hidden source. <span class="cmt_word">He hath no form nor comeliness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he had no form nor majesty.</span> It is scarcely the prophet's intention to describe the personal appearance of our Lord. What he means is that "the Servant" would have no splendid surroundings, no regal pomp nor splendour - nothing about him to attract men's eyes, or make them think him anything extraordinary. It is impossible to suppose that there was not in his appearance something of winning grace and quiet majesty. but it was of a kind that was not adapted to draw the gaze of the multitude. <span class="cmt_word">And when we shall see him</span>. Some connect this clause with the preceding, and translate, "He hath no form nor comeliness, that we should regard him; no beauty, that we should desire him" (Lowth, Vitringa, Gesenius, Ewald, Knobel, Henderson, Urwick. But Stier, Delitzsch, Kay, and Mr. Cheyne prefer the construction found in the Authorized Version). No beauty; literally, no <span class="accented">sightliness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nothing to attract the eye or arrest it. The spiritual beauties of holy and sweet expression and majestic calm could only have ben spiritually discerned.

Our Lord had at no time more than a "little flock" attached to him. Of these, after a time, "many went back, and walked no more with him" (<a href="../../par/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>). Some, who believed on him, would only come to him by night (<a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). All the "rulers" and great men held aloof from him (<a href="../../par/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>). At the end, even his apostles "forsook him, and fled" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A Man of sorrows</span>. The word translated "sorrows" means also pains of any kind. But the beautiful rendering of our version may well stand, since there are many places where the word used certainly means "sorrow" and nothing else (see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-29.htm">2 Chronicles 6:29</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12, 18</a>, etc.).

The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore be retained. <span class="cmt_word">We hid as it were our faces from him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and there was as it were the hiding of the face from him.</span> Some suppose the hiding of God's face to be intended; but the context, which describes the treatment of the Servant by his fellow-men, makes the meaning given in our version far preferable. Men turned their faces from him when they met him, would not see him, would not recognize him (comp. <a href="../../par/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-17</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a></div><div class="verse">Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely he hath borne our griefs</span>; or, <span class="accented">surely they were our griefs which he bore.</span> The pronouns are emphatic. Having set forth at length the fact of the Servant's humiliation (vers. 2, 3), the prophet hastens to declare the reason of it. Twelve times over within the space of nine verses he asserts. with the most emphatic reiteration, that all the Servant's sufferings were vicarious, borne for him, to save him from the consequences of his sins, to enable him to escape punishment. The doctrine thus taught in the Old Testament is set forth! with equal distinctness in the New (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-50.htm">John 11:50-52</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, etc.), and forms the hope, the trust, and the consolation of Christians. and carried our sorrows. The application which St. Matthew makes of this passage to our Lord's miracles of healing (Matthew 8:17) is certainly not the primary sense of the words, but may be regarded as a secondary application of them. Christ's sufferings were the remedy for all the ills that flesh is heir to. <span class="cmt_word">Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God</span>. They who saw Christ suffer, instead of understanding that he was bearing the sins of others in a mediatorial capacity, imagined that he was suffering at God's hands for his own sins. Hence they scoffed at him and reviled him, even in his greatest agonies (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>). To one only, and him not one of God's people, was it given to see the contrary, and to declare aloud, at the moment of the death, "Certainly this was a righteous Man" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>).

This verse contains four asseverations of the great truth that all Christ's sufferings were for us, and constituted the atonement for our sins. The form is varied, but the truth is one.

"No stronger expression could be found in Hebrew to denote severity of suffering - suffering unto death" (Urwick). <span class="cmt_word">The chastisement of our peace was upon him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the chastisement which brought us peace," which put a stop to the enmity between fallen man and an offended God - which made them once more <span class="accented">at one</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15-17</a>, "Having <span class="accented">abolished in his flesh the enmity</span>, even the Law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, <span class="accented">so making peace</span>; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, <span class="accented">having slain the enmity thereby:</span> and came and preached <span class="accented">peace</span> to you which were afar off;" <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, "Having <span class="accented">made peace</span> through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself"). <span class="cmt_word">With his stripes we are healed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">we were healed</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, "By whose stripes ye were healed"). Besides the blows inflicted on him with the hand (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a>) and with the reed (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>), our Lord was judicially scourged (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>). Such scourging would leave the "stripe-marks" which are here spoken of.

There was "none that did good" absolutely - "no, not one" (<a href="../../par/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>). All had quitted "the way of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>) to walk in their "own ways" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath laid on him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Lord caused to light upon him.</span> God the Father, as the primary Disposer of all things, lays upon the Son the burden, which the Son voluntarily accepts.

He prays to the Father, "Let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but <span class="accented">as thou wilt"</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). So St. John says that the Father "sent the Son to be the Propitiation for our sins" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). And St. Paul tells us that God (the Father) "made him to be sin for us who knew no sin" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). It does not lessen the Son's exceeding mercy and loving-kindness in accepting the burden, that it was laid upon him by the Father. <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of us all</span> (compare the initial "All we"). The redemption is as universal as the sin, at any rate potentially.

The position of the emphatic pronoun (<span class="accented">hu</span>) <span class="accented">be</span>tween the first participle and the second detaches the second clause from the first and conjoins it with the third. Otherwise the rendering of the Authorized Version might stand.

The contrast of the Servant's silence and passivity with men's ordinary vehemence of self-assertion under ill usage is most striking. Who was ever silent but he under such extremity of provocation? (For a contrast, see the account of the Jewish martyrdoms in 2 Macc. 7.) <span class="cmt_word">He is brought as a lamb</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as the lamb.</span> The Paschal lamb is, perhaps, intended, or, at any rate, the lamb of sacrifice. The prophet has often seen the dumb, innocent lamb led in silence to the altar, to be slain there, and thinks of that touching sight. It was probably the use of this imagery here which caused the Baptist to term our Lord "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a sheep before her shearers</span>.

The present world, the earth (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-11.htm">Isaiah 38:11</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/job/28-13.htm">Job 28:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the transgression of my people was he stricken</span>. The sentiment is the same as in ver. 5, but with the difference that there it was suffering only, here it is death itself, which the Servant endures for man. "My people" may be either "God's people" or "the prophet's people," according as the speaker is regarded as Isaiah or Jehovah. Jehovah certainly becomes the Speaker in vers. 11, 12. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither <i>was any</i> deceit in his mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made his grave with the wicked</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they assigned him his grave with the wicked.</span> The verb is used impersonally. Those who condemned Christ to be crucified with two malefactors on the common execution-ground - "the place of a skull" - meant his grave to be "with the wicked," with whom it would naturally have been but for the interference of Joseph of Arimathaea. Crucified persons were buried with their crosses near the scene of their crucifixion by the Romans<span class="cmt_word">. And with the rich in his death</span>; or, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">he was</span>) <span class="accented">with a rich one after his death.</span> In the preceding clause, the word translated "the wicked" is plural, but in the present, the word translated "the rich" is singular. The expression translated "in his death" means "when he was dead," "after death" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-31.htm">1 Kings 13:31</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>). The words have a singularly exact fulfilment in the interment of our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. The preposition used may mean either "because" or "although." The ambiguity is, perhaps, intentional. <span class="cmt_word">He had done no violence</span>; or, no <span class="accented">wrong</span> (see <a href="../../par/genesis/16-5.htm">Genesis 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-17.htm">1 Chronicles 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a> (margin); <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>). The LXX. give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> while St. Peter renders the word used by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>). The sinlessness of Christ is asserted by himself (<a href="../../par/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46</a>), and forms the main argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews for the superiority of the new covenant over the old (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). It is also witnessed to by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>), by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), and by St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>). As no other man was ever without sin, it follows that the Servant of the present chapter <span class="accented">must</span> be Jesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a></div><div class="verse">Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put <i>him</i> to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see <i>his</i> seed, he shall prolong <i>his</i> days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him</span> (see the comment on ver. 6, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). The sufferings of Christ, proceeding from the "determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), and being permitted by him; were in some sort his doing. It "pleased him," moreover, that they should be undergone, for he saw with satisfaction the Son's self-sacrifice, and he witnessed with joy man's redemption and deliverance effected thereby. He hath put him to grief; rather, <span class="accented">he dealt grievously -</span> a sort of <span class="accented">hend-adys.</span> "He bruised him with a grievous bruising." <span class="cmt_word">When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin</span>. It is proposed (Ewald, Cheyne), by the alteration of a letter, to make the passage run thus: "When <span class="accented">he</span> shall make his soul an offering," etc., and argued that "he who offers the Servant's life as a sacrifice must be the Servant himself, <span class="accented">and not</span> Jehovah" (Cheyne). No doubt the Servant did offer his own life (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>," He gave his soul a ransom for many"); but that fact does not preclude the possibility of the Father having also offered it. "Believest thou not," said our Lord to Philip, "that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works" (<a href="../../par/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>). This <span class="accented">perienchoresis</span>, as the ancient theologians called it, makes it possible to predicate of the Father almost all the actions which can be predicated of the Son - all, in fact, excepting those which belong to the Son's humanity, or which involve obedience and subordination. As the Father had "laid on Christ the iniquity of us all" (ver. 6), as he had "bruised him and put him to grief," so he might be said to have "made his soul an offering for sin." All was settled in the Divine counsels from all eternity, and when the ideal became the actual, God the Father wrought with God the Son to effectuate it. "Offerings for sin," or "guilt offerings," were distinct from "sin offerings." The object of the former was "satisfaction," of the latter "expiation." The Servant of Jehovah was, however, to be both. "As in ver. 5 the Divine Servant is represented as a Sin Offering, his death being an expiation, so here he is described as a Guilt Offering, his death being a satisfaction" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 151). <span class="cmt_word">He shall see his</span> <span class="cmt_word">seed</span>. The "seed" of a teacher of religion are his disciples. St. Paul speaks of Onesimus as one whom he had "begotten in his bends" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>). He calls himself by implication the "father" of his Corinthian converts (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Both he and St. John address their disciples as "little children" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 18, 25</a> I:3:7, 18 I:4:4 I:5:21). It had long previously been promised that "a seed should serve" Messiah (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>). Our Lord himself occasionally called his disciples his "children" (<a href="../../par/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-5.htm">John 21:5</a>). He has always "seen his seed" in his true followers. <span class="cmt_word">He shall prolong his days.</span> A seeming contradiction  to the statement (ver. 8) that he should be "cut off" out of the land of the living; and the more surprising because his death is made the condition of this long life: "When thou shalt make his soul an offering [or, 'sacrifice'] for sin," then "he shall prolong his days." But the resurrection of Christ, and his entrance upon an immortal life (<a href="../../par/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), after offering himself as a Sacrifice upon the cross, exactly meets the difficulty and solves the riddle (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pleasure of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord shall prosper in his hand.</span> "In his hand" means "by his instrumentality." The "pleasure of the Lord" is God's ultimate aim and end with respect to his universe. This would "prosper" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be advanced, wrought out, rendered effectual - by the instrumentality of Christ. "Taking the verse as a whole, it sets forth <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the origin, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the nature, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the result of the Saviour's sufferings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Taking the last clause by itself, we have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Divine complacency in the purpose of human salvation; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the successful issue of that purpose as administered by the Messiah" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 153). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a></div><div class="verse">He shall see of the travail of his soul, <i>and</i> shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of the travail of his soul he shall see</span>, <span class="accented">and be satisfied</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-11</a>, "He made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, <span class="accented">Wherefore</span> God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every name: that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father"). No cross - no crown. First, suffering, then glory. <span class="accented">Because</span> Christ suffered, and was bruised, and put to grief, and made a sacrifice for sin; <span class="accented">because</span> of all this "travail of his soul,"  <span class="accented">- therefore</span> it was given him to see the happy results of his sufferings - the formation of that Church which will live with him for ever in heaven (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-17</a>), and therewith to be "<span class="accented">satisfied."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify</span> <span class="cmt_word">many;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. "</span>by his knowledge of the Divine counsels and purpose, which he will impart to his disciples, shall my righteous Servant justify many" (literally, <span class="accented">the many</span>), or, in other words, "turn them from sin to righteousness" (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>). Nothing is so effectual in turning men to righteousness as teaching them the true knowledge of God  - his nature, his purposes with regard to them, his feelings towards them. Christ, from his own knowledge, gave men this knowledge, and so did all that could be done to draw them to his Father. And his efforts were not without result. The fruit of his teaching has been the justification of many - ay, of "the many," as both Isaiah and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>) testify. For he shall bear their iniquities; rather, <span class="accented">and their iniquities he himself shall bear.</span> The initial part of the clause is not "causal," but merely connective. There are two main things which Christ does for his people - he makes them righteous by infusing into them of his own righteousness; and he bears the burden of their iniquities, taking them upon himself, and by his perpetual intercession obtaining God's forgiveness of them. As Delitzsch says, "His continued taking of our trespasses upon himself is merely the constant presence and presentation of his atonement, which has been offered once for all. The dead yet living One, because of his one self-sacrifice, is an eternal Priest, who now lives to distribute the blessings which he has acquired" ('Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2:p. 338).

A repetition of the thought in the preceding clause (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-19.htm">Proverbs 16:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because he hath poured out his soul unto death</span>. Christ not only died for man, but, as it were, "poured out his soul" with his own hand to the last drop. The expression emphasizes the duration and the voluntariness of Messiah's sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">And he was numbered with the transgressors</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and he was reckoned with transgressors</span> (see <a href="../../par/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> where our Lord applies the words to himself). Christ was condemned as a "<span class="accented">blasphemer"</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>), crucified with malefactors (<a href="../../par/luke/23-32.htm">Luke 23:32</a>), called "that deceiver" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>), and regarded generally by the Jews as accursed (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he bare the sin of many;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and himself bare the sin of many</span> (compare the last clauses of vers. 6 and 11; and see also <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a><span class="cmt_word">).
