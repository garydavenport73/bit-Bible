The crowning judgment of all is now briefly described. "In that day" - the day of God's vengeance - when all his other enemies have been put down, Jehovah shall finally visit with his sword three mighty foes, which are described under three figures - the first as "Leviathan, the swift serpent;" the second as "Leviathan, the crooked serpent; "and the third as "the dragon that is in the sea." It has been usual to see in these three monsters three kingdoms inimical to God - either Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt; or Assyria, Egypt, and Tyre; or Media, Persia, and Egypt. But this diversity of interpretation shows that there is no particular fitness in the emblems to symbolize any special kingdoms or world-powers, while the imagery itself and the law of climax alike point to something higher than world-powers being intended. "Leviathan," in <a href="../../par/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>, where the word first occurs, represents a supra-mundane power - probably "the dragon, the enemy of light, who in old Eastern traditions is conceived as ready to swallow up sun and moon, and plunge creation in original chaos or darkness" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 28); and the "dragon" is a customary emblem of Satan himself (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7, 9</a>), the prince of darkness. The triple vengeance here is parallel to the triple punishment, in the apocalyptic vision (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>), of "the devil," "the beast," and "the false prophet," who have been termed by commentators "the three great enemies of God's kingdom" (see 'Speaker's Commentary on the New Testament,' vol. 4. p. 802). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord with his sore and great and strong sword</span>. The "sword" of Jehovah is first heard of in the Pentateuch, where it is called" glittering" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>). It is spoken of by David (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12</a>), and frequently by Isaiah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; 46:16). Mr. Cheyne supposes the idea to have been taken from the Baby-Ionian mythology, and seems to think it half material. But it is merely on a par with other anthrepomorphisms. The word rendered "sore" probably means "well-tempered," "keen." <span class="cmt_word">Leviathan</span>. Etymologically, the term "Leviathan" appears to mean "that which is coiled" or "twisted," whence it would seem to have been primarily applied, as in the present verse, to serpents. In <a href="../../par/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-34</a>, however, it manifestly designates the crocodile, while in <a href="../../par/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> it must be used of some kind of cetacean. Thus its most appropriate English rendering would be "monster." <span class="cmt_word">The piercing serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the fleet</span>, or <span class="accented">fugitive serpent</span>. It is a general characteristic of the snake tribe to glide away and hide themselves when disturbed. <span class="cmt_word">Even leviathan that crooked serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and also leviathan that crooked serpent</span>. It is quite clear that two distinct foes of God are pointed at - one characterized as "fleet," the other as "tortuous." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall slay the dragon.</span> Here is mention of a third enemy, probably Satan himself (see the introductory paragraph to this section). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a></div><div class="verse">In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - GOD'S CARE FOR HIS VINEYARD. This piece may be called a companion picture to <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, or a joy-song to be set over against that dirge. In both the figure of the vineyard is employed to express the people of God, and God is "the Lord of the vineyard." But whereas, on the former occasion, all was wrath and fury, menace and judgment, here all is mercy and loving-kindness, protection and promise. The difference is, no doubt, not with God, "with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), but with the vineyard, which is either not the same, or, if the same, then differently circumstanced. The vineyard of <a href="../../par/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>. is beyond all doubt the Jewish Church in the time of Isaiah, or in the times shortly after. The vineyard of the present place is either the Christian Church, or the Jewish Church reformed and purified by suffering. It is not the Church triumphant in heaven, since  there are still "briars and thorns" in it, and there are still those belonging to it who have to "make their peace with God." The prophet has come back from his investigations of the remote future and the supra-mundane sphere to something which belongs to earth, and perhaps not to a very distant period. His second "song of the vineyard" may well comfort the Church through all her earthly struggles. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing ye unto her</span>. Our translators have, strangely enough, inverted the order of the two clauses, which stand thus in the Hebrew: "A vineyard of red wine; sing ye unto it, "or "sing ye of it." The "vineyard of red wine" is one that produces abundance of rich fruit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a></div><div class="verse">I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest <i>any</i> hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I the Lord do keep</span> <span class="cmt_word">it</span>; or, g<span class="accented">uard</span> it (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>). Vineyards were considered to require special watching, since they were liable to damage both from thieves and foxes (<a href="../../par/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>). It was usual to build towers in them, from which a watch could be kept (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will water it every moment</span> (compare the threat in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>, "I will command my clouds that they rain no rain upon it"). The Church needs and receives "the continual dew of God's blessing." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a></div><div class="verse">Fury <i>is</i> not in me: who would set the briers <i>and</i> thorns against me in battle?

(Isaiah frequently ascribes "fury" to God, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-2.htm">Isaiah 34:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 20, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3, 5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Who would set the briars and thorns against me in battle?</span> The "briars and thorns" are apparently unrighteous members of the Church, who have fallen below their privileges. God asks, "Who will set the briars and thorns in array against me?" in a tone of contempt. "Who will dare to do battle against me with such weak material?" And then he adds a forecast of the result in such a case: "I would move forward; I would burn them all together" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/27-5.htm">Isaiah 27:5</a></div><div class="verse">Or let him take hold of my strength, <i>that</i> he may make peace with me; <i>and</i> he shall make peace with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or let him take hold of my strength</span>. There is another alternative. If the "thorns and the briars" are not prepared to contend in battle against God, let them adopt a different course. Let them "lay hold of God's strength," place themselves under his protection, and make their appeal to him, and see if they cannot "make their peace with him." A truly evangelical invitation! The enemies of God are entreated to cease from striving against him, and are taught that the door of repentance is still open to them. God is willing to be reconciled even to his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Let them make peace with him, make peace with him</span>. The reiteration constitutes an appeal of extreme earnestness and tenderness, which none could reject but the utterly impenitent.

A coming judgment upon Judah has been one of the main subjects of Isaiah's prophecy from the beginning. It has been included in the catalogue of "burdens" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>.). It will have to be one of the prophet's main subjects to the end of his "book." Hence he may at any time recur to it, as he does now, without special reason or excuse. In this place the special aspect under which the judgment presents itself to him is that of its merciful character, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in degree (vers. 7, 8); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in intention (ver. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>While noting this, he feels, however, bound to note also, that the judgment is, while it lasts, severe (vers. 10, 11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath he smitten him</span>; etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Has God smitten Judah, as he '(God) smote Judah's smiters?" Judah's chief smiters were Assyria and Babylon. The judgments upon them would be more severe than that upon Judah. They would be destroyed; Judah would be taken captive, and restored. <span class="cmt_word">Them that are slain by him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">them that slew him</span> (so Lowth, Ewald, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne). But, to obtain this meaning, the pointing of the present text must be altered. The law of parallelism seems, however, to require the alteration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a></div><div class="verse">In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Our translators have entirely mistaken the meaning of this verse. The proper rendering is, <span class="accented">In measure</span>, <span class="accented">when thou puttest her away</span>, <span class="accented">thou wilt contend with her</span>; <span class="accented">he sighed with his keen breath in the day of the east wind</span>. "In measure" means "with forbearance and moderation" - the punishment being carefully adjusted to the degree of the offence. God was about to "put Judah away" - to banish her into a far country; but still he would refrain himself  - he would "not suffer his whole displeasure to arise," or give her over wholly to  destruction. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the east wind</span>, or of the national catastrophe, when his breath was fierce and hard against his people, he would "sigh" at the needful chastisement. As Dr. Kay well says, "Amid the rough and stern severity which he breathed into the tempest, there was an undertone of sadness and grief." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a></div><div class="verse">By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this <i>is</i> all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By this</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "by the punishment inflicted." God accepts punishment as an expiation of sin; and this punishment of Judah was especially intended to be expiatory, and to remove at once his guilt, and the evil temper which had led him into sin. Its fruit would be a revulsion from idolatry, which would show itself in a fierce determination to destroy all idolatrous emblems and implements, <span class="cmt_word">altars, groves,</span> <span class="cmt_word">images</span>, and the like. This spirit was strongly shown in the Maccabee period (see 1 Macc. 5:44, 68 1 Macc. 10:84 1 Macc. 13:47, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones</span>. A calcining of the stones into lime is probably intended. It was usual to subject the idolatrous objects to the action of fire, and then to stamp them into powder (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4, 6, 11, 12, 15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The groves and images</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3</a>; and see the comment on Isaiah 17:8).

By a sudden introduction of metaphor, the city becomes a tree, the prophet's thought going back, perhaps, to ver. 6. "Withered boughs" are indications of internal rottenness, and must be "broken off" to give the tree a chance of recovery. Samaria may be viewed as such a "bough," if the "tree" be taken as "the Israel of God" in the wider sense. Otherwise, we must suppose a threat against individual Judaeans. <span class="cmt_word">The women come.</span> Weak women are strong enough to break off dead branches; they fall at a touch, and "their end is to be burned" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For it is a people of no understanding.</span> It was folly, madness, to turn away from Jehovah, and go after other gods. Only through having "no understanding" could Israel have been so foolish (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-28.htm">Deuteronomy 32:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that made them... he that formed them</span> (scrap. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43</a>. ], 7). God "hateth nothing that he has made" (Collect for Ash Wednesday).
