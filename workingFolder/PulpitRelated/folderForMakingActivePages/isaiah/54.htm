There is no close connection between this chapter and the last, or even between this section and the preceding. Vers. 1-5 take up the thought of <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19-21</a>, and expand it. Israel is assured of a great enlargement of her numbers, and bidden to rejoice thereat. She is then further comforted with a   promise that she shall never be forsaken (vers. 6-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing, O barren</span>. Israel in captivity is addressed as "barren," because, in the time of suffering, her numbers rather diminished than increased. Still, she is bidden to "sing" on account of the prospect that is opening upon her. She that is now desolate and solitary will soon have more children than she formerly had, when she was a married wife, enjoying the fellowship of Jehovah, her Husband (ver. 5). The "children" spoken of are in part those who gathered themselves together in Jerusalem and the adjacent territory after the issue of the decree of Cyrus (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2-34</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1-65</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1-20</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6-72</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3-36</a>), but mainly such as flocked in from the Gentiles, both before and after Christ's coming (see ver. 3).

The memory of the old nomadic life caused the "tent" to be the symbol and representative of the dwelling-place (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>). Israel will have so many more children that her "tent" will need enlarging. The curtains; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tent-cloth (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a> and 36, where the word used occurs repeatedly). <span class="cmt_word">Thy cords...  thy stakes</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/35-18.htm">Exodus 35:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-40.htm">Exodus 39:40</a>, etc.). The ropes and tent-pegs, which kept the tent-cloth in place, are intended. The enlargement of the tent would make longer ropes and larger pegs necessary.

The Christian Church is viewed as a continuation of the Jewish Church; and the conversion of nation after nation to the gospel is regarded as the extension of Jewish dominion over fresh lands. The cities of these lands - desolate hitherto, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without godly inhabitants - will under these circumstances come to be inhabited; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will be peopled by faithful men.

The "shame" of this period was 'the Egyptian bondage. Israel's later condition would be such that the very recollection of this bondage would fade away and cease. <span class="cmt_word">The reproach of thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">widowhood.</span> Israel became a "widow" when Jehovah withdrew his presence from her, when the Shechinah disappeared from the temple, and the temple itself was destroyed, and Jerusalem was a desolation, and the people captives in a far land. The special "reproach of her widowhood" was the Babylonian captivity, with the sins that had brought it about. This too would be forgotten in the good time to come, amid the glories of the Messianic kingdom.

"I," says the prophet, "have called thee married and widowed, thereby yoking thee to a husband, <span class="accented">for</span> thou hast a Husband, namely, thy Maker." (The Hebrew has both words in the plural, to accord with the following <span class="accented">Elohim.</span>) This relationship of God to his Church is often asserted by the prophets (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-4.htm">Song of Solomon 1:4</a>, etc.), and lies at the root of the oft-recurring metaphor by which idolatry is called "lewdness," "adultery," or "playing the whore<span class="cmt_word">." Thy Redeemer the Holy One</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thy Redeemer is the Holy One.</span> (On the title itself, see the comment on Isaiah 1:4.) <span class="cmt_word">The God of the whole earth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>:18, etc.). Materially, he was always this. Now, from this time, he will be "God of the whole earth" morally; not God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles (see <a href="../../par/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath called thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> recalled thee to himself - summoned thee to return, and once more resume the office of a wife<span class="cmt_word">.

The sixty or seventy years of the Captivity were but as a moment of time compared with the long ages during which God had tenderly watched over and protected his Church, and, still more, compared with the eternity during which he was now about to show himself her constant Guardian and Protector. There had been a little wrath; or rather, <span class="accented">one burst of wrath</span>; and then Mercy had resumed her sway. The face hid for a moment had been allowed once more to shine upon the afflicted people; and the momentary indignation would be followed by, and swallowed up in, ever-lasting  kindness (compare above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, "His anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning").

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/54-9.htm">Isaiah 54:9</a></div><div class="verse">For this <i>is as</i> the waters of Noah unto me: for <i>as</i> I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is as the waters of Noah unto me</span>. The existing calamity - Israel submerged in the flood of Babylonian captivity-is as it were a repetition of the calamity of the Deluge in God's eyes. Its object is to purify his Church, as the object of the Flood was to purify the world. A righteous household survived in the one case; a righteous remnant would go forth in the other. And as God bound himself in Noah's time not to repeat the calamity of the Deluge, so now he binds himself not again to submerge his Church in a captivity like the Babylonian. It has been said that the promise was not kept, since the Jewish Church was, in A.D. , carried captive by the Romans. But the prophet views the Jewish Church as continued in the Christian, into which all its better and more spiritual members passed at the first preaching of the gospel; and the promise here made is thus parallel to that of our Lord, "Upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). Much as the Christian Church has suffered from the world, it has never been in like cases with the Jewish Church in Babylon, and, as God is faithful, never will be reduced to such extremity. <span class="cmt_word">As I have sworn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pledged myself." It does not appear from <a href="../../par/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20-22</a> or Genesis 9:8-17 that God actually bound himself by oath. <span class="cmt_word">So have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee</span>. That is to say, not to the same extent, not so as to visit her with the same punishment.

Hitherto Israel has been addressed; now the direct object of address is Jerusalem. The eye of the prophet passes, however, with a glance, from the actual present to the far-distant future, and sees the Zion of God in her heavenly setting, all bedecked with precious stones, as she was seen by the exile of Patmos more than seven centuries later (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16-21</a>). After briefly describing the heavenly city, he passes to her inhabitants, and promises them peace, protection, and righteousness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O thou afflicted</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14-17</a>). Jerusalem is seen as she was during the Captivity - "afflicted" by God's hand, vexed with all his storms, and not yet comforted (Comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a>). Then a fresh vision obliterates the mournful sight. <span class="cmt_word">I will lay thy stones with fair colours</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I will lay thy stones in antimony</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will give them a setting and adornment like that which beautiful women were in the habit of giving to their eyes when they wished to attract admiration (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>). <span class="accented">Puk</span>, or antimony, was used to stain both the upper and the under eyelid, in order to increase the apparent lustre of the eye, and so impart to it greater beauty. The passage is not to be understood as implying that coloured marbles were ever really set in antimony. <span class="cmt_word">And lay thy foundations with sapphires</span>; or, <span class="accented">make thy foundations of sapphires.</span> In Revelation the <span class="accented">first</span> foundation is "jasper," the <span class="accented">second</span> "sapphire" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>). Sapphire was the foundation on which the throne of God appeared to be set, when it was seen by Moses, Aaron, and the seventy elders (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>). The throne itself had the appearance of sapphire, as seen by Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>).

So far forth as men are true Christians, does peace   reign in the conscience and show itself in the life. Externally there may be persecution, tumult, wars, fightings; but internally, in each heart, there will be a "peace that passes all understanding" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).
