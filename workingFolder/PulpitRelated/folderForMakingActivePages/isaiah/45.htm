This direct address of God to a heathen king is without a parallel in Scripture. Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Abimelech, were warned through dreams. Nebuchadnezzar was even promised Divine aid (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24, 25</a>). But no heathen monarch had previously been personally addressed by God, much less called "his anointed," and spoken to <span class="accented">by his name</span> (ver. 4). Three motives are mentioned for this special favour to him: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he might acknowledge Jehovah to be the true God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Israel might be benefited and advantaged by him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the attention of the whole world might be attracted, and the unity of God made manifest far and wide (vers. 3-6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord to his anointed</span>. The "anointed of Jehovah" is elsewhere always either an Israelite king, or the expected Deliverer of the nation, "Messiah the Prince" (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>). This Deliverer, however, was to be of the line of David (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), and of the city of Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), so that we can scarcely suppose Isaiah to have seen him in Cyrus. But he may have seen in Cyrus a type of the great Deliverer, as he saw in the release of Israel from the power of Babylon a type of their deliverance from sin. <span class="cmt_word">Whose right hand I have holden</span>; rather, <span class="accented">strengthened</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To subdue nations before him</span> (see above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). Among the nations subdued by Cyrus may be mentioned the Medes, the Babylonians, the Lydians, the Caftans, the Caunians, the Lycians, the Bactrians, the Sacae, the Parthians, the Hyrcanians, the Chorasmians, the Sogdians, the Arians of Herat, the Zarangians, the Arachosians, the Satagydians, and the Gandarians. <span class="cmt_word">I will loose the loins of kings</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. render them weak and incapable of resistance" (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>), net "disarm them" (Cheyne); for the chief royal weapons were the spear and the bow, neither of which was carried at the girdle. To open before him the two-leaved gates. The cities and forts repro-sented on the Assyrian monuments have invariably their gateways closed by two large gates or doors which meet in the centre of the gateway. The bronze plating found at Ballarat gave the dimensions, and showed the strength of such gates ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archseol.,' vol. 7. pp. 83-88). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a></div><div class="verse">I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will...  make the crooked places straight</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">will make the rugged places level.</span> No doubt intended generally, "I will smooth his way before him." <span class="cmt_word">The gates of brass...  the bars of iron</span>. According to Herodotus, the gates of Babylon were of solid bronze, and one hundred in number (1:179). Solid bronze gates have, however, nowhere been found, and would have been inconvenient from their enormous weight. It is probable that the "gates of brass," or "bronze," whereof we read, were always, like these found at Ballarat, of wood plated with bronze. <span class="accented">To the eye</span> these would be "gates of bronze." Gates of towns were, as a matter of course, secured by bars, which would commonly be made of iron, as the strongest material. Iron was well known to the Babylonians (Herod., 1:186). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call <i>thee</i> by thy name, <i>am</i> the God of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give thee the treasures of darkness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "treasures stored in dark places" - "bidden treasures." Treasuries were built for greater security without windows. Of the treasures which fell into the hands of Cyrus, the greatest were probably those of Babylon (Herod., 1:183) and of Sardis (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:2, &sect; 11). The value of the latter has been estimated at above one hundred and twenty-six millions sterling. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest know</span>; or, <span class="accented">acknowledge</span> (for the actual acknowledgment, see the decrees in <a href="../../par/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a> and Ezra 6:3-5). If these documents are accepted as genuine, or even as true in substance (Ewald), Cyrus must be considered to have identified Jehovah with his own Ormuzd, and to have viewed the Jewish and Persian religions as substantially the same. He would be under no temptation, with so weak and down-trodden a people as the Jews, to resort to politic pretences, as he might be in the case of the Babylonians (see the comment on Isaiah 41:25). <span class="cmt_word">Which call thee by thy name</span> (comp. ver. 1 and <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). (On the special favour implied in God's condescending to "know" or "call" a person by his name, see the 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus 33:12.) Am the God of Israel; rather, am the Lord...  <span class="accented">the God of Israel.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a></div><div class="verse">For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Jacob my servant's sake</span>. This second motive is, in a certain sense, the main one. Cyrus is raised up, especially, to perform God's pleasure with respect to Judah and Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26-28</a>). Jacob, his Church, is more important in God's eyes than any individual. No doubt his Church is maintained, in part, that it  may be "a light to lighten the Gentiles;" but it is not maintained solely: or even mainly, for this end. Its welfare is an end in itself, and would be sought by God apart from any further consequence. <span class="cmt_word">Israel mine elect</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have surnamed thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "given thee designations of honour," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "my anointed" (ver. 1); "my shepherd" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>); "he who shall do all my pleasure" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Though thou hast not known me; rather, <span class="accented">though thou didst not know me.</span> Cyrus's honours, his titles, his mention by name, etc., were accumulated upon him before his birth, when he knew nothing of God, when, therefore, he had in no way merited them. Thus all was done, not for his sake, but lot the sake of Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am</i> the LORD, and <i>there is</i> none else, <i>there is</i> no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I girded thee</span>. As God "loosed the loins" of Cyrus's adversaries (ver. 1), to weaken them, so he "girded" those of Cyrus, to give him strength (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a></div><div class="verse">That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that <i>there is</i> none beside me. I <i>am</i> the LORD, and <i>there is</i> none else.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may know from the rising of the sun</span>. Here we have the third motive of the Divine action respecting Cyrus. The attention of all the world from the extreme east to the extreme west, would be drawn by the wonderful occurrences. Jehovah's hand in them would be perceived, and his sole Godhead would obtain acknowledgment. An impulse was doubtless given to monotheism by the victories of Cyrus and the favour which he showed the Jews; but it cannot be said to have been very marked. Idolatry and polytheism were to a certain extent discredited; but they maintained their ground nevertheless. It was not till the true "Anointed One" appeared - the antitype of whom Cyrus was the type - that the idols were "utterly abolished." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a></div><div class="verse">I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these <i>things</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I form the light, and create darkness</span>. It has been recently denied that there is any allusion in these words, or in those which follow, to the Zoroastrian tenets; and it has even been asserted that the religion of the early Achaemenian kings was free from the taint of dualism. But according to some authorities, "a god of lies" is mentioned in the Behistun inscription; and the evidence is exceedingly strong that dualism was an essential part of the Zoroastrian religion long before the time of Cyrus (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 332, 333, 2nd edit.). It is quite reasonable to suppose that Isaiah would be acquainted with the belief of the Persians and Medes, who had come in contact with the Assyrians as early as B.C.. 830; and a warning against the chief error of their religion would be quite in place when he was holding up Cyrus to his countrymen as entitled to their respect and veneration. The <span class="accented">nexus</span> of the words, "I am the Lord, <span class="accented">and there is none else. I form the light</span>, <span class="accented">and create darkness</span>," is such as naturally to suggest an intended antagonism to the Zoroastrian system. Under that, Ormuzd created "light" and "peace," Ahriman "darkness" and "evil." The two were eternal adversaries, engaged in an inter-ruinable contest. Ormuzd, it is true, claimed the undivided allegiance of mankind, since he was their maker; but Ahriman was a great power, terribly formidable - perhaps a god (<span class="accented">diva</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> certainly the chief of the devas. It was from Zoroastrianism that Manicheism derived its doctrine of the two principles, and to the same source may, with much probability, be traced the "devil-worshippers" of the Zagros mountain chain.

Apparently, Isaiah anticipates that the Israelites will be discontented and murmur at their deliverer being a heathen king, and not one of their own body. He therefore warns them against presuming to criticize the arrangements of the All-Wise, reminding them of his unapproachable greatness (ver. 12), and once more assuring them  that the appointment of Cyrus is from him (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!</span> Let the potsherd strive, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">woe unto him that striveth with his Maker</span>, <span class="accented">a potsherd among potsherds of the ground</span>: All men are equally made of "the dust of the ground" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Israel has no prerogative in this respect. He, too, is "a potsherd among potsherds"  - day moulded by the potter; no more entitled to lift up his voice against his Maker than the vessel to rebel against the man who shapes it (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; and see the comment furnished by St. Paul in the Epistle to the <a href="../../par/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-24</a>). What would a man think if the clay that he was fashioning objected to being moulded in a particular form, or if a work that he had made exclaimed, "He is a poor bungler - he hath no hands"? Yet this is what a man does who finds fault with the arrangements of the Almighty.

In Greece a fixed sum was established by general consent as the ransom of a captive (Aristot., 'Eth. Nic.,' 5:6). Cyrus, however, in letting the Jews go free, would not be actuated by the paltry motive of pecuniary profit. He <span class="accented">may</span>, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, have been actuated in part "by a consideration of the usefulness of such a faithful advanced guard at the border of Egypt;" but <span class="accented">mainly</span> it is probable that "he obeyed the dictates of religious sympathy with the Jews."

"With the prospect of the release of the exiles is associated," says Delitzsch, "in the prophet's perspective, the prospect of an expansion of the restored Church, through the entrance of the fulness of the Gentiles." Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saba are especially mentioned here, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>, as among the first to come in (vers. 14, 15). Later on, a more general influx is spoken of (ver. 20); and, finally, a prospect is held out of an ultimate universal conversion (ver. 23). At the same time, judgment is denounced against the idolaters who persist in their idolatry (vers. 16, 20), and they are warned that they will have no share in the coming glories of the Israel of God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The labour of Egypt</span>, and  <span class="cmt_word">merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabaeans</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the laborious Egyptians, and the traffic-loving Ethiopians and Sabaeans."

Knobel understands that they would give their aid to the rebuilding of the temple; but this they certainly did not do, and Isaiah's words certainly do not imply it.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a></div><div class="verse">I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in a place of the land of darkness.</span> Jehovah's oracles have not been given, like those of the necromancers, or those of the heathen gods, in dark places of the earth - caves like that of Trophonius (Pansan., 9:29, &sect; 2), or the inmost recesses (<span class="accented">adyta</span>) of temples; but openly on Sinai, or by the mouth of prophets who proclaimed his words to all Israel (romp. Dent. 30:11-14, "This commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off<span class="cmt_word">... </span> . But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it"). So our Lord says of his own teaching, "I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and <span class="accented">in secret have I said nothing"</span> (<a href="../../par/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). Seek ye me in vain; rather, <span class="accented">seek ye me as a chaos</span> (romp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>, where God says to his people, "Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness?"). God has no more revealed himself to his people as chaotic, confused, disordered, than he has presented the world to them in this condition.! the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. There is an allusion to the crooked and ambiguous utterances of the heathen oracles, which rarely gave direct answers or plainly expressed any definite meaning. God in his utterances never diverges from the straight line of righteousness and truth (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a></div><div class="verse">Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye <i>that are</i> escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god <i>that</i> cannot save.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Assemble yourselves and come...  ye...  escaped of the nations</span>. The prophet reverts to the main idea of the section, which is the conversion of the Gentiles, and calls on all "the escaped of the nation" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who have survived the judgments of the time - to "assemble and come," to consider the claims of Jehovah to be the only true God, to "look to him (ver. 22) and be saved." The great judgments through which the heathen will be brought to God have been frequently mentioned (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-33</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1-10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11, 12, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13-15</a>, etc.). They must not be regarded as limited to the time of Cyrus, but rather as continuing  into the Messianic period, and indeed nearly to its close (see especially ch. 34.). Each one of them constitutes a call to the nations, and is followed by a conversion to a greater or less extent. <span class="cmt_word">They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who lift up</span> (or, carry) <span class="accented">the wood of their graven image</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>, "They bear him upon the shoulder," where the same verb is used). It was a practice of the idolatrous heathen to carry the images of their gods in processions, generally exposed to view upon their shoulders (Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2. opp. p. 451), but sometimes partially concealed in shrines, or "arks" (Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 100, 101). There would be still among the "escaped" some who would so act. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21</a></div><div class="verse">Tell ye, and bring <i>them</i> near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? <i>who</i> hath told it from that time? <i>have</i> not I the LORD? and <i>there is</i> no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; <i>there is</i> none beside me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell ye, and bring them near</span>. Dr. Kay and Mr. Cheyne understand the nations to be addressed, and told to "show" or "announce," and "bring forth" or "produce," any argument in favour of the divinity of their gods. But it is simpler and better, with our translators, to regard the address as made to the prophets of God, who are bidden to announce his message of mercy to the nations, and to bring them near to him (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let them take counsel together</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let the nations consider one with another, whether God or the idols be the fitter object of worship. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath declared this?</span> "This" must refer to the conquest of Babylon and deliverance of Israel by Cyrus. None but Jehovah had ever announced this - none but he could bring it to pass<span class="cmt_word">. From ancient time</span>; rather, from <span class="accented">aforetime</span> (Cheyne). The announcement cannot have been made very long before this prophecy was delivered. <span class="cmt_word">A just God and a Saviour</span>. A God in whom "mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss each other" (Psalm 85:16); who can be at once just, "acting stringently according to the demands of his holiness" (Delitzsch), and yet design and effect the salvation of sinners.

"God swears "by himself," because he can swear by no greater" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>). He condescends, for man's sake, to confirm in this way promises that are exceedingly precious (see the Homiletics on Isaiah 14:24). <span class="cmt_word">The word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness</span>. So Dr. Kay and Mr. Cheyne (comp. ver. 19, "I the Lord speak righteousness"). And shall not return; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall not be withdrawn or retracted. God's gifts and promises are "without repentance." <span class="cmt_word">Every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear</span>.
