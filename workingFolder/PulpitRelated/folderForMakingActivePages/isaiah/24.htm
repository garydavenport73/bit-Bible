From special denunciations of woe upon particular nations - Baby-loll, Assyria, Philistia, Moab, Syria of Damascus, Egypt and Ethiopia, Arabia, Judea, Tyre - the prophet passes to denunciations of a broader character, involving the future of the whole world. This section of his work extends from the commencement of <a href="../../par/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>. to the conclusion of <a href="../../par/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27</a>, thus including four chapters. The world at large is the general subject of the entire prophecy; but the "peculiar people" still maintains a marked and prominent place, as spiritually the leading country, and as one in whose fortunes the world at large would be always vitally concerned (see especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6, 9, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty</span>. Several critics (Lowth, Ewald, Gesenius, Knobel) prefer to render, "maketh the <span class="accented">land</span> empty;" but the broader view, which is maintained by Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kay, Cheyne, and others, seems preferable. The mention of "the world" in ver. 4, and of "the-kings of the earth" in ver. 21, implies a wider field of survey than the Holy Land. Of course the expression, "maketh empty," is rhetorical, some remarkable, but not complete, depopulation being pointed at (comp. ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">Turneth it upside down</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Scattereth abroad the inhabitants</span>.

All shall suffer equally. The author is obliged to take as examples distinctions of rank known to him; but he carefully selects such as are of almost universal occurrence. There was scarcely any nation of antiquity in which there were not "priests and people," "masters and slaves," "buyers and sellers," "lenders and borrowers," "takers and givers of usury." By "usury" is meant, not exorbitant interest, but interest simply, of whatever amount.

For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.., all these are the beginning of sorrows" (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6-8</a>).

All the great are brought down, and laid low, that "the Lord alone may be exalted in that day" (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-17</a>).

Hitherto the prophet has been concerned with the mere fact of a terrible judgment to be sent by God upon the whole world. Now he sets forth the cause of the fact. It is the old cause, which has reduced so many lauds to desolation, and which in the far-off times produced the Flood, viz. the wickedness of man (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-13</a>). The earth is "defiled" or "polluted" by the sins of its inhabitants, and has to be purged from the defilement by suffering. <span class="cmt_word">They have transgressed the laws</span>. Apart from both Judaism and Christianity, all mankind have been placed by God under a double law: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The "law written in their hearts" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>), which speaks to them through their consciences, and lays them under an obligation that cannot be gainsaid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The law of positive commands, given to the entire human race through the common progenitors, Adam and Noah, which is obligatory upon all to whom it has been traditionally handed down; but which has been only very partially handed down, and it is not generally felt as obligatory. Mankind has in all ages largely transgressed both laws, and both would seem to be pointed at in the present passage. The transgression of the "law written in the heart" is doubtless that which especially calls down God's vengeance, and makes him from time to time execute wrath on the whole world. Changed the ordinance; rather, <span class="accented">broken</span>, <span class="accented">violated</span>. Transgression in act is intended, not formal abrogation of the Divine ordinances. Broken the everlasting covenant. Mr. Cheyne supposes an allusion to the covenant made with Noah (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-16.htm">Genesis 9:16</a>); but it seems better to understand that "everlasting covenant" which exists between God and man, in virtue of the nature wherewith God has endowed man, and of the laws which he Ires impressed upon man's con. science.

Men will still drink; they will seek to drown their care in wine; but they will not have the heart to attempt a song as they drink. Even in their cups they will be silent. <span class="cmt_word">Strong drink shall be bitter</span>. By "strong drink" (<span class="accented">shekar</span>) seems to be meant any intoxicating liquor whatever, including wine. Many such liquors were drunk in Palestine (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 458, 459). All were more or less pleasant to the taste; but they would taste bitter to those who were warped and soured by the calamities of the time, which would prevent all enjoyment.

Wine, though still manufactured (see vers. 7, 9) is scarce, but is much sought after. Men clamor for it at the doors of the wine-shops, but are unable to obtain it. They crave for its exhilarating effects, or perhaps for the oblivion which it brings when drunk to excess. If they could obtain it, they would act as the Jews in the siege of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). But they cannot. Hence even the factitious merriment, which wine is capable of producing, is denied now to the inhabitants of the earth, with whom <span class="cmt_word">all joy is darkened</span>, from whom <span class="cmt_word">all mirth is gone</span>.

The thought of this joyful time, when the saints shall reign with their Lord in a new heaven and a new earth, recalls the prophet (contrast being one of the laws of the association of ideas) to the misery of the present, and his own participation therein. A time of suffering, of wasting, and pining away must be endured - for how long he knows not - before the joyous consummation, towards which he stretches in hope and confident expectancy, can be reached.

The spirits here spoken of must belong to the class of fallen spirits  - they must be included among those "principalities and powers," of whom St. Paul speaks (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>), whom he calls "the rulers of the darkness of this world," and to whom he ascribes "spiritual wickedness in high places." The punishment of such spirits is, perhaps, shadowed forth in the eighty-second psalm; it was distinctly taught in the Book of Enoch; and it is glanced at by St. Jude in his Epistle (ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And the kings</span>. Kings, especially kings in the Oriental sense, have an enormous influence over the nations which they govern, and therefore a heavy responsibility. The kings of the nations are viewed here as having brought about the general corruption and wickedness which has necessitated the destruction of the earth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/24-22.htm">Isaiah 24:22</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall be gathered together, <i>as</i> prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the pit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in a dungeon</span>. Mr. Cheyne suggests that <span class="accented">sheol</span>, or "hell," is meant; but the context points to some narrower confinement. <span class="cmt_word">In the prison</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in prison</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After many days</span>. In the Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>) Satan is bound "a thousand years;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an indefinite term. The imprisonment of the present passage is scarcely the same, but it is analogous. God's purposes require sometimes long periods of inaction. <span class="cmt_word">Shall they be visited</span>; or, <span class="accented">published</span>. The word is the same as that translated "punish" in ver. 21. "Visiting" for good is scarcely to be thought of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a></div><div class="verse">Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed</span>. Some interpret this in the light of <a href="../../par/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, as pointing to that physical change, real or phenomenal, in the shining of the sun and moon, which is to be one of the antecedent signs of Christ's coming at the last day. But the expressions used suggest rather a contrast between the dazzling splendor of Christ's actual appearance and the normal brightness of sunlight and moonlight. The greater and lesser lights will "pale their ineffectual fires" before the incomparable brightness of the "Sun of Righteousness" (<a href="../../par/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem</span>. The spiritual Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem can alone be meant, since the earth is no more (ver. 20). (On these, see <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21, 22</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Before his ancients</span>; or, <span class="accented">his elders</span>. Four and twenty elders, clothed in white raiment, with crowns of gold upon their heads, are represented in the Apocalypse as sitting round about the throne of God perpetually (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>), and worshipping God and the Lamb (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-10.htm">Revelation 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8, 14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
