Isaiah returns to the standpoint of <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9-11</a>. A deliverer of Israel is about to appear. The nations are therefore summoned to attend, and consider the facts (ver. 1). He will carry all before him (vers 2, 3), being raised up by God (ver. 4). The nations will tremble, and seek the protection of their idol-deities (vers. 5-7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep silence before me, O islands</span>. God is the speaker. The "islands," or maritime lands of Western Asia, are to be silent before him, pondering the facts with a view to future argument.

Cyrus, whether we regard him as King of Persia, or as King of Elam (Susiana), would come from a land lying <span class="accented">east</span> of Babylon. "Righteousness called him to his foot" when God, the Righteous One, made him his minister, and gave him a certain task to perform (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gave the nations before him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">gives</span>, or <span class="accented">will give.</span> (On the rapid conquests of Cyrus, see Herod., 1:75-191; and comp.

That he was God's instrument must be admitted by all who allow that the course of history is determined by a superintending Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Made him rule over kings</span>. Mr. Cheyne translates, "makes him trample upon kings," which seems to give the true sense. It was certainly not the general policy of Cyrus to establish under him a number of subject kings, but rather to rule the conquered countries by means of Persian or Median governors (see Herod., 1:153, 156; 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 166) <span class="cmt_word">He gave them as the dust to his sword</span>, etc.; or, according to some, <span class="accented">he maketh their sword as dust</span>, <span class="accented">and their bow as driven stubble.</span> The result is the same, whichever we regard as the true construction. The prophecy tells of the ease and completeness with which Cyrus vanquished his enemies.

Compare the frequent boasts of the Assyrian kings: "To the recesses of the deep forests and the peaks of the difficult mountains, <span class="accented">which had never been trodden by the foot of man</span>, I ascended' ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 13). "Difficult mountain chains, and <span class="accented">inaccessible hills</span>, which none of our kings had ever previously reached  - tedious paths and <span class="accented">unopened roads -</span> I traversed" (ibid., p. 16).

He is my work; I, Jehovah, that have called (into being) the generations (of man) from the beginning (of the world) - I, Jehovah, the First, and with the last, am  he that he has done this thing. By "the First, and with the last" - a favourite phrase in these later chapters (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a> and Isaiah 48:12) - seems to be meant simply "the Eternal" (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8, 11, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>).

A general terror seized the nations on the conquest of the Medes by Cyrus. Croesus of Lydia, Nabonidus of Babylon, and Amasis of Egypt, were at once drawn together by the common danger, and made alliance offensive and defensive (Herod., 1:77). The weaker tribes and peoples gave themselves up for lost. Scarcely any resistance seems to have been offered to the Persian arms by the tribes between the Halys and Indus, the Jaxartes and the Indian Ocean. Lydia and Babylon alone made a stout fight; but even these were conquered without very much difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">The ends of the earth...  drew near</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> distant nations held (will hold) consultation together on the danger which threatens them. The league of Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt is the only known instance of such "drawing near" (see the preceding note). Isaiah anticipates marked consultations and exhortations with respect to the idol-gods, in which trust should be put; but perhaps he is scarcely serious in vers. 6, 7. Rather he is indulging his sarcastic humour at the expense of the idols and of those who put their trust in them. (For instances, however, of actual trust in particular idols, see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 4. p. 58; Herod., 5:67; 8:64,)

Each encourages the others to manufacture a right good god. When all is done, there is, however, need of soldering, and of nails, that the wretched object may be kept erect, and not show its weakness by falling, like Dagon, upon its own threshold (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>).

The eye of the prophet travels perhaps, in part, beyond the period of the Captivity; but he is mainly bent on giving the people grounds of comfort and trust during that trying time. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel...   my servant</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1, 2, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3-6</a>, etc.). The title characterizes these later chapters, and, while standing no doubt in some special relation to the "Servant of Jehovah" who is the subject of <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5-7</a>, etc., is perhaps mainly selected, and dwelt on, to console Israel in captivity, when <span class="accented">servants</span> of the King of Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-20.htm">2 Chronicles 36:20</a>), by the thought that their true Master was God himself, and that to him, and him only, did they really belong. <span class="cmt_word">Jacob whom I have chosen</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a>). (On this "choice," and the love which it implied, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>) Abraham my friend; or, <span class="accented">Abraham that loved me.</span> It was the special privilege of Abraham to be known as God's friend (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>) among the Hebrews, even as he is among the Arabs to this day. The "friendship" intended comprised, no doubt, both an active and a passive element, but it is the active element which the word principally enforces. Abraham loved God, and showed his love by his obedience.

This verse is most closely connected with the two preceding. The clauses in vers. 8, 9 are one and all vocative; here the verb follows. The whole passage is one of great tenderness. I am with thee (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6, 8</a>; and see above (vol. 1, p. 132), on the force of the word" Immanuel"). <span class="cmt_word">I will strengthen thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I have strengthened thee</span>, or I <span class="accented">have chosen thee</span> (Delitzsch, Cheyne). The two other verbs are also in the past tense. While primarily they declare past favours, they may also be regarded as prophetic of future ones, since "with God is no variableness.'

The order is one of climax. Similarly, with each augmentation of the hostility there is an augmentation of the sentence of punishment - "shall be covered with shame;" "shall perish;" "shall not be found;" "shall become as nothingness."

The argument is now taken up from vers. 1-4. Jehovah and his worshippers are on the one side; the idol-gods and their votaries on the other. The direct challenge, however, is given by Jehovah himself to the idols: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> What predictions of their own can they bring forward as proofs of supernatural knowledge? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> What indications can they give of power either to do good or to do evil (vers. 22, 23)? If they can do neither, they are vanity (ver. 24). Jehovah has both reared up Cyrus he and he only - and has announced the good tidings to his people (vers. 25-27). No such announcement has been made by the idol-gods; they are therefore mere "wind and confusion" (vers. 28, 29). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Produce your cause</span>. The nations had been told to "draw near" - to "keep silence" while God spoke - and "then to speak" (ver. 1). Now the time for them to speak is come, and they are challenged to "<span class="accented">produce"</span> and plead "their cause." Your strong reasons; literally, <span class="accented">your bulwarks</span>, or <span class="accented">defences.</span> Saith the King of Jacob. The king and tutelary god of the nation, Israel, really holding the position that the idol-gods were regarded as holding towards the peoples that worshipped them. The "kingly" character of the idol-gods was indicated in such names as Moloch (equivalent to "king"), Melkarth (equivalent to "king of the city"), Adrammelech (equivalent to "glorious king"), Baal (equivalent to "lord"), Adonis (equivalent to "my lord"), etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a></div><div class="verse">Let them bring <i>them</i> forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they <i>be</i>, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them...  show us what will happen</span>. God claims that the power of predicting the future is his own inalienable prerogative. He defies the idol-gods and their votaries to give any clear prediction of future events. No doubt the claim to possess the power was made very generally among the idolatrous nations, who almost universally practised divination, and in many case<span class="accented">s</span> possessed oracles. But it was a false claim, based upon fraud and cunning, which deceived men as often as dependence was placed upon it (Herod., 1:53, 91) and landed them in misfortune. <span class="cmt_word">The former things...  things for to come.</span> Some commentators regard "the former things" as things actually past - "the beginnings of history, for instance, which to the heathen nations were wrapped in darkness" (Kay); but it seems better, on the whole, to understand (with Vitringa, Stier, Hahn, Cheyne, and Delitzsch) by "the former things" those in the immediate future, by "things for to come" those about to happen in remoter times. The former are, of course, much the easier to predict, since they fall to some extent within the domain of human foresight; the latter are more difficult; but the idol-gods are challenged to produce either the one or the other. <span class="cmt_word">What they be</span>. A definite and clear statement is required to preclude such vague and ambiguous utterances as the heathen oracles delighted to put forth. <span class="cmt_word">That we may consider them</span> (or, <span class="accented">lay them to heart</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and know the latter end of them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> compare them with the event, when the time comes.

Here the proof required of the idol-gods is changed. If they cannot prophesy, can they effect anything? Can they do either good or harm? Let them show this.

But they are stricken dumb; they say nothing. Accordingly, "judgment goes against them by default" (Cheyne), and Jehovah breaks out upon them with words of contempt and contumely, <span class="cmt_word">Behold, ye are of nothing</span>, etc. "Ye are utterly vain and futile." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a></div><div class="verse">I have raised up <i>one</i> from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as <i>upon</i> morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - It remains for Jehovah to plead his own cause, to vindicate his own Divinity. He adduces, as proof of his power in action, the fact of his raising up Cyrus; as proof of his ability to predict, the fact that he has announced his coming. <span class="cmt_word">One from the north...  from the rising of the sun</span>. Both as a Persian, and as King of Elam, Cyrus might be considered to come from the east. In fact, however, when he attacked Babylon, he fell upon it mainly from the north. After his conquest of Astyages (Istivegu), he made Ecbatana his capital (Herod., 1:153); and it was from this comparatively northern city that he directed his attack upon Nabonidus. His march lay by way of Arbela ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 159) and Sippara  (ibid., p. 165), through the district called Akkad to the Chaldean capital. Herodotus agrees with the monuments in bringing him to Babylon from the north. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he call upon my Name</span>; or, <span class="accented">shall he. proclaim my</span> Name. (For the actual proclamation of Jehovah's Name by Cyros, see <a href="../../par/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>; and note especially the phrase, "He [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah] is <span class="accented">the</span> God.") Recent discoveries have raised the suspicion that Cyrus was a eyncretist, who was willing to accept the chief god of any nation as identical with his own Ormuzd. But it is to be borne in 'mind that the document which has produced this impression is one issued by the priestly authorities of Babylon in their own language, and may have been quite unknown to the Persian court. Cyrus may have been a better Zoroastrian than he is represented by the priests of Merodach. The Zoroastrian religion was, as Delitzsch observes, "nearest to the Jewish religion of all the systems of heathenism" (see . Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 93-117; and comp. Pusey, 'Lectures on Daniel,' pp. 530-550). <span class="cmt_word">He shall come upon princes as upon mortar</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall tread them underfoot, mortar being commonly mixed with the feet, as was also clay for bricks and pottery (Herod., 2:36). The chief" princes" whom Cyrus is known to have conquered were Astyages of Media, Croesus of Lydia, and Nabenidus of Babylon. He was studiously mild in his treatment of royal captives, but naturally deprived them of all power.
