The words of our Lord in <a href="../../par/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>, "This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears," preclude the application of this passage to any other than the Lord himself. It is simply astonishing that some Christian commentators (Ewald, Hitzig, Knobel) have not seen the force of this argument, but, with the Jews, imagine the prophet to be speaking of his own ministry. It is contrary to the entire spirit of Isaiah's writings so to glorify himself, and specially unsuitable that, after having brought forward with such emphasis the Person of "the Servant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>), he should proceed to take his place, and to "ascribe to himself those very same official attributes which he has already set forth as characteristic features in his portrait of the predicted One" (Delitzsch). Hence most recent commentators, whatever their school of thought, have acquiesced in the patristic interpretation, which regarded the Servant of Jehovah as here speaking of himself. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">Adonai Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented">is upon me.</span> The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and one manuscript omit <span class="accented">adonai.</span> In the original announcement of "the Servant" it was stated that God had "put his Spirit upon him" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). The sanctification of our Lord's human nature by the Holy Spirit is very explicitly taught in the Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/mark/1-10.htm">Mark 1:10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1, 14, 18-21</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath anointed me</span>. The "anointing" of Jesus was that sanctification of his human nature by the Holy Spirit, which commenced in the womb of the blessed Virgin (<a href="../../par/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>), which continued   as he grew to manhood (<a href="../../par/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40, 52</a>), which was openly manifested at his baptism, and never ceased till he took his body and soul with him into heaven. Of this spiritual anointing, all material unction, whether under the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-12, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15, 16</a>, etc.) or under the gospel (<a href="../../par/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>), was symbolical or typical. <span class="cmt_word">To preach good tidings</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; and <a href="../../par/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the meek</span> (see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bind</span> <span class="cmt_word">up the broken-hearted</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>, where this is declared to be the office of Jehovah himself). "Binding up" is an ordinary expression in Isaiah's writings for "healing" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-7.htm">Isaiah 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). To proclaim liberty to the captives. This was one of the special offices of "the Servant" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>). The "captivity" intended is doubtless that of sin. <span class="cmt_word">And the opening of the prison to them that are bound</span>. St. Luke, following the Septuagint, has, "and recovering of sight to the blind." It is thought by some that the original Hebrew text has been corrupted. Others regard the Septuagint rendering as a paraphrase. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a></div><div class="verse">To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord</span>. An "acceptable year," or "year of acceptance," is a space of time during which God would be pleased to accept such as repented and turned to him. It is, of course, not intended to limit the space to a "year." The space is rather the term of our sojourn here below. <span class="cmt_word">The day of</span> <span class="cmt_word">vengeance.</span> The "day" of vengeance is contrasted with the "year" of acceptance, to indicate God's long-suffering and patience towards sinners (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>; and see also <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To comfort all that mourn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who "sorrow after a godly sort" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>) - all who mourn their transgressions and shortcomings, their "sins, negligences, and ignorances," with a hearty desire to be rid of them, and to serve God truly in the future.

Christian experience witnesses to the abundant accomplishment of all these purposes. <span class="cmt_word">That they might be called trees of righteousness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">oaks of righteousness</span>, or strong and enduring plants in the garden of God, planted by him, in order that through them <span class="cmt_word">he might be glorified</span>. Nothing gives so much glory to God as the proved righteousness of his saints. The planting of the Lord; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "which he has planted" and caused to grow, and rendered righteous. The righteousness, though it is their own, an indwelling quality, has nevertheless come from him (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - GOD'S PURPOSE OF DEALING GRACIOUSLY WITH ISRAEL. Having proclaimed the objects of his own mission, "the Servant" proceeds to declare God's gracious purposes towards Israel. Taking the Captivity period for his standpoint, he promises, first, the restoration of the cities of Judah (ver. 4), and then a flourishing time in which Jews and Gentiles shall dwell together in one community peacefully and gloriously, Israel having a certain pre-eminence (vers. 5-9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall build</span> <span class="cmt_word">the old wastes.</span> (On the "waste" condition, not of Jerusalem only, but of the cities of Judith generally, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a>, etc.) The first step in the recovery of Israel from the misery of the Captivity would be a return to Palestine, and a general restoration of the ruined towns. It was a ruin of "many generations," having commenced, probably, with the invasion of Pharaoh-Necho in  <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>, and being continued till the edict of Cyrus ( <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-5.htm">Isaiah 61:5</a></div><div class="verse">And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien <i>shall be</i> your plowmen and your vinedressers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>). The Gentiles who join themselves with the Jews, and form with them one community, are constantly represented in the writings of Isaiah as occupying a subordinate position. In the New Testament, Jew and Gentile are put upon a par. Is the explanation that Isaiah assumes that the Jews generally will accept the gospel, and therefore, to some extent, retain their privileges in the new community, whereas, in fact, they rejected the gospel, and so lost their natural position (see <a href="../../par/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7-20</a>)? Or does Isaiah look onward to a later date? And is there to be a restoration of "Israel according to the flesh" upon their conversion, and a reinstatement of them in a position of privilege? Such a condition of things seems glanced at in <a href="../../par/romans/11-23.htm">Romans 11:23-29</a>, and in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your</span> <span class="cmt_word">vinedressers.</span> Not so much compelled, like the Gibeonites (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21-27</a>), to perform menial offices, as undertaking them voluntarily out of good will. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a></div><div class="verse">But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: <i>men</i> shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye shall be named the Priests of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord.</span> By the covenant made at Sinai,   Israel was to be "a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). Had they risen to the height of their calling when our Lord and his disciples offered them salvation before offering it to the Gentiles, they might have "been in the midst of the heathen who had entered into the congregation of Jehovah and become the people of God, what the Aaronites farmerly were in the midst of Israel itself" (Delitzsch). Will they ever now obtain this position? <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall eat</span> <span class="cmt_word">the riches of the Gentiles</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-9</a> and 16). The Gentiles, when they came in, would freely offer to the Church of their substance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a></div><div class="verse">For your shame <i>ye shall have</i> double; and <i>for</i> confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For your shame ye shall have double</span>. Instead of the shame and confusion of face which were the portion of Israel during the Captivity (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-7.htm">Daniel 9:7, 8</a>, etc.), they should after their restoration to Palestine "have double" their former glory and double their former territory. An increase of territory had been already prophesied (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18-21</a>) - an increase which, however, was not so much an extension of the bounds of Palestine as a spread of the Church over the whole earth (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>). For confusion; rather, <span class="accented">as for disgrace.</span> So far from feeling disgraced, they will rejoice, or exult, in their portion; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the territory assigned them. It will be ample; and their life in it will be one of everlasting joy. The speaker passes on in his thought to the time of the "new heavens and the new earth," which he regards as continuous with that of Israel's return. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a></div><div class="verse">For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I the Lord love judgment.</span> Either "the Servant" here identifies himself with Jehovah, or he cites a declaration of Jehovah which he has authority to announce. Jehovah will restore the Israelites to their land because he "loves judgment" (equivalent to "justice") and hates injustice. The Babylonian conquest, though a judgment sent by him, is, so far as the Babylonians are concerned, a wrong and a "robbery." <span class="cmt_word">I hate</span> <span class="cmt_word">robbery for burnt offering;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I hate robbery with wickedness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7</a>; 92:16). The transplantation of nations was a gross abuse of the rights of conquest. I will direct their work in truth; rather, <span class="accented">I will give them their recompense faithfully.</span> As they have been wronged, they shall be righted; they shall be faithfully and exactly compensated for what they have suffered. Nay, more - over and above this, God will give them the blessing of an "everlasting covenant" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>).

So the Targum and Rosenmuller. Others think that "the Servant" is still speaking, or that Isaiah speaks in the name of the people. To us the exposition of the Targum appears the most satisfactory. It is in the manner of Isaiah suddenly to introduce a new speaker. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will greatly rejoice in the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a>). The promises made were such as naturally to call forth on the part of Israel the most heartfelt joy and rejoicing - including, as they did, restoration, rule over the Gentiles, a universal priesthood, a wide territory, "everlasting joy," a high renown, and an "everlasting covenant<span class="cmt_word">. He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a> and Isaiah 61:3). The metaphor occurs also in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a>). God clothes Israel with "righteousness" derived from himself (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>), and then with its natural consequence - "salvation." The result is to make Israel as a bridegroom who decketh himself with a priestly crown, and as a bride who adornoth herself with her jewels. That bridegrooms ordinarily wore crowns appears from the Mishna. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-11.htm">Isaiah 61:11</a></div><div class="verse">For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the garden</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a</span> <span class="accented">garden.</span> The Hebrew is without the article. <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness and praise</span>.
