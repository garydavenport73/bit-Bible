There is an irreconcilable difference between this note of time, in the passage as it stands, and the Assyrian inscriptions. The fourteenth year of Hezekiah was  <span class="date">B.C. 714</span> or 713. Sargon was then King of Assyria, and continued king till  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>. Sennacherib did not ascend the throne till that year, and he did not lead an expedition into Palestine till  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. Thus the date, as it stands, is cloven or twelve years too early. It is now the common opinion of critics that the chronology of the Books of Kings, speaking generally, is "a later addition to the Hebrew narrative" (Cheyne, 'Isaiah,' vol. 1. p. 199, note 1). It is uncertain when the dates were added; but it would not be long from the time when the addition was made before "<span class="accented">Isaiah"</span> would be brought into accord with "Kings." Another view is that the date belongs to the original writings, but that it has suffered corruption, "fourteenth" having been substituted for "twenty-sixth," from  an overstrict rendering of the expression, "in those days," which introduces the narrative of ch. 38. That narrative undoubtedly belongs to Hezekiah's fourteenth year. A third view is that of Dr. Hincks, who suggests a derangement of the text, which has attached to an expedition of Sennacherib a date originally belonging to an attack by Sargon. He supposes the original text to have run thus: "And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that the King of Assyria came up (against him). In those days was King Hezekiah sick unto death, etc. (ch. 38, 39.). And Sennacherib, King of Assyria, came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them," etc. (ch. 36, 37.). The subject has been treated at considerable length by Mr. Cheyne ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 1. pp. 196-204), who has accidentally ascribed to Sir H. Rawlinson the second of the above theories, which really originated with the present writer. <span class="cmt_word">Sennacherib, King of Assyria</span>. The Hebrew rendering of the name is <span class="accented">Sankherib</span>, the Greek <span class="accented">Sanacharibus</span> or <span class="accented">Senacheribus.</span> In the Assyrian the literation is <span class="accented">Sin-akhi-irib -</span> and the meaning" Sin (the moon-god) multiplies brothers." Sin-akhi-irib was the son and successor of Sargon. His father was murdered, and he ascended the throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span> (G. Smith, 'Epunym Canon,' p. 67). <span class="cmt_word">Came up against all the defenced cities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the fenced cities</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>,or "all the <span class="accented">fortified</span> cities" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And took them</span>. Sennacberib tells us that, in the campaign of his fourth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), he "captured forty-six of the strong cities" belonging to Hezekiah, King of Judah, while of the "fortresses and small cities" he took "a countless number" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134). (On the causes of the war and its general course, see the Introduction to the book.)

It is inconceivable that, immediately after the grant of terms of peace and their acceptance, Sennacherib should have renewed the war; there must have been an interval, and a fresh provocation. The interval can have been only a short one, since Hezekiah died in  <span class="date">B.C. 697</span>. It may have been a couple of years, or perhaps no more than a year, or possibly only a few months. The fresh provocation probably consisted in an application for aid, made by Hezekiah to Tir-hakah, or to the subordinate Egyptian kings, which is glanced at in ver. 6. The Assyrian annals, which never record any reverse or defeat, are wholly silent as to this second expedition. The only profane confirmation of it is to be found in Herodotus (2:141). <span class="cmt_word">From Lackish</span>. Laehish, an ancient city of the Amorites (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a>), was assigned by Joshua to the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), and seems to have been still a Jewish possession (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>). It occupied "a low round swell or knoll" in the Shefelch, or low tract between the Judaean highland and the Mediterranean, and lay near, if not directly on, the direct route which armies commonly followed in their march from Syria into Egypt. The site is now known as <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>; it lies between Gaza and <span class="accented">Ajlan</span> (Eglon), about two miles west of the hitter. Sennacherib represents himself as engaged in its siege on a bas-relief in the British Museum (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh," second series, pl. 21). <span class="cmt_word">The conduit of the upper pool</span> (see the comment on ch. 7:3). The spot was that at which Isaiah had been commanded to meet Ahaz some forty years previously. It was probably on the north side of Jerusalem, not tar from the Damascus gate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-3.htm">Isaiah 36:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eliakim: Hilkiah's son</span> (see above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a>). Eliakim had now taken the place of the Shebna who was "over the house" when Isaiah prophesied his downfall (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>) and Eliakim's advancement (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shebna the scribe</span>. It is not quite certain that this is the same "Shebna" as the former prefect of the palace, but the uncommonness of the name is a strong argument for the identity. The post of "scribe" or "secretary "(marginal rendering) was one of some importance (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>), though inferior to that of palace prefect. <span class="cmt_word">Joah... the recorder</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>, where the same three officials are mentioned in the same order). We learn from Kings that Sennacherib sent in reality three envoys (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>) to Hezekiah - the Tartan, or "commander-in-chief;" the Rabsaris, or "chief eunuch;" and the Rabshakeh, or "rab-sak," the "chief captain," the second in command after the tartan. Hezekiah thought it right to appoint an equal number of officials to meet and confer with them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-4.htm">Isaiah 36:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <i>is</i> this wherein thou trustest?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rabshakeh said.</span> Of the three Assyrian envoys Rabshakeh alone obtains mention in Isaiah, probably because he was the spokesman (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-19.htm">2 Kings 18:19, 26, 27, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>). He was probably chosen for spokesman because he could speak Hebrew fluently (<span class="accented">infra</span>, vers. 11, 13). The great king. "The great king" (<span class="accented">sarru rabbu</span>) is the most common title assumed by the Assyrian monarchs in their inscriptions. It is found as early as  <span class="date">B.C. 1120</span>.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-5.htm">Isaiah 36:5</a></div><div class="verse">I say, <i>sayest thou</i>, (but <i>they are but</i> vain words) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say</span>. In <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20</a> we read, "Thou sayest" for "I say," which gives a better sense. Dr. Kay holds the two forms to be "complementary." <span class="cmt_word">I have counsel and strength for war</span>. Either the words of Hezekiah had been reported to Sennacherib, or he rightly divined Hezekiah's thoughts. It was, no doubt, in reliance on the "counsel" of Eliakim and the "strength" of Egypt that the Jewish monarch had a second time provoked his suzerain. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a></div><div class="verse">Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This broken reed</span>; rather, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>, <span class="accented">this bruised reed</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>). A reed may be "bruised," and wholly untrustworthy as a support, while it appears sound. A "broken" reed no one would lean on. <span class="cmt_word">Egypt</span>. There had been times when Egypt was a strong power, feared and respected by her neighbours, and a terror even to Assyria. But these times were long past. For the last fifty years the country had been divided against itself (see the comment on Isaiah 19:2), split up into a number of petty principalities, Recently the neighbouring kingdom of Ethiopia had claimed and exercised a species of sovereignty over the entire Nile valley, while allowing tributary princes to govern different portions of it. Of these princes the most important at the time of Rabshakeh's embassy seems to have been Shabatok, who reigned in Memphis, probably from  <span class="date">B.C. 712</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>. Egypt is likened to a "bruised reed" on account of her untrustworthincss. "So" (Sabaco) had given no substantial help to Hashes. Shabatok was little likely to imperil himself in order to assist Hezekiah. Even Tirhakah would probably avoid, as long as he could, a conflict with the full power of Assyria. Pharaoh, King of Egypt. Sennacherib uses the generic term, "Pharaoh," instead of mentioning any of the petty princes by name, because he means to speak generally. The King of Egypt, under present circumstances, whoever he may be, is no better than a bruised reed. In his own inscriptions, Sennacherib about this time uses the expression, "the kings of Egypt" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 133, 1.47). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-7.htm">Isaiah 36:7</a></div><div class="verse">But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: <i>is it</i> not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou say to me, We trust in the Lord</span>. "The Assyrians," it has been observed, "had a good intelligence department" (Cheyne). It was known to Sennacherib that Hezekiah had a confident trust, which seemed to him wholly irrational, in Jehovah - the special God of his people. It was also known to him that Hezekiah, in the earlier portion of his reign (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), had "removed the high places" and broken down the altars, where Jehovah had for centuries been worshipped throughout the length and breadth of the land. He concludes that, in so doing, he must have offended Jehovah. He is probably ignorant of the peculiar proviso of the Jewish Law, that sacrifice should be offered in one place only, and conceives that Hezekiah has been actuated by some narrow motive, and has acted in the interests of one city only, not of the whole people. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall worship before this altar</span>. The parallel passage of 2 Kings (2 Kings 18:22) has "this altar <span class="accented">in Jerusalem."</span> The brazen altar in the great court of the temple is, of course, meant. Hezekiah had cleansed it front the pollutions of the time of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>), and had insisted on sacrifice being offered nowhere else (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-15.htm">2 Chronicles 30:15-24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>, etc.). Such a concentration of worship was unknown to any of the heathen nations, and may well have been unintelligible to them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore give pledges</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "bind yourselves under s-me penalty." Rabshakeh here interrupts his message' to introduce an offer of his own. Intent on ridiculing the absurdity of Hezekiah's resistance of Assyria, he promises to make him a present of two thousand horses, if he (Hezekiah) can find two thousand trained riders to mount them. It is quite likely that he was safe in making this promise, and that, notwithstanding the abundant use of chariots and horses by the Jews of the time for purposes of luxury (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>), they were destitute of a cavalry force and unaccustomed to the management of war-horses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a></div><div class="verse">How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How then wilt thou turn away the face</span>, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "How wilt thou be able to defeat, and <span class="accented">cause to retreat</span>, a single Assyrian captain at the head of his squadron?" <span class="cmt_word">And put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but thou trustest in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen.</span> Consciousness of the weakness, with which Rabshakeh had just reproached them, had led to their application to Egypt for a chariot and a cavalry force. Egypt was well able to furnish both, and had sent a large force of both to the help of Ekron a short time previously ('Eponym Canon,' p. 133, 11. 48-56). That force had, however, suffered defeat at the hands of Sennacherib. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-10.htm">Isaiah 36:10</a></div><div class="verse">And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Jehovah said unto me</span>, <span class="accented">Go up</span>, etc. (camp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>, where Necho tells Josiah that "God commanded" his expedition against Carchemish). The heathen monarchs frequently represented themselves as directed to make war on a nation by God, or by some particular god. Piankhi Mer-amman says, "I am born of the loins. created from the egg, of the Deity...  I have not acted without his knowing; he ordained that I should act" ('Records of  the Past,' vol. 2. p. 91). Mesha, King of Moab, declares, "Chemosh said to me, Go and take Nebo [in war] against Israel" (ibid., vol. 11. p. 166). Asshur is generally represented as commanding the expeditions of the Assyrian kings (ibid., vol. 1. pp. 21, 48, 60, etc.). Still, it is surprising that Sennacherib should mention "Jehovah" as the God from whom he had received the order to attack Hezekiah, and we may suspect that the term which he actually employed was <span class="accented">Ilu</span>, "God," and that either Rahshakeh, or the reporter of the speech, substituted "Jehovah" as more intelligible to the Jews. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-11.htm">Isaiah 36:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <i>it</i>: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that <i>are</i> on the wall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak...  unto thy servants in the Syrian language</span>; literally, in <span class="accented">the Aramaic language.</span> Aramaeans were widely spread over the entire region between the Lower Tigris and the Mediterranean; and their language seems to have been in general use, as a language of commerce. "Private contract tablets in Aramaic and <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> have been found in the remains of ancient Nineveh" (Cheyne). Rabshakeh had, perhaps, spoken "in the Jews' language " without any ill intent, thinking that it was the only tongue which Jewish envoys would understand; but his so doing was calculated to affect the minds of the common people, and to shake their allegiance to Hezekiah. The envoys, therefore, requested him to employ a foreign tongue, and suggested Aramaic as one which was familiar to them, and which they supposed that he would understand. His employment of Hebrew had shown them that he was a linguist. <span class="cmt_word">In the Jews' language</span>. There was no language peculiar to the Jews as Jews, that is to say, different from the ordinary speech of the Israelites. Both alike spoke Hebrew. In the Old Testament, however, this corn-men language is never called "Hebrew," but either "the tongue of Canaan" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>) or "the Jewish language" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-18.htm">2 Chronicles 32:18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-24.htm">Nehemiah 13:24</a>). Similarly, our own tongue is called "English," though spoken also in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, America, and Australia. <span class="cmt_word">In the ears of the people that are on the wall</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the soldiers placed on the wall to defend it.

But the pride and arrogance of the Assyrians rendered them as careless of diplomatic etiquette as, at a later date, were the Romans (see Polybius, 29:11, &sect; 6; Liv., 45:12). <span class="cmt_word">That they may eat</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">to eat.</span> That is, with no other result than that of being reduced, together with you, to the last extremity of famine, when the siege comes.

He continued his speech in Hebrew, and at the same time purposely raised his voice to a loud pitch. The envoys would have been justified in ordering the archers to shoot him from the wall. But they seem to have been struck of a heap, as Epiphanes was by the audacity of Popillius (see the comment on the preceding verse). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-14.htm">Isaiah 36:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the king</span>. It is scarcely probable that Sennacherib had expressly empowered Rabshakeh to make a speech to the Jewish people, much less that he had dictated its words. But the envoy regards himself as having plenary powers to declare the king's mind. Let not Hezekiah deceive you. By vain hopes of resisting the Assyrian arms successfully (comp. vers. 5-7).

There is nothing improbable in Rabshakeh's having thus spoken. Isaiah had long been encouraging Hezekiah to resist Sennacherib by promises of Divine aid (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-9</a>). Hezekiah would naturally repeat these premises to the people, and could not give their effect in simpler words than by saying, "Jehovah will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria." Spies and deserters would naturally tell the Assyrian envoys what he had said.

It was so much thee usual policy of Assyria to remove to a new locality a conquered people, which had given them trouble, that Rabshakeh felt safe in assuming that the fate in store for the Jews, if they submitted themselves, was a transplantation. Sargon had transported the Israelites to Gozan and Media (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>), the Tibarcni to Assyria, the Commageni to Susiana ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 423). Sennacherib himself had transported into Assyria more than two hundred thousand Aramaeans (ibid., p. 430). It might be confidently predicted that, if he conquered them, he would transplant the Jews. Rabshakeh tries to soften down the hardship of the lot before them by promises of a removal to a land equal in all respects to Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">To a land like your own land</span>. This was certainly not a general principle of Assyrian administration. Nations were removed from the far north to the extreme south, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, from arid to marshy tracts, from fertile regions to comparative deserts. The security of the empire, not the gratification of the transported slaves, was the ruling and guiding principle of all such changes. A land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. The writer of Kings adds, "a land of oil olive and of honey." (On the productiveness of Palestine, see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-7.htm">Numbers 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-23.htm">Deuteronomy 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11, 12</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Beware</i> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">seduce you</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). Sennacherib claims to be entitled to the people's allegiance, and represents Hezekiah as a rebel, who seeks to draw them away from their duty. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land? The successes of the Assyrians, and the religious character of their wars, justified this boast. The pervading idea of the inscriptions is that wars arc undertaken for the glory of the Assyrian deities, particularly of Asshur, for the chastisement of his enemies, and with the object of establishing in each country, as it is brought under subjection, the laws and worship of Asshur (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 322-324 and 531). The nations fight under the protection of their own gods, and thus each war is a struggle between the Assyrian deities and those of the nation with which they arc contending. Hitherto, undoubtedly, Assyria had met with almost uniform success (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a></div><div class="verse">Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where are the gods of Hamath?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>). Sargon had reduced Hamath in his third year,  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>. He had "swept the whole land of Hamath to its extreme limit," taken the king prisoner, and carried him away captive to Assyria, where he flayed and burned him; removed most of the inhabitants, and replaced them by Assyrians; plundered the city of its chief treasures, and placed an Assyrian governor over it (see 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Among the treasures taken were, no doubt, the images of the Hamathite gods, which were uniformly carried off by the Assyrians from a conquered city. <span class="cmt_word">And Arphad</span>. Arphad, or Arpad (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>), had joined with Hamath in the war against Assyria, and was taken by Sargon in the same year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Of Sepharvaim. Scpharvaim, or Sippara, was besieged and captured by Sargon in his twelfth year,  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>. A severe example was made of the inhabitants (G. Smith, 'History of Babylonia,' p. 122). A discovery made by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, in 1881, is thought to prove that Sippara was situated at Abu-Habbah, between Baghdad and the site of Babylon, about sixteen miles from the former city (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 8. pp. 164, 173). "Hena" and "Ivah," joined with Sepharvaim by the author of Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>), seem to be omitted by Isaiah as unimportant. They are thought to have been towns upon the Euphrates, not very distant from Babylon, and have been identified respectively with Anah and Hit. But the identification is in both cases uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Have they delivered Samaria?</span> Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "<span class="accented">How</span> <span class="accented">much less</span> have they delivered Samaria?" Kay, "<span class="accented">Verily have they</span> delivered," regarding the sentence as ironical. Sennacherib can see no distinction between the cities where Jehovah was worshipped, and those which acknowledged any other tutelary god. As Samaria fell, why should not Jerusalem fall?

Rabshakeh's attempt to shake their fidelity had, at any rate, no manifest effect. <span class="cmt_word">For the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not</span>. Hezekiah can scarcely have anticipated that Rabshakeh would so far depart from ordinary usage as to make a speech to "the men on the wall." But he may have been in the immediate neighbourhood, and, when apprised of the envoy's proceedings, may have sent the order. We are not to suppose that the Jewish king was at a loss for an answer. He did not choose to bandy words with an envoy who had behaved himself so outrageously.
