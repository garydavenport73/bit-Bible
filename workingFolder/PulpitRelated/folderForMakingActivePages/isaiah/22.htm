What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - A PROPHECY AGAINST JERUSALEM. The prophet, present in Jerusalem, either actually, or at any rate in spirit, <span class="accented">sees</span> the inhabitants crowded together upon the housetops, in a state of boisterous merriment (vers. 1, 2). Outside the walls is a foreign army threatening the town (vers. 5-7). Preparations have been made for resistance, which are described (vers. 8-11); but there has been no turning to God. On the contrary, the danger has but made the bulk of the people reckless. Instead of humbling themselves and putting on sackcloth, and weeping, and appealing to God's mercy, they have determined to drown care in drink and sensual enjoyment (vers. 12, 13). Therefore the prophet is bidden to denounce woe upon them, and threaten that Jehovah will not forgive their recklessness until their death (ver. 14). There is nothing to mark very distinctly the nationality of the foreign army; but it is certainly represented as made up of contingents from many nations. Delitzsch holds that the Assyrian armies were never so made up, or, at any rate, that the nations here mentioned never served in its ranks ('Site of Paradise,' p. 237); but this is, perhaps, assuming that our knowledge on the subject is more complete and exact than is really the case. It is almost impossible to imagine any other army than the Assyrian besieging Jerusalem in Isaiah's time. Moreover, the particulars concerning the preparations made against the enemy (vers. 9-11) agree with those mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3-5</a> and 30 as made by Hezekiah against Sennacherib. And the second section of the chapter has certainly reference to this period. It seems, therefore, reasonable to regard the siege intended as that conducted by Sennacherib in his fourth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), of which we have a brief account in his annals (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, 11. 15-18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The burden of the valley of vision</span>. "The valley of vision" is only mentioned here and in ver. 5. It must have been one of the deep depressions near Jerusalem troll which there is a good view of the town. The LXX. render, "the burden of the valley of <span class="accented">Zion</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>What aileth thee now</span>? Jerusalem is addressed by the prophet, who assumes the <span class="accented">role</span> of a spectator, surprised at what he <span class="accented">sees</span>, and <span class="accented">asks</span> an explanation. <span class="cmt_word">That thou art wholly gone up to the housetops</span>. Partly, no doubt, they went to watch the enemy and his movements, as Rosenm&uuml;ller says; but still more for feasting and revelry (<a href="../../par/judges/16-27.htm">Judges 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>). The flat roofs of Oriental houses are often used as places of recreation and entertainment, especially in  the evening (Shaw, 'Travels,' p. 211; Chardin, 'Voyages en Perse,' vol. 4. p. 116; Layard, 'Nineveh,' vol. 1. p. 177, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain <i>men are</i> not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A joyous city</span> (comp. ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Thy slain men are not slain with the sword.</span> It is a blockade rather than a siege. Men die, not of wounds, but of privations (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>). Sennacherib himself says, "Hezekiah, like a caged bird, within Jerusalem, his royal city, I confined; towers round about him I raised; and the exit of the great gate of his city I shut" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 15-18). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a></div><div class="verse">All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, <i>which</i> have fled from far.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All thy rulers are fled together</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all thy chief men</span>. We must make allowance for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is that numbers of the principal men, regarding resistance as vain, had endeavored to make their escape from the doomed town, but had been captured and bound by the enemies' archers. <span class="cmt_word">All that are found in thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">belonging to thee</span>. The reference is to those who had made their escape and were fleeing far away. The archers seize them, and bind them <span class="accented">all together</span>. We often see a number of captives bound together by a single rope in the Egyptian bas-reliefs. <span class="cmt_word">Which have fled from far</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which were flying far away</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore said I.</span> The prophet turns from the description of the scene before him to an account of his own feelings. <span class="cmt_word">Look away from me, he says</span>; "leave me free to vent my sorrow without restraint; I wish for no consolation - only leave me to myself." <span class="cmt_word">Because of the spoiling</span>. The word used sometimes means" destruction;" but" spoiling" is a better rendering here. Sennacherib describes his "spoiling" of Jerusalem on this occasion as follows: "Thirty talents of gold, eight hundred talents of silver, precious carbuncles, great... stones, couches of ivory, lofty thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, weapons, everything, a great treasure, and his daughters, the eunuchs of his palace, male musicians, and female musicians, to Nineveh, the city of my dominion, did Hezekiah send after me" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 29-37). To what straits Hezekiah was reduced in order to collect a sufficient amount of the precious metals we learn from <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15, 16</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a></div><div class="verse">For <i>it is</i> a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is a day... By the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">there is a day to the Lord</span>; or, <span class="accented">the Lord has a day</span>. God has in reserve such a day; and it will assuredly arrive in due course. Hence the prophet's grief. <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of vision</span>. We may suppose that Hezekiah, before he made the submission recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a> and in the 'Cylinder of Sennacherib,' col. 4:11. 28, 29, tried the chances of battle against the Assyrians <span class="accented">in this valley</span>, and that Isaiah had a prophetic vision of the fight. <span class="cmt_word">Breaking down the walls</span>; rather, <span class="accented">undermining</span>. The Assyrian sculptures show numerous examples of this practice. Sometimes swords or spears are used to dislodge the stones of the wall, sometimes crow-bars or axes (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 82). <span class="cmt_word">Crying</span>. Some regard this word, and also that translated "the walls" in the preceding clause, as proper names, and render the passage, "Kir undermineth, and Shoa is at the mount" (Ewald, Cheyne, Luzzatto). But it seems unlikely that "Kit" would be mentioned twice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men <i>and</i> horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elam bare the quiver</span>. Elam, the country extending from the Zagros range to the Lower Tigris, and watered by the Choaspes, Eulaeus, Pasitigris, and other rivers, was an independent kingdom from a very early date (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1, 9</a>), and in Isaiah's time was generally hostile to Assyria. Sargon, however, relates that he conquered a portion of the country, planted colonies in it from the more western parts of his empire, and placed both colonists and natives under the governor of Babylon ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 16). It is thus quite possible that both Sargon and Sennacherib may have had a contingent of Elamites in their armies. <span class="cmt_word">With chariots of men and horsemen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with troops of men</span> (<span class="accented">who were</span>) <span class="accented">horsemen</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>). Kir uncovered the shield. "Kir" is mentioned in 2 Kings as the place to which Tiglath-Pileser transported the inhabitants of Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>), and by Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>) as the original country from which the Syrians were derived. It has been recently identified with Kirkhi, near Diarbekr, or with Kirruri, in the Urumiyah country (Cheyne); but neither identification is marc than possible. (On uncovering shields as a preliminary to engaging in battle, see Caesar, 'Do Bell. Gall.,' 2:21.)

God drew this aside, and they suddenly saw their danger, and began to think how they could best defend themselves. Arms were the first things needed. <span class="cmt_word">The armor of the house of the forest</span>. "The house of the forest" was probably that portion of the palace of Solomon which he had called "the house of the forest of Lebanon"  (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>). This was, it would seem, used as an armor (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/39-2.htm">Isaiah 39:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9</a></div><div class="verse">Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have seen also.... are many</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye saw also were many</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The breaches of the city of David</span>. "The city of David" may be here a name for Jerusalem generally, as "the city where David dwelt" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>), or it may designate the eastern hill, where David fixed his residence (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15, 16, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> we read that Hezekiah at this time "built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Mille in <span class="accented">the city of David</span>," where a particular part of Jerusalem seems certainly to be meant. <span class="cmt_word">Ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</span> The arrangements made by Hezekiah with respect to the water-supply at the time of Sennacherib's invasion, seem to have been the following: He found on the north of the city, where the Assyrian attack was certain to be delivered, in the vicinity of the Damascus gate, a pool or reservoir (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>), fed by a conduit from some natural source, which lay open and patent to view. The superfluous water ran off from it by a "brook" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-4.htm">2 Chronicles 32:4</a>), which passed down the Tyropoeon valley, and joined the Kedron to the southeast of Ophel. His first step was to cover over and conceal the open reservoir, and also the" brook" which ran from it, at least as far as the northern city wall, to prevent their use by the Assyrians. He then further made a conduit underground (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>) within the city, along the Tyropoeon depression, to a second reservoir, or "pool," also within the city, which could be freely used by the inhabitants (see ver. 11; and comp. Ecclus. 48:17). Further, it is probable that he carried a conduit from this second pool, under the temple area, to the" fount of the Virgin" on the eastern side of Ophel, and thence further conveyed the water by a tunnel through Ophel to the "pool of Siloam." (This last may be the work here alluded to.) The inscription recently discovered at this peel is probably of Hezekiah's time (see 'Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for April, 1881, p. 70). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-10.htm">Isaiah 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have numbered... have broken down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye numbered</span>... <span class="accented">ye broke down</span>. The "numbering" was probably in order to see how many could be spared for pulling down. The repair of the walls with materials thus furnished was a sign of extreme haste and urgency. It would seem from vers. 7, 8 that the repairs were not begun until the town was invested. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a></div><div class="verse">Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye made also a ditch</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">lake</span>, or <span class="accented">reservoir</span> (see the comment on ver. 9).

It has been said that "baldness" was forbidden by the Law (Cheyne); but this is not so, absolutely. Baldness was wholly forbidden to the priests (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a>); and certain peculiar modes of shaving the hair, the beard, and the eyebrows, practiced by idolatrous nations, were prohibited to all the people (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>). But such shaving of the head as was practiced by Job (<a href="../../par/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>) and other pious men, was not forbidden to laymen, any more than the wearing of sackcloth. It was regarded as a natural mode of exhibiting grief.

"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," is a common sentiment, if not a common expression. It has been supposed to have given rise to the Egyptian practice of carrying round the model of a mummy to the guests at feasts. According to the Greeks, Sardanapalus had a phrase very like it engraved upon his tomb ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 500). Sailors have often acted upon it, when they found it impossible to save their ship. On seeing their city invested, a portion of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, despairing of safety, did as sailors have done so frequently.

It has, therefore, been generally felt that there must be a secondary application of the passage. According to some, the two officials represent respectively the two cove-hunts, the old and the new; according to others, they stand for the two great parties in the Jewish slate of the time - that which put its trust in Jehovah, and that which leant upon heathen alliances. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of hosts</span>.

We must not suppose, however, that the Jews, like the Egyptians and Etruscans, regarded the soul as inhabiting the tomb. The soul descended into <span class="accented">sheol</span>; the grave was the "<span class="accented">habitation"</span> of the body only.

Jehovah scorns to be meant in both clauses (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>). The full accomplishment of this prophecy is nowhere declared to us. We merely find that, by the time of Rabshakeh's arrival at Jerusalem as Sennacherib's envoy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2-4</a>), Shebna had lost his post as prefect of the palace, and filled the lower position of scribe or secretary. He may, however, have been subsequently further degraded, and thereupon he may have fled to Egypt, as Jeroboam did (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. In the day of Shebna's deposition from his office of prefect of the palace. <span class="cmt_word">My servant Eliakim</span>. On the dignity of this title, when given by God himself, see the comment on Isaiah 20:3. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21</a></div><div class="verse">And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With thy robe... with thy girdle</span>. The dress of office worn by Shebna would be taken from him, and Eliakim would be invested therewith. The "robe" is the long-sleeved cloak or tunic worn commonly by persons of rank; the "girdle" is probably an ornamental one, like those of the priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>), worn over the inner tunic. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be a father</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a protector, counselor, guide (comp. <a href="../../par/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16</a>, "I was <span class="accented">a father to the poor</span>: and the cause which I knew not I searched out"). It is, perhaps, implied that Shebna had not conducted himself as a "father." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-22.htm">Isaiah 22:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder</span>. A key would seem to have been the special badge of the prefect's office, which included the control of the stores (ver. 15), and the general management of the household. It was, perhaps, a part of the form of investiture, that the key should be first laid on the prefect's shoulder and then delivered into his hand. Among the Greeks the priests of Ceres are said to have borne a key on their shoulder, permanently, as a badge of office (Callimach., 'Hymn. ad Cererem,' 1. 45). The reference to this passage in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a> is sufficient to show that Eliakim, the "servant of Jehovah" (ver. 20), is, to a certain extent, a type of Christ; perhaps also of his faithful ministers (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-23.htm">Isaiah 22:23</a></div><div class="verse">And I will fasten him <i>as</i> a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>). The idea intended to be expressed is firmness and fixity of tenure. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house</span> (compare the next verse). All his relations, even the most remote, shall derive honor from him, and bask in the sunshine of his prosperity. So shall all members of the family of God, made sons of God by adoption in Christ, participate in the final glory of Christ in his eternal kingdom.

According to scriptural notions, the "glory" of a family consists very much in its size (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>, etc.).

The word translated "issue" is a term of contempt (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the vessels of cups</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of bowls</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To all the vessels of flagons</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of pitchers</span>. "A numerous, undistinguished, family connection" seems to be intended (Delitzsch). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-25.htm">Isaiah 22:25</a></div><div class="verse">In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that <i>was</i> upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - SEQUEL OF THE PROPHECY CONCERNING ELIAKIM. This verse has been truly called "an enigma" (Kay). It is impossible to understand it of Shebna. "The nail that was fastened in a sure place" can only refer to the nail said to have been so fastened in ver. 23. Are we, then, to understand that Eliakim too will experience a reverse of fortune? But then all the force of the contrast between him and Shebna would be gone. Is it not possible that the prophet, seeing in Eliakim a type of the Messiah, and becoming more and more Messianic in his utterances, has ended by forgetting the type altogether, and being absorbed in the thought of the antitype? He, the nail, so surely fixed in his eternal place, would nevertheless be "removed" for a time, and then "he cut down and fall" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>). At the same time would be "cut off" the burden which Messiah bore (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, "He bare the sin of many"). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. Not the day of Shebna's fall, certainly (ver. 20), but some ether. Is not the day that of Christ's earthly mission, when it seemed as if his people were about to acknowledge him (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-40</a>), and his throne to be established, but suddenly Messiah was "cut off" (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>) - stricken for the transgression of his people (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">The burden that was upon it shall be cut off.</span> The great burden upon the Messiah was the load of human sin which he had to bear. "He himself bare our sins in his own body on the tree" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). By his death this burden was "cut off" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath spoken it.</span> The double attestation, at the beginning and at the end of the verse, is a mark of the vast importance of the announcement contained in it, which <span class="accented">is</span>, in fact, the germ of the great doctrine of the atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 21"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/23.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 23"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 23" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
