And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days</span>. The illness of Hezekiah is fixed by ver. 5 (and <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a>) to the fourteenth year of his reign, or  <span class="date">B.C. 714</span>. The entire narrative of this chapter and the next is therefore thirteen or fourteen years earlier than that of ch. 36, 37, which belongs to Hezekiah's closing years,  <span class="date">B.C. 701-698</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 26:l, 2). <span class="cmt_word">Sick unto death</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> attacked by a malady which, if it had run its natural course, would have been fatal. <span class="cmt_word">Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz</span>. This double designation of Isaiah, by his office and by his descent, marks the original independence of this narrative, which was not intended for a continuation of ch. 37. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt die, and not live</span>. Prophecies were often threats, and, when such, were conditional, announcing results which would follow unless averted by prayer or repentance (compare Jonah's prophecy, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown," <a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-2.htm">Isaiah 38:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall</span>. The action resembles that of Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>); but the spirit is wholly different. Ahab turned away in sullenness, Hezekiah that he might pray undisturbed Beds seem to have been placed in the corners of rooms, with the head against one wall of the room, and one side against another. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a></div><div class="verse">And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done <i>that which is</i> good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember now, O Lord</span>. Hezekiah was in the full vigour of life - thirty-nine years old only. He had probably as yet no son, since Manasseh, who succeeded him, was but twelve (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-1.htm">2 Chronicles 33:1</a>) when Hezekiah died at the age of fifty-four. It was a grievous thing to a Jew to leave no male offspring: it was viewed as a mark of the Divine displeasure to be cut off in the midst of one's days (<a href="../../par/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15, 16</a>: <a href="../../par/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>). Hezekiah asked himself - Had he deserved such a sentence? He thought that he had not. He knew that, with whatever shortcomings, he had endeavoured to serve God, had trusted in him (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>), cleaved to him (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>), "departed not from following him, but kept his commandments" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>) He therefore ventured upon an expostulation and an earnest prayer; and God was pleased to hear the prayer and to grant it. <span class="cmt_word">I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart</span>. Compare the unbiased testimony of the authors of Kings and Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-2.htm">2 Chronicles 29:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-20.htm">2 Chronicles 31:20, 21</a>). Under the old dispensation, there was nothing to prevent men from pleading their righteousness before God (comp. <a href="../../par/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4-40</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>-2; 18:20-24; 26:1-8, etc.). Hezekiah, however, does not really regard himself as sinless (comp. ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah wept sore</span>. In the East feelings are but little restrained. Joy shows itself in laughter and shouting, grief in tears and shrill cries. Xerxes wept when he thought of the shortness of human life (Herod., 7:46); the Persians rent the air with load cries at the funeral of Masistius (ibid., 9:24); on the news of the defeat at Salamis all Susa "cried aloud, and wept  and wailed without stint" (ibid., 8:99). So David wept for Jonathan (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>) and again for Absalom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-1.htm">2 Samuel 19:1</a>); Joash wept when he heard the words of the Law (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a>); Nehemiah wept at the desolation of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>); the ambassadors of Hezekiah, when disappointed of the object of their embassy, "wept bitterly" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). No king in the East puts himself under any restraint, if he has an inclination for either tears or laughter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying</span>. The author of Kings describes graphically how Isaiah, after delivering his message, had gone out, but had not reached the middle court of the palace, when his footsteps were arrested, and the Divine voice bade him "turn again and relieve Hezekiah's fears by a fresh announcement" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>). So swiftly does God answer "the prayer of faith." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a></div><div class="verse">Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord,...   I have heard thy prayer</span>. According to the author of Kings, the full message sent to Hezekiah was, "I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: <span class="accented">behold</span>, <span class="accented">I will heal thee</span>: <span class="accented">on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord.</span> And I will add unto thy clays fifteen years; and I will deliver time and this city out of the hand of the King of Assyria; and I will defend this city for <span class="accented">mine own sake</span>, <span class="accented">and for my servant David's sake"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-5.htm">2 Kings 20:5, 6</a>). The words in italics are additional to those here reported by Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">Fifteen years</span>. This was doubling, or rather more than doubling, the length of Hezekiah's reign, and allowing him a length of life exceeding that of the great majority of the kings of Judah, who seldom attained the age of fifty. Hezekiah lived to be fifty-four. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-6.htm">Isaiah 38:6</a></div><div class="verse">And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7</a></div><div class="verse">And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord</span>. It was the day of the free offering of "signs" by God to those whom his providence had placed at the head of his people. Ahaz had been offered a sign (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11</a>), but had refused the offer made him (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-12.htm">Isaiah 7:12</a>); the Lord had then "himself" given him a sign." Hezekiah received a sign to assure him of the complete discomfiture of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>); an offer was here made him of a sign of a peculiar kind, and it was offered under peculiar conditions. We learn from 2 Kings that a choice was submitted to him  - he was to determine whether time, as measured by a certain timepiece or clock, which was known as "the dial of Ahaz," should make a sudden leap forward - the shadow advancing ten degrees upon the dial (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9</a>), or whether it should retire backwards, the shadow upon the same dial receding ten degrees. Hezekiah determined in favour of the latter <span class="accented">sign</span>, from its appearing to him the more difficult of accomplishment; and on his declaring his decision, the shadow receded to the prescribed distance. Time was rolled backward, or at any rate appeared to be rolled backward; and the king, seeing so great a miracle, accepted without hesitation the further predictions that had been made to him. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken</span>. By the <span class="accented">nexus</span> of this verse with the preceding, it would naturally be concluded that "the thing" to be done was the defence of Jerusalem; but ver. 22, which belongs properly to this part of the narrative, shows the contrary. Hezekiah had asked for a sign" that he should go up to the house of the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun-dial of Ahaz</span>. We are informed by Herodotus that the sun-dial was an invention of the Babylonians (Herod., 2:109), from whom it would readily pass to the Assyrians. Ahaz may have obtained a knowledge of it, or an actual specimen, when he visited Tiglath-Pileser at Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a>), and, on his return to his capital, have caused one to be erected there. Sun-dials are of several kinds. The one here spoken of seems to have consisted of a set of steps, with a perpendicular gnomon or pole at the top, the shadow of which receded up the steps as the sun rose in the heavens, and descended down them as the sun declined. We must suppose that the sign was given in the forenoon, when the shadow was gradually creeping up the steps. Hezekiah thought that a sudden jump in the same direction would be as nothing compared with a reversal of the motion, and therefore required that the shadow should go back, which it did. How the effect was produced, whether by an eclipse as argued by Mr. Bosanquet ('Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 3. pp. 34-40), or by refraction, or by an actual alteration of the earth's motion, we are not told; but there is reason to believe that the cause, whatever it was, was local, not general, since the King of Babylon subsequently sent ambassadors, to inquire concerning "<span class="accented">the wonder</span> <span class="accented">that was done in the land"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sun returned ten degrees</span>. We must not press this expression as indicating a real alteration of the <span class="accented">sun's</span> place in the heavens. The meaning is that <span class="accented">the shadow cast by the sun re</span>turned.

It has been well termed, "a peculiarly sweet and plaintive specimen of Hebrew psalmody" (Cheyne). Four stanzas or strophes of unequal length are thought to be discernible: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the beginning of ver. 10 to the end of ver. 12;  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the beginning of ver. 13 to the end of ver. 14; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> from the beginning of ver. 15 to the end of ver. 17; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> from the beginning of ver. 18 to the end of ver. 20. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the first two the monarch is looking forward to death, and his strain is mournful; in the last two he has received the promise of recovery, and pours out his thankfulness.

Hezekiah calls on God to be the Surety; but God is the Creditor! Still, there is an appeal from God's justice to God's mercy - from Jehovah who punishes to Jehovah who forgives sin; and this appeal Hezekiah seems to intend to make when he beseeches God to "undertake for him."

Hezekiah, though lately he protested his integrity (ver. 3). did not mean to say that he was sinless, lie knew that he had sinned; he regarded his sins as having brought down upon him the sentence of death; as God has revoked the sentence, he knows that he has pardoned his sins and put them away from his remembrance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a></div><div class="verse">For the grave cannot praise thee, death can <i>not</i> celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The grave cannot praise thee</span> (cormpare the comment on ver. 11). It is avoiding the plain force of these passages to say that Hezekiah <span class="accented">only means</span> that those who go to Hades in a state of condemnation cannot be expected there to praise God (Kay). He speaks broadly and generally of all: "The living, the living, shall praise thee; <span class="accented">Sheol</span> cannot praise thee; Death cannot celebrate thee." Manifestly, though he believes in a future state, it is one in which there is either no energy at all, or at any rate no devotional energy. He may think, with Isaiah. that "the righteous man," when he is "taken away," will "enter into peace" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1, 2</a>); but absolute "peace" precludes energy (see Arist., 'Eth. Nit.,' 1. 10. &sect; 2). Hezekiah shrinks from losing all his activities, including his sense of personal communion with God. He does not, perhaps, "look on the condition of the faithful departed as one of <span class="accented">comfortless gloom</span>;" but he views it as one of deprivation, and is unwilling to enter into it. It was by the coming of Christ and the preaching of his gospel that "life and immortality" were first truly "brought to light" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>).

The repetition is emphatic, and has the force of "the living, and the living <span class="accented">only."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The father to the children</span>. Hezekiah may, or may not, have had children himself at the time. Manasseh was not born; but he may have had daughters, or even other sons, who did not survive him. He is not, however, perhaps, thinking of his own ease. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD <i>was ready</i> to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> was ready to save me; rather, <span class="accented">came to my rescue</span>; <span class="accented">came and saved</span> me. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments</span>; rather, <span class="accented">therefore will we play my stringed instruments.</span> Hezekiah calls the stringed instruments his, because he had recalled their use, and re-established them as a part of the temple service after the suspension of that service by Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>). His intention now is to take continual part with the Levites in (he choral praises of God, which were a part of the daily worship of the temple. This is to him the natural mode of expressing his thankfulness to God for the mercy vouchsafed him.

This remedy is said to be one still employed in the East for the cure of ordinary boils; but it must have been quite insufficient for the cure of such a dangerous tumour, or carbuncle, as that from which Hezekiah was suffering. In miraculous cures, both the Old Testament prophets and our Lord himself frequently employed a means, insufficient in itself, but supernaturally rendered sufficient, to effect the intended purpose (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-35.htm">2 Kings 4:35, 41, 5</a>:14; <a href="../../par/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Upon the boil</span>. The term here translated "boil" is used in Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9-11</a>) for the affliction which constituted the sixth plague, in Leviticus (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-18.htm">Leviticus 13:18-23</a>) for an ulcer accompanying one of the worst forms of leprosy, in Deuteronomy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 35</a>) for "the botch of Egypt," and in Job (<a href="../../par/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>) for the last of the visitations from which he suffered. It is not unlikely that it was of a leprous character.
