The groves and "gardens" of Daphne, near Antioch. became famous in later times as the scene of idolatrous practices intimately bound up with the grossest and most shameless sensualism. We have few details of the ancient Syrian rites; but there is reason to believe that, wherever Astarte, the Dea Syra, was worshipped, whether at Daphne, or at Hierapolis, or at Balbek, or at Aphek, or at Damascus, or in Palestine, one and the same character of cult prevailed. The nature-goddess was viewed as best worshipped by rites into which sensualism entered as an essential element. Profligacy that cannot be described polluted the consecrated precincts, which were rendered attractive by all that was beautiful and delightful, whether in art or nature-by groves, gardens, statues, fountains, shrines, temples, music, processions, shows - and which were in consequence frequented both day and night by a multitude of votaries. <span class="cmt_word">And burneth incense upon altars of brick</span>; literally, upon the bricks. It is not clear that "altars" are intended. More probably the incense was burnt upon the tiled or bricked roofs of houses, where the Jews of Jeremiah's time "burned incense unto all the host of heaven" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-29.htm">Jeremiah 32:29</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). Brick altars are nowhere mentioned. The Assyrians and Babylonians made their altars of either stone or metal ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 36, 37; Herod., 1. 183). The Hebrews in early times had altars of earth (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The "altar of incense" in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-3</a>) was of wood plated with gold; that of burnt offering, of wood plated with bronze (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1, 2</a>). Solomon's altars were similar. Elijah on one occasion made an altar of twelve rough stones (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>). The Assyrians used polished stone, as did the Greeks and Romans.

Not in mere defiance of the Law, but in sacrificial meals (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>) of which swine's flesh formed a part. Swine were sacrificial animals in Egypt (Herod., 2:47, 48), in Phoenicia (Lucian, 'De Dea Syra,' &sect; 54), and with the Greeks and Romans. They do not appear to have been employed for the purpose either by the Assyrians or the Babylonians. It was probably in Palestine that the Jews had eaten "swine's flesh," at sacrifices to Baal or Astarte (Ashtoreth). In later times to do so was regarded as one of the worst abominations (1 Macc. 1:41-64; 2 Macc, 6. and 7.). <span class="cmt_word">Broth of abominable things</span>. Either broth made from swine's flesh, or from the flesh of other unclean animals, as the hare and rabbit (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-5.htm">Leviticus 11:5, 6</a>), or perhaps simply broth made from the flesh of any animals that had been offered to idols (<a href="../../par/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>).

In Isaiah, and especially in the "Book of Consolation" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.), promises are almost always intermingled with threatenings. The threats extend to the bulk of the nation; the promises are limited to "a remnant," since a remnant only could be brought to "seek" and serve God (ver. 10). Here the announcement that a remnant would be spared is introduced by a simile from men's treatment of their own vineyards (ver. 8). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the new wine is found in the cluster</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">when new wine is found in a grape-bunch</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as when even a single cluster of grapes is spied on a vine-stem, the vine-pruners say one to another, "Destroy not that stem, but spare it," so will God refrain from destroying those stocks in his vineyard, which give even a small promise of bearing good fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Destroy it not</span>. The words are thought to be those of a well-known vintage-song, which is perhaps alluded to in the heading (<span class="accented">Al-taschith</span>) prefixed to <a href="../../par/psalms/57.htm">Psalm 57, 58</a>, and 59.

The plateau of Mature reaches a height of 3600 feet. The only Palestinian plains are those of Esdraelon, Sharon, and the Ghor, or Jordan valley. Thus the land may well be spoken of as "my mountains." <span class="cmt_word">Mine elect</span> (comp. ch. 43:20; 45:4).

The word may be suspected to be cognate to the Arabic "Manat," a god recognized in the Koran as a mediator with Allah; but can scarcely have any connection with the Aryan names for the moon deity, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">Mena</span>, and the like.

The religious exiles would return to the land of promise as soon as permitted, and would there prosper in a worldly sense - have abundance to eat and drink, rejoice, and sing for joy (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11-13</a>). The irreligious, remaining in Babylonia, would suffer hunger and thirst, endure shame, cry and howl for sorrow and vexation of spirit. This would be one fulfilment of the prophecy; but there would also be another. God's servants at all times and in all places would be sustained with spiritual food, and "rejoice and sing for joy of heart." His adversaries would everywhere feel a craving for the "meat" and "drink," which alone satisfy the soul, and would be oppressed with care, and with a sense of shame, and suffer anguish of spirit.

In their formulas of imprecation the Jews were in the habit of saying, "The Lord make thee like" this or that person, or this or that class of persons. The name of the exiles should be used in this manner. Unto my chosen (see the comment on ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God shall slay</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee</span> (see the comment on ver. 12). Some, however, take the words as part of the formula of imprecation. <span class="cmt_word">And call his servants by another name</span> (compare what is said of "new name" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a></div><div class="verse">That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he who blesseth himself</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so that he who blesses himself.</span> The sequence of the argument is not altogether clear. Perhaps it is recant that God will call them <span class="accented">by his own Name</span> (<a href="../../par/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>) - "the people of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>); and thence it will become natural for them to use no other name, either when they call for a blessing on themselves, or have to confirm a covenant with others. <span class="cmt_word">In the God of truth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the God of the Amen</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God who keeps covenant and promise, to which the strongest formula of consent was the word "Amen" (see <a href="../../par/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>, etc.). Similarly, St. John calls our Lord "the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because the former troubles are forgotten</span>. When the blessed time has come wherein men call themselves by the Name of the Lord, and know of only one God as the Source of blessing and the confirmation of an oath, then the former state of human affairs, with all its "troubles," will have passed away, and the new era will be inaugurated, which the prophet proceeds to describe at length (vers. 17-25). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a></div><div class="verse">For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-25.</span> - A PROMISE OF NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH. The final answer of God to the complaint and prayer of his people (ch. 64.) is now given. The entire existing state of things is to pass away. God will create a new heaven and  a new earth, and place his people therein; and the old conditions will be all changed, and the old grounds of complaint disappear. In the "new Jerusalem" there will be no sorrow, neither "weeping" nor "crying" (ver. 19); life will be greatly prolonged (ver. 20); men will always enjoy the fruit of their labours (vers. 21, 22), and see their children grow up (ver. 23). Prayer will be answered almost before it is uttered (ver. 24). Finally, there will be peace in the animal world, and between the animal world and man. No living thing will kill or hurt another in all God's "holy mountain" (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I create.</span> The same verb is used as in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; and the prophet's idea seems to be that the existing heaven and earth are to be entirely destroyed (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19, 20</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>), and a fresh heaven and earth created in their place out of nothing. The "new Jerusalem" is not the old Jerusalem renovated, but is a veritable "new Jerusalem," "created a rejoicing" (ver. 18; scrap. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). The germ of the teaching will be found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The former shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be remembered.</span> Some suppose "the former troubles" (see ver. 16) to be meant; but it is best (with Delitzsch) to understand "the former heavens and earth." The glory of the new heavens and earth would be such that the former ones would not only not be regretted, but would not even be had in remembrance. No one would so much as think of them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/65-18.htm">Isaiah 65:18</a></div><div class="verse">But be ye glad and rejoice for ever <i>in that</i> which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I create Jerusalem</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, "I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, <span class="accented">coming down from God out of heaven</span>, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband"). The description which follows in vers. 11, 12 is quite unlike that of the old Jerusalem. A rejoicing. The "new Jerusalem" was to be from the first all joy and rejoicing - a scene of perpetual gladness. Her people also was to be "a joy" or "a delight," since God would delight in them (ver. 19). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/65-19.htm">Isaiah 65:19</a></div><div class="verse">And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of weeping shall be no more heard</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). The reasons there given are satisfactory: "There shall be no more death, neither sorrow...  neither shall there be any more pain." But these reasons scarcely apply here. For Isaiah's "new Jerusalem" is not without death (ver. 20), nor without sorrow, since it is not without sin (ver. 20), nor, as there is death there, is it without pain. Isaiah's picture, according to Delitzsch, represents the millennial state, not the final condition of the redeemed; but this trait - the absence of <span class="accented">all</span> weeping - can only be literally true of the final state. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a></div><div class="verse">There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner <i>being</i> an hundred years old shall be accursed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be no more thence an infant</span> <span class="cmt_word">of days;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there shall not go from the new Jerusalem into the unseen world any infant of a few days old. On the contrary, even "the youth" shall reach a hundred; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who dies when he is a hundred shall be regarded as cut off in his youth. The general rule shall be, that old men shall "fill their days," or attain to patriarchal longevity. Even the sinner, who is under the curse of God, shall not be cut off till he is a hundred. What is most remarkable in the description is that death and sin are represented as still continuing. Death was spoken of as "swallowed up in victory" in one of the earlier descriptions of Messiah's kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/65-21.htm">Isaiah 65:21</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall build houses, and inhabit <i>them</i>; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall build houses, and inhabit them</span>.

The cedars of Lebanon, the oaks of Bashan, were known to have an antiquity of centuries. Isaiah may have had a knowledge of other trees to which attached the tradition of a yet longer existence. In our own day Brazil and California have furnished proofs of vegetable growths exceeding a millennium. Mine elect shall long enjoy; literally, <span class="accented">shall wear out</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> have the <span class="accented">full</span> use and enjoyment of the work of their hands.

God is always "more ready to hear than we to pray." In the "new Jerusalem" he will be prompt to answer his people's prayers almost before they are uttered. It is involved in this, as Delitzsch notes, that the will of the people shall be in harmony with the will of Jehovah, and that their prayers will therefore be acceptable prayers.

The portraiture here is far less elaborate than in the earlier chapter, to which the present passage may be regarded as a refer-once.
