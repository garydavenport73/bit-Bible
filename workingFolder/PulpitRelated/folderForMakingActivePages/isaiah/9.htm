The section of the prophecy commencing with <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a> terminates in this glorious burst of glad and gracious promise. The gist of the whole section is: "Israel shall not suffer from Pekah and Rezin; her oppressors shall be Assyria and Egypt, more especially the former; Assyria shall overwhelm her, crush her, lay her low; she shall remain awhile in gloom and darkness; but at length the darkness shall be dispelled; a 'great light' shall shine forth, first in the north, then over all the land; 'the rod of the oppressor' shall be broken; a Child shall be born, who shall bear marvelous names, and shall rule over the full kingdom of David in justice and righteousness forever."

Contempt was brought on the more northern part of the Holy Land, first when it was overrun and ravaged by the Syrians (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>) under Ben-hadad, and more recently when it bore the brunt of the Assyrian attack (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) under Tiglath-Pileser. <span class="cmt_word">At the first... and afterward</span>; rather, <span class="accented">at the former time</span>... <span class="accented">in the latter time</span>. The contrast is between two periods of Israel's history, the existing period and the Messianic. <span class="cmt_word">And afterward did more grievously afflict her</span>. This is altogether wrong. Translate, <span class="accented">So in the latter time he hath brought honor on the way of the sea</span>. The perfect is a "prophetic perfect," and the reference is to the honor that would be done to the northern districts, "the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali," by the Messiah dwelling there (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-14.htm">Matthew 4:14-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The way of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district about the sea of Tiberias, called "the sea of Kinnereth" (equivalent to "Gennesareth") in <a href="../../par/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, and "the sea of Galilee" in <a href="../../par/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tract east of the sea and of the upper Jordan, where the five thousand were fed, and where our Lord was transfigured. <span class="cmt_word">Galilee of the nations</span>. The name "Galilee" seems to have been given to the outlying circuit, or zone, on the north, which was debatable ground between the Israelites and their neighbors (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>). The word means "circuit," or "ring." Though claimed as theirs by the Israelites, it was largely peopled by "Gentiles."

All the world was "in darkness" when Christ came; but here the Jews especially seem to be intended. It was truly a dark time with them when Christ came (see Dollinger's 'Judenthum and Heidenthum,' vol. 2. pp. 301-335). <span class="cmt_word">Have seen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">saw</span>. The "prophetic" preterit is used throughout the whole passage. <span class="cmt_word">A great light.</span> "The Light of the world," "the Sun of righteousness," "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, "first broke on man in that northern tract" by the way of the sea, "when Jesus came forward to teach and to preach in "Galilee of the Gentiles." For thirty years he had dwelt at Nazareth, in Zebulon. There he had first come forward to teach in a synagogue (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>); in Galilee he had done his first miracles (<a href="../../par/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-54.htm">John 4:54</a>); at Capernaum. "Upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim," he commenced his preaching of repentance (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-17</a>). The "light" first streamed forth in this quarter,  glorifying the region on which contempt had long been poured. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast multiplied the nation, <i>and</i> not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, <i>and</i> as <i>men</i> rejoice when they divide the spoil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy</span>. Dr. Kay defends this reading, and supposes a contrast of time between this clause and the next; he renders, "Thou <span class="accented">didst</span> multiply the nation" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the days of Solomon and again in those of Uzziah) "and not increase the joy; <span class="accented">but now</span>," etc. The objection is that the verbs are all in the same tense, the simple preterit, and that there is nothing in the original corresponding to "but now." Almost all other recent commentators accept the solution offered by the Masoretic reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>), which makes the passage simple and easy: "Thou hast multiplied the nation; its joy thou hast increased; they joy before thee," etc. (So many Hebrew manuscripts, the Alexandrine Septuagint, the Syriac, Gesenius, Knobel, Cheyne, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">According to the joy in harvest.</span> "The joy in harvest" was to the Jews the joy of the Feast of Tabernacles, or in gathering (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), held when the last fruits were brought in. But the prophet is perhaps taking a wider view, and thinking of the many harvest festivals prevailing throughout Western Asia, all of them originating in gratitude to the Giver of all good, and many of them comprising manifestations of joy more jubilant than those habitual to his sedater countrymen. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast broken the yoke of his burden</span>, etc. The coming of the Messiah sets the Israelites free, removes the yoke from off their neck, breaks the rod wherewith their shoulders were beaten, delivers them from bondage into the "glorious liberty of the children of God." Not, however, in an earthly sense, since the Messiah's kingdom was not of this world. The "yoke" is that of sin, the "oppressor" is that prince of darkness, who had well-nigh brought all mankind under his dominion when Christ came. <span class="cmt_word">His oppressor</span>; literally, <span class="accented">his task-master -</span> the same word which is used of the Egyptian taskmasters in <a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As in the day of Midian.</span> The "day of Midian" is probably the time of Israel's deliverance from the Midianite oppression by Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-25</a>). The special characteristic of the deliverance was, as Dr. Kay well observes, "that it was accomplished without military prowess by a small body of men selected out of Israel, selected expressly in order that Israel might not vaunt itself against the Lord, saying, My own hand hath saved me (<a href="../../par/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>)."

The noun and participle, which are cognate words, occur only in this passage. <span class="cmt_word">And garments</span>, etc. Translate, <span class="accented">And every garment that is rolled in blood</span>, <span class="accented">shall be for burning</span>, <span class="accented">even fuel for fire</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto us a child is born</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14-16</a>, where the promise of "a child," "a son," is first made - a child who was, like this Child, to be "God with us"). <span class="cmt_word">The government shall be upon his shoulder.</span> The word translated "government" (<span class="accented">misrah</span>) occurs only here and in ver. 7. It is probably to be connected with <span class="accented">sat</span>, "prince," and Israel. Government was regarded as a burden, to be born on the back or shoulders, and was sometimes symbolized by a key laid upon the shoulder (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-22.htm">Isaiah 22:22</a>). Vizier means "burdened." The Latin writers often speak of the civil power as borne on the shoulders of magistrates (Cic., 'Orat. pro Flacc,' &sect; 95; Plin., 'Paneg.,' &sect; 10). As God, our Lord governed all things from the beginning; as man, he set up a "kingdom" which he still governs - upon the earth. <span class="cmt_word">His name shall be called.</span> It is perhaps not very important whether we view what follows as one name or several. Isaiah does not really mean that the "Child" should bear <span class="accented">as</span> a name, or names, any of the expressions, but only that they should be truly applicable to him. <span class="cmt_word">Wonderful, Counselor</span>. It has been proposed to unite these two expressions and translate, "Wondrous Counselor" (compare "wonderful in counsel," <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>). But Dr. Kay is probably right in saying that, if this had been the meaning, it would have been expressed differently. Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, and Vance Smith agree with Dr. Kay in taking the words separately. <span class="accented">Wonderful</span>. The Messiah would be "wonderful" in his nature as God-Man; in his teaching, which "astonished" those who heard it (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a>); in his doings (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>); in the circumstances of his birth and death; in his resurrection, and in his ascension. "Wonder" would be the first sentiment which his manifestation would provoke, and hence this descriptive epithet is placed first. As the Word, as Wisdom itself, as he who says, "Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am Understanding" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>), he is well named "Counselor." None will ever seek his counsel in vain, much less repent of following it. <span class="cmt_word">The mighty God</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">Mighty God</span>; but the difference is not great, since <span class="accented">El</span>, God, contains within itself the notion of singularity, which is given to ordinary nouns by the article. The term <span class="accented">El</span>, God, had been previously applied to the Messiah only in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>. It denotes in Isaiah always (as Mr. Cheyne observes) "divinity in an absolute sense; it is never used hyperbolically or metaphorically." <span class="cmt_word">The Everlasting Father</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Everlasting</span> or <span class="accented">Eternal Father</span>. But here, again, there is a singularity in the idea, which makes the omission of the article unimportant; for how could there be more than one Everlasting Father, one Creator, Preserver, Protector of mankind who was absolutely eternal? If the term "Father," applied to our Lord, grates on our ears, we must remember that the distinction of Persons in the Godhead had not yet been revealed. <span class="cmt_word">The Prince of Peace</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Prince of Peace</span>. A "Prince of Peace" had been long shadowed forth, as in Melchizedek, "King of Salem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "of Peace;" and again in Solomon, "the peaceful one;" and Isaiah himself had already prophesied the peacefulness of the Messiah's kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). Compare the song of the angels at our Lord's birth (<a href="../../par/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). If the peacefulness has not vet very clearly shown itself, the reason would seem to be that our Lord's kingdom has yet to come into the hearts of most men.

The continual spread of Christianity tends to the accomplishment of this prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom.</span> That the Messiah is to sit on the throne of David, suggests, but does not absolutely imply, his Davidic descent. That descent is, however, announced with sufficient clearness in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To order it, and to establish it</span>. A <span class="accented">gradual</span> establishment of the kingdom would seem to be implied, such as is taught also in the parables of the mustard seed and the leaven. <span class="cmt_word">From henceforth even forever</span>. The kingdom is to be both universal in respect of extent (see the first note on the verse), and in respect of duration eternal. <span class="cmt_word">The zeal</span>; or, <span class="accented">jealousy</span>. God's jealousy of his own honor, which is bound up with the prosperity and final triumph of his people over all their enemies, will assure the performance of all that is here prophesied.

The remainder of this chapter, together with the first four verses of the next, seems to have formed originally a distinct and separate prophecy. The passage is a poem in four stanzas, with the same refrain at the end of each: "For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still." A somewhat early date has been assigned to the prophecy, as; for instance, "some period in the reign of Jotham" (Cheyne); but the internal evidence only proves that it was written before the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob... Israel.</span> These words do not show that the prophecy is directed against the kingdom of Israel only. "Jacob" designates Judah rather than Israel in <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3, 5, 6</a>; and the expression, "both the houses of Israel," in <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>, shows that the term "Israel" embraces both kingdoms.

Sycamore wood was the commonest sort of timber, cedar the scarcest and most precious, having to be imported from Phoenicia (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>).

"Against him" means "against Ephraim," or the kingdom of Israel. "The adversaries of Rezin" could only be the Assyrians; but these seem precluded by the next verse, which mentions only "Syrians" and Philistines." Hence many critics accept the variant reading of several manuscripts <span class="accented">sarey</span> for <span class="accented">tsarey - which</span> gives the sense of "the <span class="accented">princes</span> of Rezin" (so Lowth, Ewald, Houbigant, Weir, Cheyne).

The Semitic races regarded the world as looking to the rising sun, and used for the east the preposition signifying "in front,"  for the west that signifying "behind." Syria seems to have been hostile to Samaria until the league was formed between Rezin and Pekah, and may have become hostile again after Pekah's death (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>). We read of a Philistine invasion of Judah in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>), but not of their attacking Israel.

Both the peoples were led into idolatry by their rulers, but Israel especially. Jeroboam, the first king, introduced the calf-worship, and his <span class="accented">successors</span> from first to last persisted in his sin. Ahab added the still grosset idolatry of Baal. Those who held high position under the kings were equally bad examples to the people (see above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>:3). Are destroyed. First, morally corrupted and debased, then physically given over to destruction - slaughtered by Philistines, Syrians, and Assyrians.

He can have no joy or delight in evil-doers, or idolaters, or in those whose speech is profanity. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows</span>. The widow and the orphan are objects of God's tenderest love and compassion (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, etc.); but when the wickedness of a land provokes him to send any one of his "four sore judgments" upon it, the widow and the fatherless must suffer with the other inhabitants. God pities them, doubtless, but his justice and his righteous anger force him to restrain his pity, and carry out his judgment in spite of it. <span class="cmt_word">Every one is an hypocrite</span>; or, <span class="accented">corrupt</span>; compare, "<span class="accented">They</span> are <span class="accented">all</span> gone aside, they are <span class="accented">all together</span> become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, <span class="accented">not one"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>). A certain allowance must be made for the natural hyperbole of strong feeling. <span class="cmt_word">Every mouth speaketh folly</span>. The word translated here (and generally) "<span class="accented">folly"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> rendered "<span class="accented">villany"</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>.

The root used occurs in Arabic in this sense. It is not used elsewhere in Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">The people shall be as the fuel of the fire</span>. Though the general ravage, devastation, and desolation of the laud, with its buildings, its trees, and its other vegetable products, is included in the image of the fire devouring the thorny brakes and tangled thickets of a dense forest, yet the threat is intended still more against the Israelite <span class="accented">people</span>, who were the true "fuel of the fire," since the ravage would go on until the land should be depopulated. <span class="cmt_word">No man shall spare his brother</span>. We have here a new feature. Not only shall foreign enemies - Syrians and Philistines - dew, up Israel, but the plague of civil war will also be let loose upon them (comp. ver. 21, and see <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, where we find that Pekah fell a victim to a conspiracy headed by Hoshea).
