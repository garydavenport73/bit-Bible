A foreign conquest, accompanied by slaughter, and the deportation of captives, is not obscurely intimated. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 20, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, etc.).

It was certainly prevalent in Judah, it may also have been practiced in Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And that write grievousness</span>, etc. Translate, <span class="accented">and unto the writers that enregister oppression</span>. The decrees of courts were, it is clear, carefully engrossed by the officials, probably upon parchment, every outward formality being observed, while justice itself was set at naught.

These were the classes who were the chief sufferers by the perversion of justice (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 23</a>). They were exactly the classes for whom God had most compassion, and whom he had commended in the Law to the tender care of his people (see note on Isaiah 9:17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation <i>which</i> shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the day of visitation</span>? "The day of visitation" is the day when God reckons with his servants, and demands an account from each of the work done in his vineyard, being prepared to recompense the good and punish the bad (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>). It is oftenest used in a bad sense because, unhappily, so many more are found to deserve punishment than reward<span class="cmt_word">. The desolation which shall come from far</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the crashing ruin</span> (Cheyne). It is sudden, and complete destruction, rather than mere desolateness, that is threatened. Previous prophecies, especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-20</a>, had informed the Jews that it was to "come from far," "by them that were beyond the river." <span class="cmt_word">To whom will ye flee</span>? The prophet speaks in bitter irony. Is there any one to whom ye can flee? any one who can protect you from the wrath of God? Ye well know there is no one. <span class="cmt_word">Where will ye leave your glory</span>? With whom will ye deposit your riches, your magnificence, your jewels, your grand apparel? You cannot save them. They will all make to  themselves wings, and "fly away like a bird" (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Without me</span>. That this is a possible rendering of the word used seems proved by <a href="../../par/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>. But here it scarcely suits the context. God does not speak directly, in the first person, elsewhere in the entire prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-10:4</a>), but is spoken of in the third person throughout, as even in the present verse, where we have "his anger," "his hand." It is better, therefore, to give the word its ordinary meaning - "unless," "except." Have they anywhere to flee to, unless they shall crouch amid the captives that are being carried off, or fall amid the slain? In other words, there is no escape for them; they must either submit to captivity or death. <span class="cmt_word">For all this</span>, etc. Even when the two kingdoms were destroyed, and the captivity of both was complete, God's wrath was not fully appeased, his anger was not wholly turned away. Both peoples suffered grievous things in their captivity, as appears from the Book of Daniel (<a href="../../par/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3, 6</a>.) and other places. It took seventy years for God's anger to be appeased in the case of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), while in the case of Israel it was never appeased. Crushed beneath the iron heel of their conquerors, Israel ceased to exist as a nation. SECTION V. PROPHECIES OF WOE UPON FOREIGN NATIONS (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-23</a>) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-19.</span> - ASSYRIA, AFTER BEING GOD'S INSTRUMENT TO PUNISH ISRAEL, SHALL HERSELF BE PUNISHED IN HER TURN. The wicked are a sword in the hand of God (<a href="../../par/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>), wherewith he executes his judgments; but this fact is hid from them, and they imagine that they are successful through their own strength and might. So it was with Assyria (vers. 5-14), which its long career of victory had made proud and arrogant above measure. God now, by the mouth of Isaiah, makes known his intention of bringing down the pride of Assyria, and laying her glory in the dust, by a sudden and great destruction (vers. 15:19), after she has served his purposes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Assyrian</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Ho! Asshur</span>. "Asshur" is the nation personified, and is here addressed as an individual. The transition from vers. 1-4 is abrupt, and may be taken to indicate an accidental juxtaposition of two entirely distinct prophecies. Or Assyria may be supposed to have been in the prophet's thought, though not in his words, when he spoke of "prisoners" and "slain" in the first clause of ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of mine anger</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>, where it is said of Babylon, "Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war; for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy the kingdoms"). So Assyria was now the "rod" wherewith God chastised his enemies. The true "staff" in the hand of Assyria, wherewith she smote the peoples, was "God's indignation." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will send him against an hypocritical nation</span>; or, <span class="accented">against a corrupt nation</span>. Israel in the wider sense, inclusive of Judah, seems to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">The people of my wrath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the people who are the object of my wrath." <span class="cmt_word">Will I give him a charge</span>. In <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-25.htm">2 Kings 18:25</a> Sennacherib nays, "Am I come up without the Lord (Jehovah) against thin, lace, to destroy it? The Lord (Jehovah) said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it" (compare below, <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-10.htm">Isaiah 36:10</a>). It has been usual to consider Sennacherib's words a vain boast; but if God instructed Nebuchadnezzar through dreams, may he not also by the same means have "given charges" to Assyrian monarchs? <span class="cmt_word">To take the spoil, and to take the prey</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to gather spoil</span>, <span class="accented">and seize prey</span>. The terms used carry the thoughts back to <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-4</a>, and to the symbolic name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz. <span class="cmt_word">And to tread them down</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to make it a trampling</span>. "It" refers to "nation" in the first clause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but <i>it is</i> in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit he meaneth not so</span>. "Assyria," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "does not view the matter in this light - is not aware that she is merely God's instrument in working out his will. On the contrary, it is in her heart to destroy the nations for her own advantage, and she imagines that she is doing it by her own strength." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">For he saith, <i>Are</i> not my princes altogether kings?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are not my princes altogether kings</span>? One mark of the superiority of Assyria to other countries was to be seen in the fact that her king had not mere officers, but vassal kings under him. Hence the title "king of kings" assumed by so many Assyrian monarchs. While conquered territories were by degrees and to a certain extent absorbed into the empire and placed under prefects (see the 'Eponym Canon'), an outer zone of more loosely organized dependencies was always maintained by the Assyrians; and these dependencies continued ordinarily to be administered by their native monarchs (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 524-526). These are the "princes" who were "altogether kings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> not Calno as Carchemish? <i>is</i> not Hamath as Arpad? <i>is</i> not Samaria as Damascus?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not Calno as Carehemish</span>? A further proof of superiority, and ground of confidence, lay in the further fact, that the strongest cities had, one and all, succumbed to the Assyrian arms, and been laid in ruins to punish them for offering resistance. Six such cities are mentioned - Calneh, probably Niffer, in Lower Mesopotamia; Carchemish, on the right bank of the Euphrates in Lat. 36&deg; 30' nearly; Hamath, the "great Hamath" of Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>), in Coelesyria on the routes; Arpad, perhaps Tel-Erfad, near Aleppo; Damascus, and Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Calneh</span> was one of the cities of Nimrod (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>), and, according to the LXX., was "the place where the tower was built." It may have been taken by Tiglath-Pileser in one of his expeditious into Babylonia. Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>) speaks of it as desolate in his day. <span class="cmt_word">Carchemish</span> (Assyrian <span class="accented">Gargamis</span>) was a chief city of the Hittites, and has been called "their northern capital." Long confounded by geographers with Circesium at the junction of the Khabour with the Euphrates, it has recently been proved to have occupied a far more northern position, and is now generally identified with the ruins discovered by Mr. George Smith at Jerabis or Jerabhs. It was conquered by Sargon in  <span class="date">B.C. 717</span>, when "its people were led captive, and scattered over the Assyrian empire, while Assyrian colonists were brought to people the city in their place; Carchemish being formally annexed to Assyria, and placed under an Assyrian governor" (G. Smith, 'Assyria,' p. 97). <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span> was originally a Canaanite city (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>). By the time of David it had become the scat of an independent monarchy (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9, 10</a>), and so continued until its reduction by the Assyrians. We find it leagued with the Hittites, the Syrians of Damascus, and the Israelites against Assyria about  <span class="date">B.C. 850</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 361-363). About  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span> it was taken by Sargon, who beheaded its king, and probably reduced it to ruins (ibid., p. 411; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>). The name remains in the modern <span class="accented">Hamah</span>, where many curious inscriptions have been recently dug up. <span class="cmt_word">Arpad</span> was attacked by Tiglath-Pileser in the early part of his reign, and reduced to subjection. It revolted in conjunction with Hamath from Sargon, and was severely punished ('Ancient Monarchies,' l.s.c.). <span class="cmt_word">Is not Samaria as Damascus?</span> This mention of Samaria among the subjugated and ruined cities may undoubtedly be prophetic; but the connection with Carchemish, Hamath, and Arpad all of them towns reduced by Sargon within the years  <span class="date">B.C. 720-717</span> - points rather to the verse being historical, and would seem to indicate that the date of the entire prophecy - vers. 5-19  - is subsequent to the capture of the cities, and so not earlier than  <span class="date">B.C. 716</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols.</span> "Found" here means "reached," "punished... subjugated." It is quite in accordance with Assyrian ideas that the conquered countries should be called "kingdoms of the idols" (literally, "no gods"). The Assyrian monarchs regarded their own gods as alone really deserving of the name, and made war very much with the object of proving the superiority of their deities over those of their neighbors. Hence their practice of carrying off the idols from the various cities which they conquered, or else of inscribing on them "the praises of Asshur." <span class="cmt_word">And whose graven images</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and their graven images</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Did excel</span>. In preciousness of material or in workmanship, or both. The Assyrians went near to identifying the idols with the gods themselves. <span class="cmt_word">Those of Jerusalem and of Samaria</span>. The chief Samaritan idols were the golden calves at Dan and Bethel; but, in addition to these, "images and groves were set up in every high hill and under every green tree" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>), images of Baal, and Ashtoreth, and perhaps Beltis, and Chemosh, and Moloch. Even in Judah and in Jerusalem itself there were idols. Ahaz "made molten images for Baalim" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>). The brazen serpent was worshipped as an idol at Jerusalem until Hezekiah destroyed it; and probably, even after the reformation of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), many Jews retained privately the images, which he required them to destroy (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). Isaiah had already declared, speaking of Judah rather than of Israel, "Their land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-11.htm">Isaiah 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I not... so do to Jerusalem and her idols</span>? The speaker ignores the fact of any difference in kind between the religion of Judaea and that of the neighboring countries. He speaks as if he knew nothing of any religion without idols. No doubt Assyrian ideas on the subject of the religion of the Jews were at this time, as they were even later (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-22.htm">2 Kings 18:22</a>), exceedingly vague and incorrect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. The final result shall be such as "the Assyrian" little expected. <span class="cmt_word">When the Lord hath performed his whole work.</span> The "work" assigned to Assyria was the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, and a share in the trial, punishment, and discipline of Judah. The last task seems to have been the humiliation of Manasseh, which brought about his repentance (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11-13</a>). Soon after this the troubles began which led to her destruction. <span class="cmt_word">I will punish</span>. The sudden change from the third to the first person is harsh and abnormal, but not without parallels in other passages of Isaiah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-3.htm">Isaiah 5:3, 4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The fruit of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">stout heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the actions, language, etc., which flowed from the stoutness of heart - such language, e.g., as that of vers. 8-11 and 13, 14. <span class="cmt_word">Of the King of Assyria</span>. The menace is not leveled against any one particular king, as Sargon, or Sennacherib; but against the monarchy itself, which from first to last was actuated by the same spirit, and breathed the same tone, of pride, selfishness, and cruelty. (See the royal inscriptions, <span class="accented">passim</span>, which become more revolting as time goes on.)

Neither this speech nor that in vers. 8-11, nor again that given in <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24, 25</a>, is to be regarded as historical in the sense of being the actual utterance of any Assyrian monarch. All are imaginary, speeches, composed by the prophet, whereby he expresses in his own language the thoughts which Assyrian kings entertained in their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">I have removed the bounds of the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of peoples</span>. Assyrian monarchs take as one of their titles "the remover of boundaries and landmarks" (G.

The plunder of conquered countries is constantly recorded by the Assyrian monarchs as one of the most important results of each successful expedition. It is not infrequently represented in the sculptures (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 85). <span class="cmt_word">I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</span> The passage is obscure; and many different renderings have been given. Perhaps the best is that of Mr. Cheyne, "I have brought down, like a mighty one, those that sat on thrones." <span class="accented">Abbir</span>, however, the word translated "a mighty one," as often means "a bull" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-13.htm">Psalm 50:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>).

The Assyrians are fond of comparing their enemies to birds ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. pp. 36, 62, etc.); but the exact metaphor here used does not, I believe, occur in the inscriptions. The nations' treasures are like eggs found in deserted nests, which the hunter gathers without any, even the slightest, risk. <span class="cmt_word">All the earth</span>. Oriental hyperbole. Assyrian monarchs often say that they "have subdued all the races of men," or "carried the glory of their name to the ends of the earth," or "overthrown the armies of the whole world in battle." <span class="cmt_word">Peeped</span>; rather, <span class="accented">chirped</span> (see note on Isaiah 8:19).

A continuation of ver. 12, showing what the nature of Assyria's punishment shall be. The prophet expresses it by two images - first, that of a wasting sickness; and secondly, that of a fire. The first image expresses that gradual decay of national spirit which saps the vital strength of a nation; the second is more suited to denote some external attack under which the weakened nation should succumb. There are traces, in the later history of Assyria, both of increasing internal weakness through luxury and effeminacy, and of violent external attacks culminating in the combined Median and Babylonian invasion, before which her power collapsed (Abyden. ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 9; Syncell., 'Chronograph.,' p, 210, B; Tobit 14:15). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light of Israel</span>. A new name of God. The idea on which it is based may be found in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>), and again in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>). God enlightens his people, cheers them, comforts them spiritually, as the light of the sun enlightens, cheers, and comforts men physically. Christ, as true God, is "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be for a fire.</span> As the same material fire which gives light, warmth, and comfort may burn and destroy, so the spiritual light, finding fit material, scorches and consumes.

It shall be as complete, as terrible, and as final. <span class="cmt_word">In one day</span>. Scarcely "in one battle" (Cheyne); for the destruction of Assyria was effected by many battles, many sieges, and much exhausting ravage. "In one day" rather means "at one and the same time,"  "within a brief space." It is not to he taken literally.

"Forest" and "fruitful field" (<span class="accented">carmel</span>) are sometimes united together, sometimes contrasted. Literally, they denote wild and cultivated woodland. Used symbolically, as here, they are not so much intended to designate different parts of Assyria's glory, as to convey the idea that the destruction will be universal. <span class="cmt_word">Both soul and body.</span> Here metaphor is suddenly dropped, and Isaiah shows that he is speaking of the Assyrian <span class="accented">people</span>, not of the land or its products. Their destruction, wicked as they were, would be one both of body and soul. <span class="cmt_word">As when a standard-bearer fainteth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as when one that is faint fainteth</span>.

The remnant, however, shall <span class="accented">be but</span> a remnant - judgment shall have overtaken the balk of the people (vers. 22, 23). Still, there is reason for the faithful to take courage and be of good heart; Assyria will shortly receive a check (vers. 24-27) - when her armies swoop upon Jerusalem, God will swoop down on her (vers. 28-34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "at that time"  - the time of the destruction of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Israel</span> (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>).

The promise had been made to Abraham that his seed should be "like the sand of the sea for multitude" (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). This promise had been fulfilled (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>); but now the sins of the people would produce a reversal of it. It would be a remnant, <span class="accented">and only a remnant</span>, of the nation that would escape. Judah would have to make a fresh start as from a new beginning (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the consummation</span> (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>) <span class="accented">determined on is one that overflows with righteousness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>).

Isaiah uses the metaphor of the "scourge" again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16, 18</a>. It is rare in Scripture, though common among the Greek and Latin writers. <span class="cmt_word">According to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>). The "slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb" was that great destruction of the Midianites which was begun by the three hundred under Gideon, and completed by the men of Ephraim, whereof we have an account in <a href="../../par/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-25</a>. Its counterpart in Assyrian history would seem to be the destruction of Sennacherib's army, as related in <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As his rod was upon the sea</span>. An allusion to the drowning of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea. This was a nearer parallel to the destruction of Sennacherib's army than the slaughter of the Midianites, since it was wholly miraculous. By "his rod" we may understand the rod of Moses, endued by God with miraculous powers (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After the manner of Egypt</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "after the manner of his action in Egypt."

Isaiah sees it in vision (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>), and describes it like an eye-witness. There are at present no sufficient means of deciding to what particular attack it refers, or indeed whether the march is one conducted by Sennacherib or Sargon. Sargon calls himself in one inscription "<span class="accented">conqueror</span> of the land of Judah" (Layard, 'Inscriptions,' 33:8), and the details of the present prophecy, especially ver. 9, suit the reign of Sargon rather than that of his son, so that on the whole it is perhaps most probable that some expedition of Sargon's is portrayed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is come to Aiath</span>. "Aiath" is probably Ai (<a href="../../par/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-28</a>), with a feminine termination. It lay about three miles south of Bethel, which had become Assyrian with the conquest of Samaria. If an Assyrian army mustered at Bethel, it would naturally enter Judaean territory at Ai. <span class="cmt_word">He is passed to Migron</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he has passed through Migron</span>. "Migron" is mentioned as a village in the territory of Gibeah of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>); but the Migron of this passage must have been further to the north. <span class="cmt_word">He hath laid up his carriages</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "has left his baggage-train." Michmash was about seven miles nearly due north of Jerusalem. The heavy baggage might conveniently be left there, especially as it was difficult of attack (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4-13</a>), while a lightly equipped body of troops made a dash at Jerusalem.

The "passage of Michmash" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23</a>) - the deeply sunken valley, called now the <span class="accented">Wady Sutveinit</span>, between Michmash (<span class="accented">Mukkmas</span>) and Geba (<span class="accented">Jeba</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>They have taken up their lodging at Geba</span>; or, <span class="accented">at Geba they rest for the night</span>. Having crossed the wady, they bivouac on the crest of the hills enclosing it on the south. <span class="cmt_word">Ramah... Gibeah of Saul</span>. Ramah is, no doubt, <span class="accented">Er-Ram</span>, a village on an eminence, as the name implies, about six miles north of Jerusalem, and on the direct road from Beitin. Gibeah of Saul is thought to have occupied the site of the modern <span class="accented">Tuleil-el-Ful</span>, two miles nearer Jerusalem. It is certainly a distinct place from Geba. The inhabitants evacuate these two places during the night.

Gallim and Laish must have been villages between Geba and Jerusalem; but it is impossible to fix their site. Anathoth (now <span class="accented">Aaata</span>) obtains mention in Joshua as a city of refuge in the territory of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>). It was Jeremiah's birthplace (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). Gallim was the birthplace of the man who became the second husband of Michal, Saul's daughter.

The Assyrians pitch their camp at Nob, the priestly city destroyed by Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>), 1 which was evidently within sight of Jerusalem.
