The prophet, having (in <a href="../../par/isaiah/25.htm">Isaiah 25</a>.) poured forth his own thankfulness to God for the promise of the Church's final redemption and triumph, proceeds now to represent the Church itself in the glorified state as singing praise to God for the same. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. In the "day of God" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>), the period of the "restitution of all things" (<a href="../../par/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Judah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the "new earth" - whose city will be the "heavenly Jerusalem," and wherein will dwell "the Israel of God" - the antitype whereof the literal "land of Judah" was the type. <span class="cmt_word">A strong city</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a city of strength</span>. In the Revelation of St. John the new Jerusalem is represented as having "a wall great and high" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>), and "twelve gates," three on each side. The intention is to convey the idea of complete security. In the present passage the city has "gates" (ver. 2), but no "walls" - <span class="cmt_word">walls and bulwarks</span> being unnecessary, since the saving might of God himself would be its sure defense against every enemy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a></div><div class="verse">Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Open ye the gates</span>. The command is given by God to his angels within the city, or perhaps by some angels to others, to "open the gates," and let the saints march in and take possession (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/118-19.htm">Psalm 118:19, 20</a>, which seems to represent the same occasion; and <a href="../../par/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7-10</a>, which tells of another occasion on which the angelic warders were bidden to throw open the gates of the celestial city. <span class="cmt_word">The righteous nation which keepeth the truth</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">righteous nation</span>. A people, made up of all kindreds and nations and tongues, which should henceforth be "the people of God" They are "righteous," as washed clean from all taint of sin in the blood of the Lamb. They "keep the truth," or "keep faithfulness," as under all circumstances clinging loyally to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thou wilt keep <i>him</i> in perfect peace, <i>whose</i> mind <i>is</i> stayed <i>on thee</i>: because he trusteth in thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wilt keep him</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">the steadfast mind thou wilt keep in peace</span>, <span class="accented">in peace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in perfect peace" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7, 8</a>). The writer's mind throughout the first paragraph of his" song" (vers. 1-4)"is running" (as Mr. Cheyne well observes) "on the security and immovableness of the new Jerusalem." All is peace and sure defense on God's side; all is trust and perfect confidence on the side of man. The first words of the verse may be taken in various ways - the above rendering (which seems to us the best) is that of Delitzsch and Kay. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a></div><div class="verse">Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH <i>is</i> everlasting strength:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Trust ye in the Lord</span>. The faithful exhort each other to perfect trust, in the new Jerusalem, as in the old (see <a href="../../par/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the Lord Jehovah</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in Jab Jehorah</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is everlasting strength</span>; literally, <span class="accented">is the Rock of ages</span>. A certain refuge throughout all eternity is, no doubt, intended (see the comment on Isaiah 17:10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a></div><div class="verse">For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, <i>even</i> to the ground; he bringeth it <i>even</i> to the dust.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He bringeth down</span>; rather, he <span class="accented">hath brought down</span>. The redeemed praise God for his past mercies. He brought down in his own good time all the proud and lofty ones who exalted themselves against him and oppressed his saints, making cities desolate (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10, 12</a>) and giving over their inhabitants to destruction (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-6.htm">Isaiah 24:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Them that dwell on high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that exalt themselves." It is net eminence, but pride, that provokes the Divine anger. The heathen judged differently (see Herod., 7:10, &sect; 4). <span class="cmt_word">The lofty city</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2, 3</a>). The "world-city" (as it has been called); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the idealized stronghold of the adversaries of God in this world, is intended. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-6.htm">Isaiah 26:6</a></div><div class="verse">The foot shall tread it down, <i>even</i> the feet of the poor, <i>and</i> the steps of the needy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The foot shall tread it down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">trode it down</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the feet of God's people, the weak and afflicted of this world, trod down ultimately, or brought to destruction and ruin, the great world-power - not so much that they were victorious in an actual physical contest, as that they, finally triumphed through God's judgment on the world-power, which brought it to naught, and left it for his people to show their contempt by trampling upon the smoking ruins. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">The way of the just <i>is</i> uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of the just is uprightness</span>; or, <span class="accented">the path for the just is straight</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is one of the main blessings of the righteous that God "makes their way straight before their face" (<a href="../../par/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), "leads them in a plain path" (<a href="../../par/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>), "shows them the way they are to walk in" (<a href="../../par/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>), so that they are for the most part free from doubt and perplexity as to the line of conduct which it behooves them to, pursue. If this is so in the present life, still more will it be the uniform condition of the just in another sphere. Then God will of a surety "direct <span class="accented">all</span> their paths" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou, most upright, dost weigh</span>; literally, O <span class="accented">upright One</span>, <span class="accented">thou dost weigh</span>. The term "upright" is applied to God in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>; and <a href="../../par/psalms/92.htm">Psalm 92</a>:16. By "weighing the path of the just" is meant keeping it, as Justice keeps her scales, straight and level. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of <i>our</i> soul <i>is</i> to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, in the way of thy judgments... have we waited for thee</span>; rather, we <span class="accented">waited</span>. During the long years of our affliction and persecution in the world, we waited in the constant expectation that "thy judgments" would fall upon our persecutors. We were not impatient. We knew that thou wouldst visit us at the tilting time. <span class="cmt_word">The desire of our soul is to thy Name</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the desire of our soul was to thy Name</span>. During all the weary time of waiting, we longed for thee, and thy Name, or rather what thy Name indicates, thy own true self. In default of thy actual presence, we desired to have thee ever in remembrance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a></div><div class="verse">With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments <i>are</i> in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the night</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the long night of their affliction." The sentiment is identical with that of the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Will I seek thee early</span>; rather, <span class="accented">did I seek thee</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For when thy judgments</span>, etc. It was not a mere selfish desire for the cessation of persecution that caused the righteous to long for the time when God's judgments would be manifested upon the earth, but a conviction that so only would an impression be made on the persecutors, and a certain number of them be induced to <span class="cmt_word">learn righteousness.</span> A desire for the conversion of sinners to God characterizes God's saints generally, and none more than Isaiah, who is here expressing what he conceives will be the thoughts of the redeemed, and naturally judges their thoughts and feelings by his Own. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a></div><div class="verse">Let favour be shewed to the wicked, <i>yet</i> will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let favor be showed to the wicked.</span> This is a further explanation of the reason why the righteous had so earnestly desired the coming of God's judgments upon the earth. They had felt that further mercy and long-suffering wine thrown away upon the wicked, and "only did them harm" (Kay). When "favor was showed them," they did but persist in unrighteousness. <span class="cmt_word">In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly.</span> Even good example does not convert the wicked man. Though he live in a "land of righteousness," where God and his Law are acknowledged, where true religion is professed, where the gospel is preached, he will continue wicked, he will "deal unjustly;" <span class="cmt_word">he will not behold</span> - or, <span class="accented">consider - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the majesty of the Lord</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a></div><div class="verse">LORD, <i>when</i> thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: <i>but</i> they shall see, and be ashamed for <i>their</i> envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thy hand is lifted up, they will not see.</span> The original is more graphic. It runs, "Lord, thy hand is lifted up, [but] they see not. They shall see to their shame thy jealousy for thy people; yea, fire shall devour thy adversaries" God's jealousy "burns like fire" (<a href="../../par/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>) in the cause of his people.

The "work" intended seems to be, as Mr. Cheyne observes, "the work of their deliverance." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD our God, <i>other</i> lords beside thee have had dominion over us: <i>but</i> by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Other lords</span>. The saved had not always been faithful to Jehovah. Some, no doubt, had actually been idolaters, as many of the early Christians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>, etc.). Others had given their hearts for a time to other vanities, and turned away from God. Now, in the new Jerusalem, they confess their short comings, and acknowledge that only through God's mercy - by thee - are they in the condition to celebrate his Name. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a></div><div class="verse"><i>They are</i> dead, they shall not live; <i>they are</i> deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are dead</span>, etc.; literally. <span class="accented">Dead</span>, <span class="accented">they shall not live</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> return to life); <span class="accented">deceased</span>, <span class="accented">they shall not arise</span>. The power of the idol-gods is altogether passed away. It was for this end - <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span> - that God had <span class="cmt_word">visited and destroyed them, and made their very memory to perish</span>. How strange it seems that the "great gods" whom so many millions worshipped in former times - Bel, and Asshur, and Ammon, and Zeus, and Jupiter - should have passed so completely away as to be almost wholly forgotten! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-15.htm">Isaiah 26:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed <i>it</i> far <i>unto</i> all the ends of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast increased the nation</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "righteous nation" of ver. 2 - not the Jewish people merely, but "the Israel of God" - who are to be "a great multitude, that no man can number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues" (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hadst removed it.</span> This rendering gives a very good sense. It makes the redeemed pass in thought from their present state of happiness and glory to that former time of tribulation and affliction when they were a remnant, scattered over the face of the earth (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13-15</a>), driven into its uttermost corners (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>), oppressed and down-trodden by their enemies. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear the rendering. Most modern commentators translate, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> hast extended far all the borders of the land," which is certainly the more natural meaning of the words. If we accept this view, we must regard the clause as continuing the idea contained in the former part of the verse - the nation is increased in number, and its borders are advanced - it is "a multitude that no man can <span class="accented">number</span>," and it has no narrower limits than the "<span class="accented">new</span> earth," which has been given to it for its habitation (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a></div><div class="verse">LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer <i>when</i> thy chastening <i>was</i> upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, in trouble have they visited thee</span>. Here, at any rate, the redeemed go back in thought to their time of trouble. They remember that what brought them back to God from that alienation which they have confessed (ver. 13) was the affliction which they so long endured. Their present bliss is the result of their former woe, and recalls the thought of it. <span class="cmt_word">They poured out</span> <span class="cmt_word">a prayer</span>; rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">a secret speech</span>, or <span class="accented">a low whisper</span> (Kay); comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>. The word elsewhere means "the muttering of a <span class="accented">charm</span>," but must here signify the "<span class="accented">whispered</span> prayer" of one in deep humiliation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17</a></div><div class="verse">Like as a woman with child, <i>that</i> draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, <i>and</i> crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like as a woman with child</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>). Isaiah uses the metaphor to express any severe pain combined with anxiety. <span class="cmt_word">So have we been in thy sight</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so have we been at thy presence</span>. When thou wert visiting us in anger, and laying thy chastisements upon us.

That downfall was God's work (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16-20</a>).

Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew <i>is as</i> the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-21.</span> - THE PROPHET'S COMMENT ON THE SONG OF THE JUST. Having concluded his "<span class="accented">song</span> of the just" in a minor key with a confession of human weakness, the prophet proceeds to cheer and encourage his disciples by a clear and positive declaration of the doctrine of the resurrection: "Thy dead, O Israel, shall live." He then adds a recommendation for the present - a recommendation to privacy and retirement, until the judgments of God which he has predicted (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>.) are shown forth upon the earth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy dead men shall live</span>. A universal resurrection of" some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (<a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>), is not yet announced; but only a resurrection of the just, perhaps only of the just Israelites. The object is encouragement, especially encouragement of those whom the prophet directly addresses - the religious Israelites of his own day. It is enough for them at the present time to know that, whether the day of the Lord comes in their time or no, when it <span class="accented">comes</span>, they will have a part in it. The assurance is given, and is made doubly sure by repetition. The prophet does not say, Together with <span class="cmt_word">my dead body</span> they will arise; for there is nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to "together," and the ellipse of '<span class="accented">ira</span>, "<span class="accented">with</span>," though suggested by Kimchi, is impossible; nor is it likely that he intends to speak of his own dead body at all. He may, perhaps, call the past generations of just Israelites "my dead," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dead with whom he is in sympathy; or the supposed personal suffix may be merely paragogic, as Rosenm&uuml;ller argues. In any case the two clauses must be regarded as identical in meaning - an instance of "synonymous parallelism.... Thy dead men shall live; my dead shall arise." <span class="cmt_word">Awake and sing</span>; rather, <span class="accented">awake and shout for joy</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/35-27.htm">Psalm 35:27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/67-4.htm">Psalm 67:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye that dwell in dust</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, "Many <span class="accented">that sleep in the dust of the earth</span> shall awake"). <span class="cmt_word">Thy dew is as the dew of herbs</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refreshing, vivifying, potent to make even dead bones live. "Thy dew" may be said with reference to Jehovah, for changes in the person addressed are frequent in Isaiah; or with reference to the people of Israel, meaning, "the dew which Jehovah will shed on thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on thy dead.

As when a storm comes, prudence counsels men to seek shelter (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-19.htm">Exodus 9:19</a>), so now the prophet advises his people to put themselves under cover during the coming tempest. His meaning, probably, is that they should retire into the privacy of communion with God, withdrawing from public affairs and the distractions of a worldly life. <span class="cmt_word">Shut thy doors about thee</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For a little moment</span> (so in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>; and again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7, 8</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a></div><div class="verse">For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord cometh out of his place</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>). In the Psalms God is represented as "bowing the heavens and coming down," bringing them, as it were, with him. Here (and in Micah) he quits his place in heaven, as a king quits his own country when he proceeds to take vengeance on rebels in another. The expressions are, both of them, accommodations to human modes of thought. <span class="cmt_word">To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The earth also shall disclose her blood</span>; literally, <span class="accented">her bloods</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her bloodsheddings; the many murders committed by man upon her surface. Isaiah denounced "murderers" in his first chapter (ver. 27). Manasseh's murders were the main cause of the first destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>). The second destruction was equally a judgment for the innocent blood that had been shed upon the earth, "from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Bars-chins" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>). Bloodshed "cries to God for vengeance" (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>), and will be one of the main causes of the world's final destruction (<a href="../../par/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And shall no more cover her slain</span>. "There is nothing covered that shall not" in the last day "be revealed, and hid that shall not be known" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>). Every murder, however secret, will be brought to light, and every murderer, however unsuspected previously, denounced and punished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/25.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 25"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 25" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/27.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 27"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 27" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
