Some regard the speaker in this chapter as Jehovah; some as the prophet, or the prophetical order; some as "the Servant." The last supposition appears to us the simplest and the best. The close connection with the preceding chapter is evident. If that then be, in the main, "a soliloquy of the Servant," this should he a continuation of the soliloquy. Israel is promised "righteousness," "glory," "a new name," a guard of angels, a time of peace and prosperity, deliverance from Babylon, and triumphant establishment in Zion under God's protection. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace</span>. In the past God has kept silence (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>). "The Servant" has not caused his voice to be heard. Babylon has been allowed to continue her oppression unchecked. But now there will be a change. God will lift up his voice, and the nations will hear; and the "salvation" of Israel will be effected speedily. For Jerusalem's sake. "Zion" and "Jerusalem" are used throughout as synonyms (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4, 5</a>, and 9; 33:20; 40:9; 41:27; 52:1; 64:10, etc.), like "Israel" and Jacob." Strictly speaking, "Zion" is the mountain, "Jerusalem" the city built upon it. Until the righteousness thereof go forth (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10, 11</a>). As brightness; or, as <span class="accented">the dawn</span> (comp <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Salvation...  as a lamp that burneth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a torch that blazeth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2.htm">Nahum 2</a>:14; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-6.htm">Zechariah 12:6</a>). Israel's "salvation" would be made manifest; primarily by her triumphant return from Babylon, and more completely by her position in the final kingdom of the Redeemer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Gentiles shall see</span>, etc. A continuation of the account of Israel's final glory, as given in <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6-9</a>. What the Gentiles are especially to see and admire is Israel's righteousness. This may point to those acknowledgments of the purity and excellence of the early Church which were made by the heathen (Plin., 'Epist.,' 10:97), and which culminated in the saying, "See how these Christians love one another!" The sceptic Gibbon acknowledges, among the causes of the success of Christianity, "the virtues of the early Christians." All kings (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-22.htm">Psalm 50:22</a>:11). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called by a new name</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 12; and see also <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>). It is not altogether clear what the "new name" is, since in the remainder of the present chapter more than one name is suggested. Rosenmuller supposes" Hephzibah" to be meant. Dr. Kay suggests "the holy people," and notes that the title of "holy ones," or "saints," is given by St. Paul to all Christians (<a href="../../par/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-15.htm">Romans 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>, etc.). Mr. Cheyne thinks that it is some unknown title of honour, akin to that mentioned by Jeremiah "Jehovah our Righteousness" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>). "New names" will be given to individual saints in the heavenly kingdom (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-3.htm">Isaiah 62:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt also be a crown of glory</span>, etc. God will exhibit Israel to an admiring world, as a man might exhibit a "crown" or "diadem" which he held in his hand. They will look on with admiration and reverence - "for they shall perceive that it is his work" (<a href="../../par/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken</span>. Judah had believed herself" forsaken" of God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a>), and had actually been, in a certain sense, forsaken "for a small moment" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>). Her enemies, it would seem, had gone so far as to give her the name in derision<span class="cmt_word">. Neither shall thy land ...  be termed Desolate</span>. Judaea had not only been desolated by the Babylonian invaders under Nebucbarlnezzar, but had remained "desolate" during the whole period of the Captivity (<a href="../../par/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a>, etc.). It had come to be spoken of as <span class="accented">Sh'marnah</span>, "a desolation" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Jeremiah 34:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-29.htm">Ezekiel 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>). Now all should be altered. As Ezekiel prophesied, "The land that was <span class="accented">desolate</span> is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my delight is in her." Hephzi-bah was the name of Hezekiah's queen, Manasseh's mother (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy land Beulah</span>. Beulah, or rather Be'ulah, means "married" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>). Judaea would be "married" to her sons, or her people, when they quitted Babylon and once more took possession of her. The Hebrew verb toe "to marry" (as a man marries) means literally "to be lord over." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a></div><div class="verse">For <i>as</i> a young man marrieth a virgin, <i>so</i> shall thy sons marry thee: and <i>as</i> the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, <i>so</i> shall thy God rejoice over thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride</span>. There is a double employment of the analogy with marriage here. The land, Judaea, personified as a female, is married to her sons, or her people, regarded (in this connection) as a male. The people,   regarded as a female ("the virgin daughter of Zion," <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>) is also married to Jehovah, and recognizes him as her Bridegroom (Comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). As Bridegroom, God calls his bride "Hephzi-bah" - "my delight is in her." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a></div><div class="verse">I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, <i>which</i> shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set watchmen upon thy walls</span>. "The Servant" has appointed watchers upon the walls of Zion - either "prophets" (Delitzsch), or "priests and prophets" (Kay), or, more probably, "angelic beings" (Cheyne), who keep perpetual watch and ward (Comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>). Neither <span class="cmt_word">day nor night</span> do they <span class="cmt_word">hold their peace</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">keep silence</span>, but ever intercede with God for his people, like the "angel of Jehovah" in <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>, reminding him of his covenant with them, and his promises to them, and exhorting him to "awake, awake" for his own honour's sake (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9-11</a>). It is generally allowed that the "watchers" in <a href="../../par/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13, 17, 23</a> are angels; and the same interpretation best suits the "watchmen" of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Ye that make mention of the Lord</span>; rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">ye that are the Lord's remembrancers</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "ye whose business it is to call to God's remembrance the needs and claims of his people, and the obligations of his covenant promises." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-7.htm">Isaiah 62:7</a></div><div class="verse">And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give him no rest</span>. Compare the teaching of our Lord with respect to the efficacy of importunity (<a href="../../par/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn <i>to be</i> meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath sworn</span>. In answer to the representations of the "remembrancers," God solemnly binds himself by an oath to come to the relief of the people, to restore them to their own land, and to give them the enjoyment of its fruits in peace. <span class="cmt_word">By his right hand</span>. God commonly swears "by himself" (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>), or "by his holiness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>). Once he swears "by his great Name" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>), and once "by the excellency of Jacob" (<a href="../../par/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>). There is no other place in Scripture where he swears "by his right hand and arm" - emblems of his power to act. <span class="cmt_word">Thy corn...  thy wine;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fruits of thy land. Hitherto, even when Israel was in possession of Palestine, its fruits were constantly destroyed, or carried off, by the raids of hostile neighbours. Henceforth this plundering should cease.

This is not to be understood literally, at any rate, of the whole produce of the laud. What is meant is, that the produce will be consecrated by such festal means as the Law enjoined (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-27</a>), and that then the remainder will be consumed with due thanks and acknowledgments. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a></div><div class="verse">Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go through, go through the gates</span>. The speaker returns to the period of the exile, and exhorts the people to pass forth from Babylon, and speed on their way homewards (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11</a>). Some of them are to clear away obstacles, others are to bring materials and construct a highway along which the stream of emigrants may march (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>), while a third body removes such stones as might cause stumbling, and a fourth lifts up a standard to direct the march. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward <i>is</i> with him, and his work before him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Meanwhile Jehovah, by his angels or his prophets, causes it to be made known to the ends of the earth that the redemption of Israel draws nigh, and that Zion's" salvation" approaches<span class="cmt_word">. His reward is with him</span>, etc. The words are repeated from <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>. Here they are certainly said of Israel. They go forth from Babylon, having their reward with them - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> liberty, honour, riches to some extent (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-4.htm">Ezra 1:4-11</a>), and their work, or rather their <span class="accented">recompense -</span> the possession of Palestine - before them.

So did Alexander, according to Josephus. The Romans, on the contrary, regarded them as the votaries of a degrading superstition. Since the Roman conquest, they have been almost universally despised. Perhaps the prophecy may be considered to still await its complete fulfilment. Thou shalt be called. "Thou" refers to Zion or Jerusalem. She should be called Sought out - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a special object of God's care - and A city not for-saken - the very opposite of her former name (ver. 4), which was "Forsaken."
