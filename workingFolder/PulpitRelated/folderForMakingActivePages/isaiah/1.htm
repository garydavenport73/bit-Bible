It is questioned whether the title can be regarded as Isaiah's, or as properly belonging to the work, and it is suggested that it is rather a heading invented by a collector who brought together into a volume such prophecies of Isaiah as were known to him, the collection being a much smaller one than that which was made ultimately. In favor of this view it is urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the prophecies, as we have them, do not all "concern Judah and Jerusalem;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is a mistake in the title, which Isaiah could not have made, none of the prophecies belonging to the reign of Uzziah. But it may be answered, that, in the scriptural sense, <span class="accented">all</span> and Jerusalem, prophecy "concerns Judah and Jerusalem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people and city of God; and, further, that it is quite impossible to prove that no part of the "vision" was seen in the reign of Uzziah. There are no means of knowing whether Isaiah collected his prophecies into a volume himself or whether the collection was the work of others. In either case, the existing title must be regarded as designed for the entire work. All the earlier prophecies - those of Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, and Zephaniah - have some title introducing them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vision</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>). The term is probably used in a collective sense, but is also intended to suggest the intrinsic unity of the entire body of prophecies put forth by Isaiah. As prophets were originally called "seers" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>), so prophecy was called "vision;" and this latter use continued long after the other (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-15.htm">1 Chronicles 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Isaiah the son of Amoz</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-1.htm">Isaiah 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-2.htm">Isaiah 37:2</a>; etc.; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-32.htm">2 Chronicles 32:32</a>). The signification of the name <span class="accented">Isaiah</span> is "the salvation of Jehovah." The name Amen (<span class="accented">Amots</span>) is not to be confused with Amos ('<span class="accented">Amos</span>), who seems to have been a contemporary (<a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</span> The prophecies of Isaiah concern primarily the kingdom of Judah, not that of Israel. They embrace a vast variety of nations and countries (see especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13, 15</a>. - 21, 23, 47.); but these nations and countries are spoken of "only because of the relation in which they stand to Judah and Jerusalem" (Kay), or at any rate to the people of God, symbolized under those names. Jerusalem occupies a prominent place in the prophecies (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a>. 1-8; 31:4-9, etc<span class="cmt_word">.). In the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.</span> Uzziah (or Azariah, as he is sometimes called) reigned fifty-two years - probably from  <span class="date">B.C. 811</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>; Jotham sixteen years - from  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>; Ahaz also sixteen years - from  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>; and Hezekiah twenty-nine years - from  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>. Isaiah probably prophesied only in the later years of Uzziah, say from  <span class="date">B.C. 760</span>; but as he certainly continued his prophetical career tin Sennacherib's invasion of Judaea (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-5.htm">Isaiah 37:5</a>), which was not earlier than  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, he must have exercised the prophet's office for at least fifty-six years. The lowest possible estimate of the duration of his ministry is forty-seven years  - from the last year of Uzziah,  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>, to the fourteenth of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>). The highest known to us is sixty-four years  - from the fourth year before Uzziah's death ( <span class="date">B.C. 762</span>) to the last year of Hezekiah ( <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - GOD'S COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS PEOPLE. The groundwork of Isaiah's entire prophecy is Judah's defection from God. God's people have sinned, done amiss, dealt wickedly. The hour of vengeance approaches. Punishment has begun, and will go on, continually increasing in severity. National repentance would avert God's judgments, but the nation will not repeat. God's vengeance will fall, and by it a remnant will be purified, and return to God, and be his true people. In the present section the indictment is laid. Judah's sins are called to her remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth</span>. "A grave and magnificent exorilium! All nature is invoked to hear Jehovah make complaint of the ingratitude of his people" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The invocation is cast in the same form with that so common in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1), and seems to indicate familiarity with that book. The idea extends widely among sacred and other poets (see <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1, 2</a>; Aesch., 'P. V.,' 11. 88-92). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath spoken</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord</span> (literally, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented">speaketh</span> (so Lowth, Cheyne, and Gesenius). The speech of Jehovah follows in vers. 2, 3. <span class="cmt_word">I have nourished and brought up children</span>; literally, (<span class="accented">my</span>) <span class="accented">sons I have made great and high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have raised Israel to greatness and exalted him among the nations. Notwithstanding their disobedience, God still acknowledges them as his "sons." <span class="cmt_word">They have rebelled against me.</span> The verb used is generally rendered in our version "transgressed" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>); but it may also have the stronger sense here assigned it. Lowth translates, "revolted from me;" Gesenius, "fallen away from me;" Cheyne, "broken away from me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: <i>but</i> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ox... the ass.</span> The ox and the ass are probably selected as the least intelligent of domesticated animals (so Jerome, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and Gesenius). Yet even they recognize their owner or master. Jeremiah contrasts the brutish stupidity of Israel with the wise instinct of animals that have not been domesticated, as the stork, the turtle-dove, the crane, and the swallow (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Israel doth not know;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> does not acknowledge its Master and Owner, pays him no respect, does not recognize him as either Owner or Master. <span class="cmt_word">My people.</span> Compare the formula, so frequent in Exodus, "Let <span class="accented">my people</span> go" (Exodus 7:16; 8:1, 20; 9:1, etc.). Israel was God's people by election (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>), by covenant (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>), by pardoning grace (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12-17</a>). Despite all their backslidings, he had not yet cast them off. They are still "his people" in Isaiah from first to last, standing in contrast with "the nations, "or "the Gentiles, "among whom they are to be "set as a sign" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Doth net consider.</span> Gesenius translates, "doth not consider <span class="accented">thereof</span>;" Cheyne, "is without understanding." Bishop Lowth retains the words of the Authorized Version. The meaning would seem to be, "My people doth not consider <span class="accented">me</span>, cloth not reflect on my relation to them as Lord and Master."

The prophet, having delivered God's message in vers. 2 and 3, proceeds to impress and enforce it on the people by remarks of his own. He begins with a lamentation over their wickedness and impenitence; "Ah sinful nation!" or "Alas for the sinful nation! "the nation called to be holy (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, etc.), but sunk in sin and wickedness.

It is not their corrupting of others, though that might follow, but the corruption that was in themselves, which is spoken cf. The corruption was both moral and doctrinal (see ver. 21). In corroboration of the fact, see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They have forsaken</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord.</span> Not by renouncing his worship, which they still continued (see vers. 11-15), but by reducing it to a formality.

We find it thrice in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/71-22.htm">Psalm 71:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>); once in Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a>), but then in the mouth of Isaiah; twice in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:29; 51:5); and once in Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>). According to Isaiah's conception of God, holiness is the most essential element of his nature (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3, 5, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They are gone away backward</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they are estranged backwards</span>; or, as Bishop Lowth paraphrases, "they are estranged from him; they have turned their back upon him."

Note the use of the singular number in the original. <span class="cmt_word">They have not been closed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they have not been pressed</span>; which is explained to mean (Aben Ezra, Kay) that they have not had the matter formed by suppuration pressed out of them. <span class="cmt_word">Neither bound up</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not bandaged, <span class="cmt_word">Neither mollified with ointment</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with oil</span>. <span class="accented">On</span> the treatment of wounds and ulcers with oil m ancient times, see 'Hippocrat., De Ulceri. bus,' &sect; 4; Galen., 'De Compos.

Recent medical science has revived the practice, and wounds of all kinds are now frequently treated with nothing but carbolic oil.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Your country <i>is</i> desolate, your cities <i>are</i> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <i>it is</i> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your country is desolate.</span> Metaphor is now dropped, and the prophet describes in strong but simple language the judgments of God, which have already followed the sins of the nation. First of all, their land is "a desolation." It has been recently ravaged by an enemy; the towns have been burnt, the crops devoured. There is nothing to determine who the enemy had been. Knobel supposes the Edomites and Philistines, who invaded Judaea in the time of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17, 18</a>), to be intended; Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests the Israelites under Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21-24</a>); while Mr. Cheyne supposes the devastation to have been wrought by the Assyrians under Sargon. If we could be assured that the prophecies of Isaiah are arranged in chronological order, we should either have to accept Rosenm&uuml;ller's view, or to suppose some invasion of Judaea to have taken place in the later years of Uzziah of which no mention is made by the authors of Kings and Chronicles; but it is impossible to be certain on what principle Isaiah's prophecies are arranged. The mention of "strangers" is in favor of the enemy having been actual foreigners, and therefore not the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Your cities are burned with fire.</span> The common fate of cities taken in war. In the Assyrian sculptures we often see the torch applied to them. <span class="cmt_word">Your land.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, "your <span class="accented">tillage</span>." <span class="accented">Adamah</span> means "soil" or "ground" generally; but here no doubt denotes the ground which bore crops. <span class="cmt_word">Strangers devour it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "foreigners" others than the sons of the soil - not necessarily persons of a different race, but still probably such persons. <span class="cmt_word">In your presence</span>; before your eyes, as you look on - an aggravation of the affliction. It is <span class="cmt_word">desolate, as overthrown by strangers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it is a desolation</span>, <span class="accented">like an overthrow by strangers</span>. The near approach to repetition displeases moderns, who conjecture <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that <span class="accented">zarim</span>, strangers, has another meaning, and should be here translated by "inundation" or "deluge" (Aben Ezra, Michaelis, Lowth); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it is a wrong reading, and should  Be altered into <span class="accented">sodim</span>, a word not <span class="accented">very</span> different (Ewald, Cheyne). But "the return to words whose sounds are yet lingering in the ear" is characteristic of ancient writing, and a favorite practice of Isaiah's (Kay). The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore stand.

The "remnant" is that of the few godly men who still inhabit Jerusalem.

The prophet supposes the people, by the mouth of their rulers, to meet the charge of rebellion with an appeal to the fact that they maintain all the outward ordinances of religion, as required by the Lawn and are therefore blameless. This draws from him a burst of indignant eloquence, which the Holy Spirit directs him to put, mainly, into the mouth of God (vers. 11-15), denouncing such a pretence of religion as an aggravation of their sin, and characterizing their whole worship as an "abomination." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear the word of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Do not <span class="accented">speak to</span> no purpose, but hear." The rulers are supposed to have begun their plea, but the prophet stops them. <span class="cmt_word">Ye rulers of Sodom.</span> Having said in the preceding verse how nearly Jerusalem had suffered the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, the writer grows more bold, and proceeds to give Jerusalem the obnoxious names. Her "rulers, "literally, <span class="accented">judges</span> (<span class="accented">katsin</span> in Hebrew corresponding to <span class="accented">kadi</span> in Arabic), are "rulers of Sodom;" her people are the "people of Gomorrah." There is as much wickedness, though it may be not the same wickedness, in "the daughter of Zion" at the existing time, as in the cities of the plain when God destroyed them. <span class="cmt_word">The law of our God.</span> Not the Levitical Law, though the word used has generally that sense, but the "instruction" or "direction" that was about to be uttered (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>; and see below, <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a> and Isaiah 51:4).

"Thinkest thou that I will eat the flesh of bulls, and drink the blood of goats? "(Psalm 1:13). God "delights not in burnt offerings." From the time of Samuel he had declared, "Behold, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). David had said of him, "Sacrifice and meat offering thou wouldest not; burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required" (<a href="../../par/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8, 9</a>); and again, "I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt offerings, because they were not always before me. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat out of thy folds; for all the beasts of the forest are mine, and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills" (<a href="../../par/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8-10</a>). Not, of course, that either David or Isaiah desired to abolish sacrifice, or had any commission so to do; but they were, both of them, anxious to impress on men that sacrifice, <span class="accented">by itself</span>, was nothing - that self-dedication, self-renunciation, true devotion of the heart, with its necessary concomitant obedience, must accompany sacrifice, for God to be pleased therewith. The sacrifices of a people such as is described in vers. 21-23 could not but be an offence to him. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord.</span> The phrase employed is unusual, and almost confined to Isaiah, occurring elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>. Isaiah uses it again in ver. 18, and also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>; and Isaiah 66:9. It is explained to be emphatic, implying that this is what God says, and will say,  concerning the matter in hand, once and forever (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">I am full of the burnt offerings of rams</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I am overfull</span>, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, <span class="accented">wearied with them</span>. Barns formed a part of the required sacrifice on all great occasions, as at the Passover (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19</a>), at the Feast of Weeks (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-27.htm">Numbers 28:27</a>), at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36</a>), at the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2</a>), and on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-8.htm">Numbers 29:8</a>). They were commanded as the sole sacrifice for a trespass offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16, 18</a>). Under David were offered on one occasion "a thousand rams" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-21.htm">1 Chronicles 29:21</a>); and the occasions where seven rams formed the legitimate sacrifice were many. Unaccompanied by a proper frame of mind, each such offering was an offence to God, displeased him, wearied him. <span class="cmt_word">The fat of fed beasts.</span> The fat was always regarded, both by the Hebrews and the Greeks, as especially suitable for sacrifice. It was burnt upon the altar in every case, even where the greater part of the victim was consumed as food (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3, 10</a>, etc.; note particularly the expression in <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>, "All the fat is the Lord's"). "Fed beasts" are those which were kept separate in stalls or sheds for some time before the sacrifice, and given food in which there was nothing" unclean." The Paschal lambs were required to be thus separated and fed for four days (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I delight not in the blood.</span> The blood, "which is the life" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>), was to be sprinkled on the altar in every sacrifice of a victim. This sprinkling was of the very essence of the sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6, 17, 25, 30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Bullocks... lambs... he-goats.</span> These, together with rams, constituted all the sacrificial beasts of the Hebrews.

The requirement of the Law was still observed in the letter, but not in the <span class="cmt_word">spirit</span>. They came with no true religious object. Hence the question which follows: <span class="cmt_word">Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span> <span class="accented">This</span> was not what God had enjoined - a mere bodily attendance, a <span class="accented">trampling</span> of his courts with their feet, when their hearts were far from him.

But incense symbolized prayer (<a href="../../par/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>); and if no heartfelt prayer accompanied its use, it was emptied of all its significance, and became hateful to God - a <span class="accented">mere</span> form, and consequently an "abomination." <span class="cmt_word">The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with</span>. The weekly festival of the sabbath, the monthly one of the "new moon, "and the annual "assemblies" or "solemn feasts" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>), were the main occasions of Jewish worship. As at this time conducted, God could endure none of them; all were tainted with the prevalent unreality. The construction of the passage is highly rhetorical, and indicates great excitement of feeling. Kay translates it literally, "New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, I cannot - it is ungodliness - even the solemn meeting." The authors of the Revised Version also suppose an aposiopesis. <span class="cmt_word">The solemn meeting.</span> The word thus translated is applied only to particular days in the great festival seasons, as to the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>), and the seventh day of the Passover (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a>), or else to days specially appointed for religious services by civil authority (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-9.htm">2 Chronicles 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>).

But cruelty and oppression, producing poverty and wretchedness, and tending to shorten life, are no doubt also included (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10, 11</a>).

God, having put aside the worthless plea of outward religiousness made by his people, goes on to declare, by the mouth of his prophet, what he requires. First, in general terms (ver. 16), and then with distinct specification (ver. 17), he calls on them to amend their ways, both negatively ("cease to do evil") and positively ("learn to do well"). If they will really amend, then he assures them of forgiveness and favor; if they refuse and continue their rebellion, the sword will devour them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wash you, make you clean</span>. The analogy of sin to defilement, and of washing to cleansing from sin, has been felt among men universally wherever there has been any sense of sin. Outward purification by water has been constantly made use of as typical of the recovery of inward purity. Hence the numerous washings of the Levitical Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7, 8, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a>; etc.); hence the ablutions of the priests in Egypt (Herod., 2:37); hence the appropriateness of the rite of baptism; hence the symbolical washing of hands to free from complicity in blood-guiltiness (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>). "Wash you, make you clean, "could not be misunderstood by the Israelites; they would know that it was a requirement to "wash their hands in innocency" (<a href="../../par/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>), even apart from what follows. <span class="cmt_word">Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.</span> Not "hide it, "for that was impossible; but remove it altogether - in other words, "cease from it."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-31.</span> - THE DECLARATION OF GOD'S JUDGMENT. It is foreknown to God that Israel will not repent. He therefore fulminates his judgment; which, however, is still conditional, so far as individuals are con-corned. His vengeance will fall upon the land; but the result will be twofold. Destruction will come upon the unrighteous and the sinners (ver. 28) - they will be "consumed" (ver. 28), and "confounded" (ver. 29); but there will be some on whom the punishment will have a purifying power, whose dross it will purge away, and whom it will convert to God (vers. 25, 27). From these will rise up a new Jerusalem - a "city of righteousness," a "faithful stronghold" (ver. 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord, the Lord of hosts</span>. In the original, <span class="accented">Ha-Adon</span>, <span class="accented">Jehovah Sabaoth - i.e.</span> "The Lord" (or "Master" of men and angels), "the Self-Existing One of the hosts of heaven" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, their God, the only proper object of their worship. It gives peculiar weight and significance to this prophecy, that it is introduced by a triple designation of the Divine Being. <span class="cmt_word">The Mighty One of Israel.</span> A very unusual designation, only found here and, with the modification of "Jacob" for "Israel, "in the following places: <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2, 5</a>. God's might would be shown alike in his vengeance on his enemies, and in his purification of a remnant to serve him. <span class="cmt_word">I will ease me of mine adversaries</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I will comfort me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will rid myself of them, and so obtain the only comfort that they will allow me to receive from them (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>, "I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted").

Certainly the post-Captivity Church was "faithful" to Jehovah, in the way of acknowledging him, and him only, to be God, to a very remarkable degree, and in strong contrast to its inclination during pro-Captivity times.
