There are comparatively few who deny that, in this place at any rate, the "Servant of the Lord" is the Messiah. (So the Targum on the passage; so Abar-barnel; so, among moderns, Oehler, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne.) The portraiture has "so strong an individuality and such marked personal features, that it cannot possibly be a mere personified collective;" and it goes so "infinitely <span class="accented">beyond</span> anything of which a man was ever capable that it can only be the future Christ" (Delitzsch). It may be added that St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-17.htm">Matthew 12:17-21</a>) distinctly applies the passage to our Lord. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> -  <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>. "Behold," as Mr. Cheyne says, "invites the attention of the world - both of the Jews and of the nations  - to a new revelation." It looks back to the similar expression of vers. 24 and 29 of the preceding chapter, which draw down the curtain upon the idol-gods, while this "behold" reveals One who is to occupy their place, and to be a worthy object of the worship of mankind, <span class="cmt_word">My Servant</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my true and perfect servant, utterly obedient (<a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2</a>); not, like Israel, my rebellious and faithless servant; not, even, like my prophets, yielding an imperfect  obedience, <span class="cmt_word">Whom I uphold</span>. "As the Father hath life in himself, so <span class="accented">hath he given</span> to the Son to have life in himself" (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). As the fount or origin of Divinity (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), the Father supports and sustains even the Son and the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">Mine Elect</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>). Christ was "chosen" from all eternity in God's counsels to the great work of man's redemption, and to be the Mediator between God and man. <span class="cmt_word">I have put my Spirit upon him</span> (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; and for the fulfilment, comp. <a href="../../par/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-34.htm">Luke 3:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "he shall publish," or "cause to be published, to the Gentiles, the true Law of God - religion on its practical side." The publication of Christianity throughout all the world has abundantly fulfilled this promise or prophecy. The call of the Gentiles had been already declared by Isaiah in his earlier preaching (ch. 2:2; 11:10; 19:22-25; 25:6; 27:13, etc.).

Supply, after "lift up," "his voice" from the next clause. His methods shall be quiet and gentle. He shall not seek to recommend his teaching by clamour or noisy demonstrations. There shall be a marked unobtrusiveness in all his doings (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-30.htm">Matthew 9:30</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-15.htm">Matthew 12:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-13.htm">John 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>, etc.).

Egypt was compared to a "bruised reed" by Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>), as being untrustworthy and destitute of physical strength; but here the image represents the weak and depressed in spirit, the lowly and dejected. Christ would deal tenderly with such, not violently. <span class="cmt_word">Smoking flax shall he not quench</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the wick which burns dimly</span> (margin) <span class="accented">he shall not quench.</span> Where the flame of devotion burns at all, however feebly and dimly, Messiah will take care not to quench it. Rather he will tend it, and trim it, and give it fresh oil, and cause it to burn more brightly. <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring forth judgment unto truth</span>. But with all this tenderness, this "economy," this allowance for the shortcomings and <span class="accented">weaknesses</span> of individuals, he will be uncompromising in his assertion of absolute justice and absolute truth. He will sanction nothing short of the very highest standard of moral purity and excellence. (For an instance of the combination of extreme tenderness with unswerving maintenance of an absolute standard, see <a href="../../par/john/8-8.htm">John 8:8-11</a>.)

As a "Light" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-9</a>), he will burn brightly and strongly; as a Reed, or Rod, he will be firm and unbroken. <span class="cmt_word">Till he have set judgment in the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till he has succeeded in establishing true religion upon the earth (compare the last clause of ver. 1). The isles; or, <span class="accented">the countries</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1, 5</a>). Shall wait for his Law; or, <span class="accented">shall long for his Law. Yakhal</span> is "to wait longingly." It is, as Delitzsch observes, "an actual fact that the cry for redemption runs through the whole human race." They are possessed by "an earnest longing, the ultimate object of which is, however unconsciously, the Servant of Jehovah, and his instruction from Zion" ('Comment. on Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 177). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith God the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thus saith the</span> (<span class="accented">One</span>) <span class="accented">God</span>, <span class="accented">Jehovah.</span> The entire utterance, vers. 1-4, is the utterance of God; but, as that fact is gathered by inference, not asserted, the prophet suddenly stops, and makes a new beginning. It must be made perfectly clear that the announcement of the "Servant of the Lord" and his mission are from the Almighty; and so we have the solemn announcement of the present verse. <span class="cmt_word">He that created the heavens</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The earth, and that which cometh out of it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all that the earth produces - gold, and silver, and precious stones, and corn, and wine, and luscious fruits, and lovely flowers - all that sustains life, and all that makes life delightful - nay more, <span class="accented">life</span> itself - the breath and the spirit that make men living beings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a></div><div class="verse">I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I the Lord have called thee in righteousness</span>. The "Servant of Jehovah" is addressed. God has "called" him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> appointed him to his mediatorial office "<span class="accented">in righteousness</span>," in accordance with the righteous purpose which he has entertained towards his fallen creatures from the beginning of the world. <span class="cmt_word">And will give thee for a Covenant of the people</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). The covenant between God and his people being in Christ, it is quite consistent with Hebrew usage to transfer the term to Christ himself, in whom the covenant was, as it were, embodied. So Christ is called "<span class="accented">our</span> Salvation" and "our <span class="accented">Peace</span>," and again, "our Redemption" and "our Life." This is the ordinary tone of Hebrew poetry, which rejoices in personification and embodiment. A prose writer would have said that the Servant of the Lord would be given as the Mediator of a covenant between Jehovah and his people. <span class="cmt_word">For a light of the Gentiles</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-4.htm">Isaiah 51:4</a>).

The Messiah was to cure both physical and. spiritual blindness (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-3.htm">Isaiah 32:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, etc.). Here it is spiritual blindness that is specially intended, as appears both by the symbolic language of the two  conjoined clauses, and by the comment of vers. 16-19. <span class="cmt_word">To bring out the prisoners from the prison</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to bring out prisoners.</span> To deliver from the bondage of sin such as are its slaves, and shut up in its prison-houses.

Jehovah is still the speaker. He begins by promising a new revelation (ver. 9). Then, before the revelation is made, he calls upon the nations - especially those in the vicinity of Palestine  - to rejoice at what is about to happen (vers. 10-12). After this he proceeds to make the announcement promised in ver. 9  - an announcement that he is about to deliver his people (ver. 16) and to execute vengeance on their enemies (vers. 13-15 and 17). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the former things are come to pass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> former prophecies have been fulfilled. Israel has been led lute captivity, and in her captivity has suffered grievous things. The reference is, perhaps, especially to such prophecies as <a href="../../par/isaiah/39-5.htm">Isaiah 39:5-7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And new things do I declare</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>). The voluntary restoration of a captive people to their own land by the power to which they were subject, and which could compel their services, was emphatically a "new thing" in the world's history. How unwilling the sovereign power was ordinarily to lose such services may be seen by the narrative in Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5-14</a>.), and again by the account which Herodotus gives (1:73, 74) of the ground of quarrel between Alyattes and Cyaxares. <span class="cmt_word">Before they spring forth</span>; or, <span class="accented">shoot forth.</span> The metaphor is one taken from the vegetable world (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10</a></div><div class="verse">Sing unto the LORD a new song, <i>and</i> his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto the Lord a new song</span>. The call for a "new song" is based upon the ground that the mercy vouchsafed was a "new" one (see ver. 9). The expression is frequent in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His praise from the end of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let his praise be sung by all the inhabitants of the earth to its remotest bounds." <span class="cmt_word">The sea</span>. Sea and land are called upon equally to proclaim God's praise; the sea, "and its fulness" (margin) - those who frequent it in ships, and those who dwell on its shores and islands. The last clause, "the isles and the inhabitants thereof," is exegetical of the preceding one - " all that is therein." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a></div><div class="verse">Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up <i>their voice</i>, the villages <i>that</i> Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness and the cities thereof</span>. The desert had its cities, built on some more or less fertile oases, where at any rate water was procurable. Instances of such cities are Tudmor, Petra, Kadesh (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>). Its villages were probably collections of tents, which were moved from time to time, since the Beni-Kedar were nomads (ch. 21:16; <a href="../../par/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>). The call is upon both the stationary and the wandering inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert to join in the song of praise. <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of the rock</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the iahabitants of Sela</span>, or <span class="accented">Petra</span>, the rock-city, which was the capital of Idumaea, or Edom (see the comment on ch. 16. l). It is assumed that the return of the Israelites to their land <span class="accented">ought</span> to be a subject of rejoicing to all their neighbours.

The exhortation to "sing unto the Lord a new song" ends with ver. 12, and now the reason or groundwork for the exhortation has to be declared. God is about to make one of the great manifestations of his power upon the earth - to "<span class="accented">go</span> forth" against his enemies, and destroy and devour, and easily prevail against them - not, however, simply in the way of punishment and vengeance, but with a further merciful object. He will punish Babylon, that he may deliver Israel. He has promised not to forsake his people (<a href="../../par/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>). He is now about to give effect to his promise by a "new" and strange deliverance. He "will bring his people by a way that they knew not, and lead them in paths that they have not known" (ver. 16). It has been said that "in effect it is the day of judgment which is here described" (Cheyne); but this seems to be only so far true as every manifestation of God's wrath towards his enemies is a foreshadowing of  the great and awful day. The event directly in view is the destruction of the Babylonian power by the irresistible arms of Cyrus. Hence the allusion to idolaters and images in ver. 17. <span class="cmt_word">As a mighty man...  like a man of war</span>. (For similar anthropomorpbisms, see <a href="../../par/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He shall stir up jealousy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his own jealousy. God is "a jealous God" (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), so much SO that his very "name is Jealous" (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). He is jealous for his own honour (<span class="accented">supra</span>, ver. 8), and jealous also for his people's honour and reputation and happiness. Occasionally he allows his jealousy to slumber (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>:30, "The times of this ignorance God winked at"); and this he had now done for some fifty or sixty years, since his people were carried into captivity. But the time of acquiescence has gone by - he is about to waken up his "smouldering jealousy, and stir it, till it burns up into a bright flame" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">He shall cry, yea, roar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">yea</span>, <span class="accented">shout</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> utter his battle-cry with a clear, loud voice.

He has chafed, as it were, under the necessity of inaction, and has with difficulty refrained himself. Now he will refrain no longer. <span class="cmt_word">A travailing woman</span>. A woman in her travail, after long endurance, at last gives free vent to her natural feelings, and utters loud cries (compare the preceding verse). I will destroy and devour at once (so Gesenius, Kay, and the ancient versions). But the bulk of modern commentators render, "I will pant and gasp," as does a travailing woman.

The result of God's "stirring up his jealousy," and giving a free vent to his feelings, will be the destruction of the great and mighty ones of the earth (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-14.htm">Isaiah 2:14</a>). These are probably, in this place, the Babylonian kings and nobles. Dry up all their herbs; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> turn Babylonia, temporarily, into a desert. <span class="cmt_word">Make the rivers islands, and dry up the pools</span>. Invert the established order of things - turn the rivers into dry land, and empty the reservoirs. There is, perhaps, some allusion to those dealings with the river-beds, which the Greek historians ascribe to Cyrus (Herod., 1:189, 191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:5, &sect; 10), and which are not disproved by the fact that the one native account of the capture of Babylon by Cyrus, which has come down to us, makes no mention of them.

God promises to "bring them" out of captivity "by a way not hitherto known to them"  - the way of voluntary release by the favour of a new king (see the comment on ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">I will make darkness light before them</span>; either, <span class="accented">I will illuminate with rays of light and hope the dark and cheerless life that they have been leading</span> (Delitzsch), or, I <span class="accented">will throw light upon that dark future which has hitherto stretched before them</span>, <span class="accented">and allow them to penetrate its obscurity</span>, <span class="accented">and see what is about to happen. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Crooked things</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rough places</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> difficulties of any and every kind. Straight; rather, <span class="accented">smooth</span>, <span class="accented">level</span>, <span class="accented">flat</span>,<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them</span>. Dr. Kay translates, "These things <span class="accented">have I done</span>, and <span class="accented">have n</span>o<span class="accented">t forsaken</span> them;" Mr. Cheyne, "These are the things that I will do, and will not let them slip;" Delitzsch, "These are the things that I carry out and do not leave." According to the two latter renderings, the clause is a mere solemn confirmation of the previous promises. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a></div><div class="verse">They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye <i>are</i> our gods.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall be turned back</span>, etc. While the people of God are led by God's hand through new paths, and are illumined with abundant light, and have their difficulties smoothed away from before them. their idolatrous oppressors will be "turned back" or suffer defeat, and be put to shame, finding no help from their idols, whose powerlessness will be openly shown, to the utter confusion of their votaries. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18</a></div><div class="verse">Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-25.</span> - ADDRESS TO CAPTIVE ISRAEL, CALLING UPON THEM TO TURN TO GOD, AND REMINDING THEM THAT THEY HAVE DESERVED THEIR AFFLICTIONS. By some critics the earlier verses of this passage (vers. 19-21) are regarded as having reference to the "Servant of the Lord" depicted in vers. 1-7, and as calling on the captive Jews to consider his voluntary humiliation, and the object of it. But this view seems to be strained. It requires "deaf" and "blind' to be taken in completely different senses in the two consecutive verses, 18 and 19. Probably Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne are right in taking the whole passage of captive Israel, and especially of that "outer circle" which was least deserving of God's favour and most open to rebuke and reproach. These "blind" and "deaf" ones are warned that it is high time for them to unclose their eyes  and open their ears, and are reminded that all their recent and present sufferings arise from their former "blindness" and disobedience. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, ye deaf</span>. The "deaf" are not absolutely without hearing, nor the "blind" absolutely without sight. They can "hear" and "see," if they choose to do so. When they do not see, it is because they "wink with their eyes" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>); when they do not hear, it is because, like the deaf adder, they "stop their ears" (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-4.htm">Psalm 58:4</a>). This, at any rate, is the case with the majority. There may be some who have deadened their moral vision altogether, and have no longer any "ears to hear." God, however, addresses the mass of Israel as still possessed of moral discernment, if they will but use it, and calls upon them to wake up out of sleep - to "hear" and "see." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a></div><div class="verse">Who <i>is</i> blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger <i>that</i> I sent? who <i>is</i> blind as <i>he that is</i> perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger?</span> God's original "servant" and "messenger" to the nations was his people Israel. It was only through their default that he needed to send another and truer messenger. He now asks, having regard to their opportunities, who are so blind and deaf as they are? The object of the question is to wake a feeling of shame in the hearts of those who are not shameless among the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">That I sent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whom I will send.</span> Israel's mediatorial office was not yet over. They were still, for above five hundred years, to be God's messenger to the nations. <span class="cmt_word">As he that is perfect</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as he that receives reward from me</span> (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>). The word used is connected etymologically with the Arabic <span class="accented">muslim</span> (our "Moslem"); but it does not appear to have had the sense of "surrender" or "submission" in Hebrew.

They had had their ears open in a certain sense, and heard the words that the prophets addressed to them, but had not taken in their true import. (The mixture of persons is like that in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a> and Isaiah 14:30.)

It is not the original giving of the Law at Sinai only that is meant, but also its constant inculcation by a long series of prophets. Israel's experience (ver. 29) had included all this; but they had not profited by the instruction addressed to them.
