But there were exceptions to the rule. Wicked persecutors, like Ahab, Jezebel, and Athaliah, cut off the righteous ere they had seen half their days. So probably did Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3, 4</a>).

There is, no doubt, primarily, "<span class="accented">a</span> contrast to the awful troubles which the survivors will have to encounter" (Hengstenberg); but perhaps this contrast is not all that is meant. The "peace" is positive rather than negative, or it would scarcely be a consolation to any one.

The reference is, as Mr. Cheyne says, to the "orgiastic cults' in the sacred groves of Palestinian heathenism." The nature of these cults is well stated by Professor Dollinger ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 430): "At the spring festival, called by some the 'brand-feast,' by others that of torches, which was attended by streams of visitors from every country, huge trees were burnt, with the offerings suspended on them. Even children were sacrificed; they were put into a leathern bag, and thrown the whole height of the temple to the bottom, with the shocking expression that they were calves, and not children. In the fore-court stood two gigantic phalli. To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement; and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose<span class="cmt_word">." Slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks.</span> The sacrifice of their children to Moloch was largely practised by the Jews in the later period of the kingdom of Judah. It seems to have been originally introduced by the superstitious Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, who "made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). Suspended during the reign of Hezekiah, it was renewed under Manasseh, who followed the example of his grandfather in himself sacrificing one of his sons (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Under the last three kings it prevailed to a very wide extent, and the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel are loud in their denunciations of it (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2-6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>, etc.). Arguments have been brought forward to prove that the child was merely passed before a fire, or between two fires, and not burnt; but the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming (see the article on "Moloch" in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 2, pp. 403, 404). The rite belonged especially to the worship of Chemosh and Moloch by the Moabites and Ammonites (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>), from whom it was adopted by the Israelites (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7</a>) and Jews. The sacrifice was supposed to be expiatory (<a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). In the later times of the Jewish kingdom the place of sacrifice was the valley of Hinnom, west and north of Jerusalem, which is overhung by rugged rocks.

But, in the first place, there is no evidence that anciently these passages were understood literally, or that such inscriptions were ever set up; and secondly, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, they would have been more, rather than less, conspicuous in a new place. Probably, therefore, the "memorial" (<span class="accented">zikkaron</span>) of this place is some idolatrous symbol or emblem newly adopted by the Jews, and made use of as a sort of talisman. Many commentators think that it was of a phallic character (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>).

It is a feature of the idolatry of the time, that it was a mixture adopted from many quarters. It included Baal and Ashtoreth-worship from Phoenicia, Moloch-worship from Moab and Ammos, worship of the Queen of Heaven from Syria, high-place worship from the Canaanites, and stone-worship from their own remote Mesopotamian ancestors. And made thee a covenant with them; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a bargain for wages," that aid and protection should be rendered in return for worship and sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">Where thou sawest it</span>. The original is very obscure, but can scarcely have this meaning. It is certainly a distinct clause, and may perhaps be best translated, "thou sawest indecency."

But there is no indication of the Jews having put any trust in <span class="accented">Assyria</span> after the reign of Ahaz, to which this chapter, by its position in the prophecy, cannot belong. Moreover, the King of <span class="accented">Assyria is</span> never called simply" the king." It is, therefore, better to regard "the king" as Moloch, whom the Jews of Isaiah's time certainly worshipped (see ver. 5), and whose name was a mere dialectic variety of <span class="accented">Melech</span>, "<span class="accented">king"</span> (see Dean Payne Smith's ' Sermons on Isaiah,' sermon 4. p. 119). <span class="cmt_word">Ointment...  perfumes</span>.

The prophet, in this portion of his discourse, whereof "comfort" is the key-note (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>), can never continue threatening long without relapsing into a tone of tenderness and pity. He now sets against his long denunciation (in vers. 3-12) an ample promise (vers. 15-19), and against his brief encouragement (in vers. 13, 14) a short menace (vers. 20, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The ground of the promise of salvation in ver. 15 is God's combined might and mercy, which are now set forth. <span class="cmt_word">The high and lofty One</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where the same words are translated "high and lifted up"). In God's loftiness are included at once his exalted majesty and his almighty power. He is "high" in himself, transcending thought, and "lofty" or "lifted up" in that he is absolute Lord of his creatures, and therefore high above them. <span class="cmt_word">That inhabiteth eternity</span>. So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> But the Hebrew is less abstract, and would perhaps be best translated "that liveth eternally." <span class="cmt_word">I dwell in the high and holy place</span>. Solomon's "heaven of heavens" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), which, however, "cannot contain him;" St. Paul's "light which no man can approach unto" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); Zechariah's "holy habitation" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>). With him also that is of a contrite - literally, <span class="accented">crushed -</span> and humble spirit. "Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly "(<a href="../../par/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>); "He humbleth himself to consider the things that are in heaven and earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>). He is not an Epicurean Deity, too far exalted above man to have any regard for him, or concern himself with man's welfare (see <a href="../../par/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12, 13</a>). On the contrary, he condescends to "dwell with" man, only let man have a "humble" and "crushed," or "bruised," spirit. <span class="cmt_word">To revive the spirit of the humble</span>. When God condescends to visit the contrite and humble spirit, the immediate effect is to comfort, console, revive. His presence is a well of life. springing up within the soul to everlasting life (<a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).

If he were "extreme to mark what is done amiss," none could abide it (<a href="../../par/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>). He remits somewhat, therefore, from the claims of strict justice, and is content to take lower ground. Were it otherwise, man's spirit should fail before him. Man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, would be utterly unable to justify himself, and would faint and fade away before the Divine fury. The souls which God has made would, one and all, perish. He, however, has not made them for this purpose, but that they should live (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>); and has therefore devised for them a way of salvation (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a></div><div class="verse">For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth</span>. Among the sins that angered God most against the Jews of the later kingdom of Judah was their covetousness - that desire of unjust gain which led them continually to oppress their weaker brethren, to remove their neighbours' landmarks, to harass them with lawsuits, to obtain from the courts corrupt judgments against them, and so to strip them of their inheritances (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5, 14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>, etc.). This was far from being their only sin; but it was their besetting sin, and it led on to a number of others. It would seem even to have been the principal cause of those judicial murders with which they are so constantly taxed by the prophets (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15, 21</a>: 33:15; 59:3; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>). Isaiah selects the sin of covetousness here, as typical or representative of the entire class of Judah's besetting sins - the most striking indication of that alienation of their hearts from God, which constituted their real guilt, and was the true cause of their punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And smote him</span>. The form of the verb marks <span class="accented">repeated</span> action. God gave Judah many warning's before the final catastrophe. He punished Judah by the hand of Sargon, by that of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>), by that of Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), by that of Pharaoh-Necho (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>), by that of the Syrians, the Moabites and the Ammonites (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>), and others, during the hundred and forty years which intervened between the accession of Hezekiah and the completion of the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">I hid me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>).

God had seen the wanderings of his people in perverse ways, and his heart had been touched with pity thereat. The good Shepherd follows and recalls the wanderers of the flock. When they have suffered hurt he "heals" them. He is willing to "lead" them also - to go before   them, and show them the way that they should walk in (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>), and "restore comforts" to them, especially to such of them as have begun to "mourn" over their perversity.

Judah's prophets were apt to say to her, "<span class="cmt_word">Peace, peace</span>," when there was no peace (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-11.htm">Jeremiah 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>).
