It is thought by some that this vision, and its sequel, constitute the original call of Isaiah to the prophetical office, and in order of time precede all the other contents of the book. But the position of the "vision" in the book is strongly against this view. Prophets who relate their original call naturally place it in the forefront of their narrative (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>). It is quite possible, as Bishop Lowth says, that this was "a <span class="accented">new</span> designation, to introduce more solemnly a general declaration of the whole course of God's dispensations in regard to his people, and the fates of the nations." The vision itself may profitably be compared with Ezekiel's first vision, which it much resembles (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that King Uzziah died.</span> The year  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>, probably. We cannot determine from the phrase used whether the vision was seen before or after Uzziah's death. <span class="cmt_word">I saw also</span>; rather, <span class="accented">then it was that I saw</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/16-6.htm">Exodus 16:6</a>). The Lord. Not "Jehovah," as in vers. 3 and 5, but "Adonay," for greater reverence. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up.</span> The imagery is, of course, taken from the practice of earthly kings. Elaborate thrones were affected by the great monarchs of Egypt and Assyria (Lepsius, 'Deutmaler,' pt. 3. pls. 2, 76, 100, 121; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 150). Solomon's throne was perhaps even grander than any of these (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>). It was placed at the summit of "<span class="accented">six</span> steps," so that its occupant was "<span class="accented">high</span> and lifted up" above all his courtiers. <span class="cmt_word">His train.</span> Not his train of attendants, but "the skirts of his robe." Flowing robes were commonly worn by great monarchs. <span class="cmt_word">Filled the temple</span>; or, <span class="accented">the palace</span>. The same word is used in Hebrew for both. Dr. Kay supposes the prophet to be "in vision gazing on the actual temple - to see its veils drawn aside, and instead of the Shechinah enthroned on the cherubim, to behold the King of glory, enthroned on high, the fringes of his royal robe filling the temple, so that no human priest could minister there." But, as Mr. Cheyne observes, "palace is more in harmony with the picture than temple." It is the heavenly palace of the King of kings into which the prophet's gaze is allowed to penetrate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Above it stood the seraphims</span>; rather, <span class="accented">above him were standing seraphim</span>. The "seraphim" are introduced, not as well known, with the article, but without it, as unknown. The word means "fiery ones,"  and is supposed to denote the burning love of the blessed spirits spoken cf. They appeared to the prophet as standing above the King as he sat upon his throne - "standing" to show their readiness to minister; but why "above him" is not so clear. Perhaps, simply, as those that stand are "above" those that sit; perhaps as ready to fly through infinite space at the bidding of him who was seated in his palace, as it were upon the ground. Their form, as seen by the prophet, appears to have been human, and only distinguished from ordinary humanity by the wings. Thus, though in name they resembled those other "fiery ones," which had punished the Jews in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6-9</a>), there is nothing to show that Isaiah in any way connected the two. <span class="cmt_word">Each one had six wings</span>. Gesenius is mistaken in saying that there are at Persepolis any six-winged figures ('Thesaurus,' p. 1342). The Persians not infrequently represented their genii with four wings ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 353, 354); but no six-winged figures have been found, so far as I know, among the Persian remains. <span class="cmt_word">With twain he covered his face</span>, etc. The general idea of the six wings was probably rapid flight, the carrying out of God's behests "with speed swiftly." But, in the Divine presence, the wings were applied to a different use. One pair veiled the seraph's head from the intolerable effulgence of the Divine glory; another concealed the feet, soiled in their various ministrations, and unmeet for the all-pure presence; the third pair alone sustained the seraph in mid-air, as he hovered in readiness to depart on any errand on which Jehovah aright send him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts: the whole earth <i>is</i> full of his glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One cried</span>; rather, <span class="accented">kept crying</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>, "They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy"). But the prophet scarcely goes so far; he describes only his vision - they did not rest while the vision was vouchsafed him. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy</span>. The Church on earth has taken pattern by the Church above; and the "Trisagion" is ever being repeated in one part of the earth or another without ceasing: "Thou continuest holy, O thou Worship of Israel." There is no attribute so essential to God as this. It is for his holiness, more than for anything else, that his creatures worship him. The triple repetition has been understood in all ages of the Church as connected with the doctrine of the Trinity. Holy is he who has created us, and bidden us worship him in the beauty of holiness Holy is he who has redeemed us, and washed away our sins, and made us by profession holy! Holy is he who day by day sanctifies us, and makes us in very deed and truth, so far as we will permit him, holy! <span class="cmt_word">The whole earth is full of his glory</span>. Even in heaven the seraphic thoughts are turned to earth, and its relation to its Divine Creator is made the subject of angelic utterances (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>). The lesson which they gather from their contemplation, even under all the miserable circumstances of the time, is a cheering one: "The whole earth is full of God's glory." Men, whether they will it or not, are working out God's purposes, advancing his designs, accomplishing the ends that he desires (see Homiletics on Isaiah 5:25-29). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The posts of the door moved</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the bases of the thresholds shook</span> (compare Revised Version). The shout of the seraphs shook the very foundations on which the thresholds of the gates of heaven rested - a testimony to the energy with which it was uttered. <span class="cmt_word">At the voice of him that cried</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "at the voice of each and all." <span class="cmt_word">The house was filled with smoke.</span> "Smoke" is sometimes the mere sign of the presence of God, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>; but more often it indicates his presence in anger or judgment (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/15-8.htm">Revelation 15:8</a>). Here there had been no smoke at first, and we must suppose it, therefore, a sign of the anger which finds vent in ver. 9-12. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, Woe <i>is</i> me! for I am undone; because I <i>am</i> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - THE SEQUEL OF THE VISION - THE PROPHET'S SENSE OF UNWORTHINESS. The vision of God in this life, whether natural or ecstatic, cannot but produce in the beholder a deep feeling of his unworthiness. God "is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;" even "the heavens are not clean in his sight" (<a href="../../par/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>). Man, being never wholly purged from sin while on earth, cannot but shrink from contact with the absolutely Holy. Hence Isaiah's cry (ver. 5); and hence, to comfort him, the symbolic action of the seraph (ver. 6) and his encouraging words (ver. 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am undone</span>; literally, <span class="accented">cut off</span>, <span class="accented">destroyed</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5, 6</a>, etc.). God once said himself, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). Men expected to die even when they had seen angels of God (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>). How we are to reconcile <a href="../../par/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a> with this passage, <a href="../../par/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>, and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>, is uncertain. Perhaps the <span class="accented">ecstatic</span> sight was not included in the "<span class="accented">seeing"</span> <span class="accented">of</span> which God spoke to Moses. <span class="cmt_word">I am a man of unclean lips.</span> A man must be indeed" perfect" never to offend in word (<a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). Isaiah felt that he had often so offended. His lips were not "<span class="accented">clean"</span> in God's sight, and if not his lips, then not his heart; for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.</span> Men catch up the phraseology of their time, and use wrong forms of speech, because they hear them daily. "Evil communications corrupt good manners" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, <i>which</i> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A live coal</span>; or, <span class="accented">a glowing stone</span>, as Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne understand (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-6.htm">1 Kings 19:6</a>, where a cognate word is used). <span class="cmt_word">The tongs... the altar</span>. The presence of an altar in the heavenly dwelling, with the usual appurtenances, is assumed (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>). The altar is, no doubt, an altar of incense, and of gold, not of stone; but the incense is burnt upon stones heated to a glow, and it is one of these stones which the angel takes with the golden tongs of the sanctuary (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-7.htm">Isaiah 6:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he laid <i>it</i> upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He laid it upon my mouth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he caused it to touch my mouth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "he touched my mouth with it." He brought it into contact with that part of him which the prophet had recognized (ver. 5) as the seat of impurity. <span class="cmt_word">Thine iniquity is taken away</span>. By the contact the prophet's impurity is purged, and he is freed from it. The symbolical net showed <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that sin could be purged; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the highest angelic nature could not, alone and of its own force, purge it; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the purging could come only from that fire which consumes the incense that is laid upon the altar of God. Dr. Kay suggests that this fire is "the Divine love."

Then said I, Here <i>am</i> I; send me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - THE PROPHET ENTRUSTED WITH A SPECIAL MISSON. We do not know what special call Isaiah had had previously. Perhaps he had been brought up in the "schools of the prophets." Perhaps, when the "word of the Lord" came to him, he had accepted the fact as sufficient call. Now, however, he had, in vision, a clear and distinct call and mission (vers. 8, 9). He was told to "go," and instructed as to what he was to say (vers. 9, 10). As before (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1-5</a>.), while in the main he was to denounce woe, he was still to proclaim the survival of a remnant (vers. 10-12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom shall I send?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>). Such questions enable those who wait in the courts of heaven to show their zeal and readiness. <span class="cmt_word">Who will go for us?</span> Some explain the plural pronoun as used of the Almighty and those with whom he is consulting. But he does not really "consult" his creatures (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-14.htm">Isaiah 40:14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>), nor do his messengers do his errands <span class="accented">for them</span>. The plural form is best explained by the light which ver. 3 throws on it, as indicative of the doctrine of the Trinity (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye indeed... see ye indeed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">hearing hear</span>... <span class="accented">in seeing see -</span> with the force of "Listen and bear; look and see;" "Attend, "that is," with the outward souse, and catch all that sense can catch, but without perception of the inward meaning" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>, etc.).

It would not awaken the people out of their apathy, it would not stir them to repentance; therefore it would only harden and deaden them. The words have a national, not an individual, application. <span class="cmt_word">Shut their eyes</span>; literally, <span class="accented">besmear their eyes</span>; or, <span class="accented">seal them up</span>.

Even when the great mass of these persons went into Egypt and perished there (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11-27</a>), a certain number escaped and returned to Palestine (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the ground</span>, <span class="accented">the soil</span>.
