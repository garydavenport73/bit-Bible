Jehovah called his Servant from the womb; mentioned him by name; made his mouth a sharp sword; held him in his hand; caused him to be a polished weapon; appointed him his Servant; assured him of a right and a recompense; appointed him, not only to restore and recover Israel, but to be a Light to the Gentiles, and to give salvation to the ends of the world (vers. 1-6); chose him (ver. 7); will help him (ver. 8); through him will both deliver the captive everywhere (ver. 9), and cause joy to break out in every part of heaven and earth (vers. 11-13). It is quite impossible that these things can be said of aught but a person, or of any person other than him in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Listen, O isles</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1, 4, 6</a>). Since the beginning of ch. 43. Israel alone has been addressed. Now that the mission of the Servant of Jehovah is to be treated of, all the world must be summoned to hear, for all the world is directly interested. <span class="cmt_word">Ye people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye peoples</span>, or <span class="accented">ye nations. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Lord hath called me from the womb</span>. Isaiah could not have said this of himself, for his "call" took place when he was of mature age. But Christ was designated for his office from the womb (<a href="../../par/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31-33</a>). He was also still "in the womb of his mother" when the name of Jesus was given to him (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>, <a href="../../par/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword</span>. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says that "the Word of God" generally "is... sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Christian experience testifies that tiffs keen, searching, cutting power attaches in an especial way to the sayings of Jesus, which pierce the heart as no other words can do, and rankle in the soul, which is quite unable to forget them. The imagery recurs in the Revelation of St. John (<a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the shadow of his hand hath he hid me</span>. Either keeping him safe from the malice of his enemies, or reserving him until, "in the fulness of time," it would be fitting to reveal him to the world<span class="cmt_word">. And made me a polished shaft</span>, A weapon even keener than a sword, smoothed and polished, so as to make it pierce the deeper, and kept hid in God's quiver until the time came when it could be launched with most effect against the hearts of ungodly men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a></div><div class="verse">And said unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my Servant, O Israel</span>. That the literal "Israel," is not intended appears plainly from ver. 5. The Servant himself is addressed as "Israel," because he "would stand as a new federal head to the nation" (Kay), which would be summed up in him, and also because he would be, in a truer sense than any other, an "Israel," or "Prince with God." In whom <span class="cmt_word">I will be glorified</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31</a>, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and <span class="accented">God is glorified in him"</span>). He who is "the Brightness of the Father's glory" sets forth that glory before men, and causes them to glorify him, both with their tongues and in their lives.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: <i>yet</i> surely my judgment <i>is</i> with the LORD, and my work with my God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I said, I have laboured in vain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and I</span>, <span class="accented">for my part</span>, <span class="accented">had said.</span> The Servant had momentarily desponded, seeing the small results of all his efforts to reclaim Israel, and had felt a natural human regret at so much labour apparently expended in vain; but his despondency had been soon checked by the thought that God would not suffer any "labour of love" to be wholly in vain, but would give it the recompense which it merited. The verse brings strongly out the true humanity of the "Servant," who feels as men naturally feel, but restrains himself, and does not allow his feelings to carry him away. Compare with this despondency the grief exhibited by our Lord on two occasions (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>), and the depression which extorted from him the memorable words, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>). My work; rather, <span class="accented">my reward</span>, or <span class="accented">my recompense.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a></div><div class="verse">And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb <i>to be</i> his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now, saith the Lord</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and now the Lord hath said - he that formed me from the womb to be a Servant to him</span>, <span class="accented">that I might bring back Jacob to him</span>, <span class="accented">and that Israel might be gathered to him</span>; <span class="accented">for I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord</span>, <span class="accented">and my God is become my Strength - he hath said - It is a light thing</span>, etc. The whole of ver. 5, after the words, "and now the Lord hath said," is parenthetic. (On the service which our Lord continually rendered, while on earth, to the Father, see <a href="../../par/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>.) The Revelation of St. John shows that in heaven he is still engaged in carrying out his Father's behests. <span class="cmt_word">Though Israel be not gathered</span>. This reading, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, "entirely spoils the symmetry of the verse." The practice of writing fresh copies of the Scripture <span class="accented">from dictation</span> is answerable for the double reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> both here and in other places. <span class="cmt_word">Yet shall I be glorious</span>. The "Servant" would receive glory even by such a partial conversion of the Jews as took place through his ministry. It is never to be forgotten that all the original twelve apostles were Jews, that Matthias was a Jew, that Paul and Barnabas were Jews, and that the original Church was a Church of Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41-47</a>). All that was truly spiritual in Judaism flowed into the Church of Christ, as into its natural home, and the Jewish element in the Church, if not numerically great, was yet the predominant and formative element. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is a light thing</span>. God rewards his servants <span class="accented">according to</span> their works. He is supremely just. He was not content that even Nebuchadnezzar should be insufficiently rewarded for the service that he rendered against Tyre (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18</a>), and he therefore gave him Egypt in addition as his recompense (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>). It would have been "a light thing" - "too light a thing" (Kay, Cheyne) - to have rewarded the labours of Jesus with the conversion of the Jews only. God therefore gave him as his recompense the gathering in of the Gentiles also, and made him a means of salvation even to the uttermost ends of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">The preserved of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "remnant" that had not perished through previous judgments. <span class="cmt_word">I will also give thee for a Light to the Gentiles</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>, etc.). Greeks <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were brought into contact with our Lord himself shortly before his crucifixion (<a href="../../par/john/12-20.htm">John 12:20</a>). He wrought a miracle for a Syro-Phoenician woman (<a href="../../par/mark/7-25.htm">Mark 7:25-30</a>). His apostles, after a little time, understood that the gospel was for the world at large, and declared that in Christ there was no difference between Jew and Greek, nay! between Jew and barbarian. Christ had died for all - had come to be a Light to all, would have all come into his Church and obtain salvation through union with him. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest be my Salvation</span>. Christ is called "Salvation," as the Bearer of salvation - he through whom alone can any man be saved (<a href="../../par/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). So he is called "Peace" (<a href="../../par/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>), as the Giver of peace.

Plut., 'Republ.,' 7:2, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). It is not the Jews only who exclaim in such a case, "Away with him! away with him!" (<a href="../../par/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>).

According to a tradition  - which, however, cannot be traced back to any very ancient source - the Magi who came to worship our Lord at Bethlehem   were "kings." The prophecy is, however, to be regarded as having its main fulfilment in the coming to Christ of so many kings and princes, since his ascension into heaven (comp ver. 23). <span class="cmt_word">And the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Holy One of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">that hath chosen thee.</span> Kings will rise from their thrones, and prostrate themselves before Messiah, convinced that Jehovah is faithful in the performance of his promises, and has chosen the Son of Mary to be the Redeemer so long announced as about to appear on earth.

It is a narrow exegesis which confines the prophet's forecast to the mere return of the exiles to Palestine, and their re-settlement on their ancestral estates. They shall feed in the ways, etc. The returning "prisoners" are now represented as a flock of sheep (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>), whom the good Shepherd will "lead" and "guide" by ways in which they will find sufficient pasture, which shall not fail them even when they pass over bare "hill-tops" (see <a href="../../par/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).

Throughout his writings they are continually introduced as the grandest of the works of God (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-3.htm">Isaiah 34:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4, 9, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11, 15</a>, etc.). He expects them to be especially ready to sympathize with man. Such a feeling would be natural to one accustomed to the hill-country of Palestine and the lofty heights of Hermon and Lebanon, but could scarcely have been developed in an exile of the time of Cyrus, born and brought up in the dead level of Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">Hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">comforted...  will have mercy.</span> Both verbs designate the same action, which is really future, but in God's counsels is already accomplished. The perfect is thus, once more, that of prophetic certitude. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a></div><div class="verse">But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Zion said</span>. "Zion" is here the "daughter of Zion," or the people of Israel, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>. The meaning is a rare one. The Lord hath forsaken me (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>). It is not surprising that Israel - even faithful Israel - sometimes desponded, or perhaps despaired, during the long and weary time of the Captivity. Even the "Servant of the Lord" knew moments of despondency (see above, ver. 4, with the comment). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a></div><div class="verse">Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Can a woman forget?....  yea,</span> they may forget. In the siege of Samaria by Benhadad, King of Syria, a mother, we are told (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28, 29</a>), boiled her son for food. In the last siege of Jerusalem similar horrors are reported (Joseph., 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:03, 4). Mothers have even been known in England who have forced their tender and innocent daughters to commit deadly sin. <span class="cmt_word">Yet will I</span> <span class="cmt_word">not forget,</span> The love of God surpasses that of either father or mother. "When my father and my mother forsake me," says David, "then the Lord will take me up" (<a href="../../par/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>). "God is love" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>) in his very essence; and his infinite love is deeper, tenderer, truer, than finite love can ever be. Still, that which is nearest to it upon earth is, doubtless, the love of a mother for her children (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-13.htm">Isaiah 66:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of <i>my</i> hands; thy walls <i>are</i> continually before me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands</span>. The prophet has passed here from the living Zion, Isabel, to their material home, Jerusalem. The metaphor which he uses is no doubt drawn from the practice, common both in ancient and in modern days, of burning or puncturing figures and other mementos upon the hand, the arm, or some other part of the body, and then rendering the figures indelible by rubbing in henna, indigo, gunpowder, or some other coloured substance. Pilgrims in the East have almost always such marks put upon them when they have accomplished their pilgrimage. English sailors are fond of them, and few are without some such mark on their breast or limbs. The meaning here is that God has the thought of Zion as constantly present with him as if her image were indelibly marked on the palms of his hands. (On the anthropomorphic representation of God as having "arms" and "hands," see the comment on Isaiah 40:10.) <span class="cmt_word">Thy walls</span>. It is the city, Zion, the emblem of the people, that can alone be "graven" or "portrayed." This city has, of course, walls. God bears them in mind perpetually, since he is about to cause them to be built up (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3, 4</a>.).

The restored Church, receiving adhesions from the nations on all sides, will be like a bride who puts on her ornaments, and is thereby made glorious to look upon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). The entire Church, not any one part, is designated as the "Bride" of Christ in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-29.htm">Ephesians 5:29, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>).

Palestine, after the return from the Captivity, was at no time over-populated; and when the conversion of the Gentiles took place it caused no influx of fresh settlers into the Holy Land. The object of the prophet is simply to mark the vast growth of the Church, which would necessarily spread itself far beyond the limits of Palestine, and would ultimately require the whole earth for its habitation.

Who has made them my children? Who has trained them?" That they are not her natural children she is sure, since she knows that she has been for a long time "bereaved and unfruitful" (Cheyne) - a captive, and a "wanderer" (Kay). It is certain that the Jewish Church did not at first altogether welcome the incoming of the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>, etc.). But the guidance of the Holy Spirit surmounted the difficulty (<a href="../../par/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>).

The new children - the new converts - are to come from the Gentiles; the fresh "sons" and "daughters" will be carried by the nations in their arms, and by the peoples upon their shoulders. It is usual to expound this and parallel passages (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4; 66:20</a>) of the return of the Jews to their own land by favour of the Gentiles, either when the decree of Cyrus went forth, or at some still future period. But perhaps the children intended are <span class="accented">foster-children</span>, actual Gentiles, whom their parents will bring to baptism. In the Assyrian sculptures, mothers are constantly represented as carrying their children <span class="accented">upon their shoulders</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1 p. 480).

Babylon was mighty. By the laws of war she had a rightful claim to her captives. How was she to be induced or compelled to give them up? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a></div><div class="verse">But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The captives of the mighty shall be taken away</span>. The answer to the questions of ver. 24 is that, if Babylon is mighty, God is mightier. God will "take away" the captives, and "save" his "children."

Civil disunion is intended, which will break the power of Babylon, and render her an easy prey to the Persians. The recently discovered inscriptions clearly show that this was the case. Nabonidus had alienated the affections of his subjects by changes in the religion of the country, and during the course of the war with Cyrus, many Babylonian tribes went over to the invaders, and fought against their own countrymen (see the 'Cylinder of Nabonidus;' and comp.
