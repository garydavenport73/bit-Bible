But he had not repudiated Judah; and her children were wrong to suppose themselves altogether cast off (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a>). They had, in fact, by their transgressions, especially their idolatries, wilfully divorced themselves, or at any rate separated themselves, from God; but no sentence had gone forth from him to bar reconciliation and return. <span class="cmt_word">Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have</span> <span class="cmt_word">sold you!</span> Neither has God exercised the right, regarded as inherent in a parent (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-11.htm">2 Kings 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-5.htm">Nehemiah 6:5, 8</a>), of selling his children to a creditor.

The Egyptian plague of darkness (<a href="../../par/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>) is not adequate to the expressions here used. God means to assert his power of leaving all nature in absolute darkness, if he so choose - a power necessarily belonging to him who said, "Let there be light; and there was light" (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I make sackcloth their covering</span> (see <a href="../../par/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, "The sun became black as sackcloth of hair").

The separateness of this passage has been maintained in the opening paragraph. That it is not of himself that the prophet here speaks, appears <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the self-assertion (vers, 4, 5, 9); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the depth of humiliation declared in ver. 6, which is beyond anything recorded of Isaiah. But if he does not speak of himself, he can scarcely speak of any other besides "the Servant," of whom he has already said much (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>), and of whom he has still much more to say (<a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the tongue of disciples</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a trained tongue, a well-taught tongue.

At no time did the Father "leave him alone" (<a href="../../par/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>) or cease to speak to him. "Morning by morning" is not to be narrowed to the bare literal meaning, but to be taken in the sense of "un-interruptedly." <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">hear as the learned</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to hear as disciples hear</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> attentively, submissively, gladly.

Some understand this of the boring of the ear for perpetual service (<a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>); but it is perhaps better to regard it as intended to mark a contrast between the true Servant and the professed servants, or children of Israel. They "did not hear; their ear was <span class="accented">not</span> opened; they were treacherous and rebellious from the womb" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>). His ear was opened to receive God's word perpetually; he was not rebellious, did not turn away back. Even when most tried, his final word was, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (<a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>).

This is a detail not historically recorded by the evangelists; but it may have had a literal fulfilment.

Spitting in the East marked at once contempt and abhorrence. It is a practice which continues to the present day.

By the resurrection God acquitted Christ of the charge of blasphemy on which he had been condemned, and proclaimed him "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who will contend with me? </span>  (compare St. Paul's words in <a href="../../par/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33, 34</a>, "It is God that justifieth.

If he acquits, it is idle for any accuser to stand forth and "contend" or "condemn" (ver. 9). God will help the innocent, whom he has acquitted, and will destroy the accuser by a secret but most sure destruction.
