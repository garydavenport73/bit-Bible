It is often supposed that this plague carried off the last survivors of the generation condemned at Kadesh (see verse 64); but this is opposed to the statement in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14, 15</a>, and is essentially improbable. The victims of the plague would surely be those who had joined themselves to Baal-Peor; and these again would surely be the younger, not the older, men in Israel. It is part of the moral of the story that these offenders deprived themselves, not merely of a few remaining days, but of many years of happy rest which might have been theirs.

A general command to "vex the Midianites" had indeed been given (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17</a>) on the principle of just retribution (cf. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a>), but no attempt seems to have been made to act upon it until a more specific order was issued (<a href="../../par/numbers/31-2.htm">Numbers 31:2</a>). In any case the present mustering has to do with something far more important, viz., with the approaching settlement of the people in its own territory. This is clear from the instructions given in verses 52-56, and from the distribution of the tribes into families. <span class="cmt_word">From twenty years.</span> See on chapter Numbers 1:3.

The plural "sons" is to be explained here not from the fact (which has nothing to do with it) that several grandsons are afterwards mentioned, but from the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> ("and the sons") was the conventional heading of a family list, and was written doom by the transcriber before he noticed that only one name followed.

This distinct statement, which is not modified in the Targums, seems decisive as to the fate of Korah. If indeed it were quite certain from the detailed narrative in chapter 16 that Korah perished with his own company, and not  with the Reubenites, then it might be deemed necessary to force this statement into accordance with that certainty; but it is nowhere stated, or even clearly implied, that he perished by fire, and therefore there is no excuse for doing violence to the obvious meaning of this verse. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up, we are told, at the same time that Korah's company were consumed by fire; that is a clear statement, and cannot be set aside by any supposed necessity for avenging the sacri1egious ambition of Korah by the element of fire. <span class="cmt_word">And they became a sign.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>properly means a banner or ensign, and is unusual in this sense. It exactly corresponds, however, to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and has no doubt the same secondary signification - a something made conspicuous in order to attract attention and enforce a warning (cf. chapter Numbers 16:30, 38).

The sons of Korah are frequently mentioned among the Levites, and Samuel himself would seem to have been of them (see on 1 Chronicles 6:22, 28, 33-38, and titles to <a href="../../par/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42, 88</a>, &c.); it is, however, slightly doubtful whether the Kohathite Korah of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22</a>, the ancestor of Samuel, is the same as the Izharite Korah, the ancestor of Heman, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-38.htm">1 Chronicles 6:38</a>.

In such cases it is no doubt possible that there were children, but that for some reason they failed to hold together, and became attached to other families. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a> the sons of Simeon appear as Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul. In Genesis and Exodus the first appears as Jemuel.

According to the present enumeration there were eight families in Manasseh, one named after his son Machir, one after his grandson Gilead, and the rest after his great-grandsons. The list given in <a href="../../par/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1, 2</a> agrees with this, except that the Machirites and the Gileadites are apparently identified. It appears from the genealogy in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7.htm">1 Chronicles 7</a> that the mother of Machir was a stranger from Aram, the country of Laban. This may perhaps account for the fact that Machir's son received the name of Gilead, for Gilead was the border land between Aram and Canaan; it more probably explains the subsequent allotment of territory in that direction to the Machirites (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40</a>).

It has been proposed to explain this on the ground of their both being pastoral tribes; but if the members of these tribes were more scattered than the rest, it would be just in their case that we should expect to find round numbers. The one fact which these figures establish in a startling way is, that while the nation as a whole remained heady stationary in point of numbers, the various tribes show a most unexpected variation. Manasseh, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, has increased his population 63 per cent. in spite of the fact that there is not one man left of sixty years of age, while Simeon has decreased in the same proportion. There is indeed little difficulty in accounting for diminishing numbers amidst so many hardships, and after so many plagues. The fact that Zimri belonged to the tribe of Simeon, and that this tribe was omitted soon after from the blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>), may easily lead to the conclusion that Simeon was more than any other tribe involved in the sin of Baal-Peor and the punishment which followed. But when we compare, e. <span class="accented">g.</span>, the twin tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, concerning whom nothing distinctive is either stated or hinted, whether bad or good; and when we find that the one has decreased 20 percent and the other increased 63 percent during the same interval, and under the same general circumstances, we cannot even guess at the causes which must have been at work to produce so striking a difference. It is evident that each tribe had its own history apart from the general history of the nation - a history which had the most important results for its own members, but of which we know almost nothing. It is observable, however, that all the tribes under the leadership of Judah increased, whilst all those in the camp of Reuben decreased.

Two other families, the Shimites (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-21.htm">Numbers 3:21</a>) and the Uzzielites (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-23.htm">1 Chronicles 26:23</a>, and cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/6-22.htm">Exodus 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-24.htm">1 Chronicles 24:24, 25</a>), are omitted here, perhaps because the list is imperfect (see, however, the note on verse 62).

If two Amrams, the later of whom lived some 200 years after the earlier, have been confused (as we seem driven to believe), the confusion is consistently maintained through all the extant records (see the note on chapter Numbers 3:28).

It is evident that the males of Levi were not counted by anything less than hundreds, and probable that they were counted by thousands (see note on chapter Numbers 3:29). The smallness of the increase in a tribe which was excepted from the general doom at Kadesh, and which in other ways was so favourably situated, seems to point to some considerable losses. It is possible that portions of the tribe suffered severely for their share in the rebellion of Korah; if so, the families of the Shimites and of the Uzzielites may have been so much reduced as to be merged in the remaining families.
