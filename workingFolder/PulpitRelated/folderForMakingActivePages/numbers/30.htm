It would appear upon the lace of it that we have in <a href="../../par/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, and in this chapter two fragments of Mosaic legislation dealing with the same subject, but, for some reason which it is useless to attempt to discover, widely separated in the inspired record. Nor does there seem to be any valid reason for explaining away the apparently fragmentary and dislocated character of these two sections (see the Introduction). The statement, peculiar to this passage, that these instructions were issued to the "heads of the tribes" itself serves to differentiate it from all the rest of the "statutes" given by Moses, and suggests that this chapter was inserted either by some other hand or from a  different source. There is no reason whatever for supposing that the "heads of the tribes" were more interested in these particular regulations than in many others which concerned the social life of the people (such as that treated of in <a href="../../par/numbers/5-5.htm">Numbers 5:5-31</a>) which were declared in the ordinary way unto "the children of Israel" at large. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a></div><div class="verse">If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man vow a vow.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, a vow, is commonly said to be distinctively a positive vow, a promise to render something unto the Lord. This, however, cannot be strictly maintained, because the Nazarite vow was <span class="accented">neder</span>, and that was essentially a vow of abstinence. To say that the vow of the Nazarite was of a positive character because he had to let his hair grow "unto the Lord" is a mere evasion. It is, however, probable that <span class="accented">neder</span>, when it occurs (as in this passage) in connection with <span class="accented">issar</span>, does take on the narrower signification of a positive vow. <span class="cmt_word">Swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond.</span> Literally, "to bind a bond upon his soul." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, a bond, which occurs only in this chapter, is considered to be a restrictive obligation, a vow of abstinence. It would appear that the <span class="accented">issar</span> was always undertaken upon oath, whereas the <span class="accented">neder</span> (as in the case of the Nazarite) did not of necessity require it. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall not break his word.</span> This was the general principle with respect to vows, and, as here ]aid down, it was in accordance with the universal religious feeling of mankind. Whatever crimes may have claimed the sanction of this sentiment, whatever exceptions and safeguards a clearer revelation and a better knowledge of God may have established, yet the principle remained that whatsoever a man had promised unto the Lord, that he must fulfill. Iphigenia in Aulis, Jephthah's daughter in Gilead, proclaim to what horrid extremities any one religious principle, unchecked by other coordinate principles, may lead; but they also proclaim how deep and true this religious principle must have been which could so over-ride the natural feelings of men not cruel nor depraved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3</a></div><div class="verse">If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind <i>herself</i> by a bond, <i>being</i> in her father's house in her youth;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a woman vow a vow.</span> The fragmentary nature of this section appears from the fact that, after laying down the general principle of the sacredness of vows, it proceeds to qualify it in three special cases only of vows made by women under authority. That vows made by boys were irreversible is exceedingly unlikely; and indeed it is obvious that many cases must have occurred, neither mentioned here nor in <a href="../../par/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, in which the obligation could not stand absolute. <span class="cmt_word">In her father's house in her youth.</span> Case first, of a girl in her father's house, who had no property of her own, and whose personal services were due to her father. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/30-4.htm">Numbers 30:4</a></div><div class="verse">And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.</div><div class="comm">

If the vow had been made before witnesses, no doubt the father's veto must be pronounced before witnesses also. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/30-6.htm">Numbers 30:6</a></div><div class="verse">And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If she had at all a husband.</span> Literally, "if being she be to an husband."

Case second, of a married or betrothed woman. As far as the legal status of the woman was concerned, there was little difference under Jewish law whether she were married or only betrothed. In either case she was accounted as belonging to her husband, with all that she had (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">she vowed.</span> Rather, "and her vows be upon her." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>. The vows might have been made before her betrothal, and not disallowed by her father; yet upon her coming under the power of her husband he had an absolute right to dissolve the obligation of them; otherwise it is evident that he might suffer loss through an act of which he had no notice. <span class="cmt_word">Or</span> <span class="cmt_word">uttered ought out of her lips.</span> Rather, "or the rash utterance of her lips." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which is not found elsewhere (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a>), seems to have this meaning. Such a vow made by a young girl as would be disallowed by her husband when he knew of it would presumably be a "rash utterance."

The husband had naturally the same absolute authority to allow or disallow all such vows as the father had in the case of his unmarried daughter. The only difference is that the responsibility of the husband is expressed in stronger terms than that of the father, because in the nature of things the husband has a closer interest in and control over the proceedings of his wife than the father has over those of the daughter.
