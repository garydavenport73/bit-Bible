It is also used in the sense of "tribe" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4, 16</a>). Each tribe was but a branch, or rod, out of the stock of Israel, and, therefore, was most naturally represented by the rod cut from the tree. 'The words used for scepter in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, and in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, and for rod in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, and elsewhere are different, but the same imagery underlies the use of all of them. <span class="cmt_word">Of all</span> <span class="cmt_word">their princes...  twelve rods.</span> These princes must be those named in chapter 2 and 7. Since among these are to be found the tribe princes of Ephraim and Manasseh, standing upon a perfect equality with the rest, it is evident that the twelve rods were exclusive of that of Aaron. The joining together of Ephraim and Manasseh in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> was a very different thing, because it could not raise any question as between the two.

This rod was, therefore, provided by Moses himself, and inscribed by him with the name of Aaron, who stood by Divine appointment (so recently and fearfully attested) above all his brethren. For the significance of the act cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16-28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For one rod... for the head of the house of their fathers.</span> For Levi, therefore, there must be, not three rods inscribed with the names of the chiefs, but one only bearing the name of Aaron, as their common superior.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/17-7.htm">Numbers 17:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the Lord,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in front of the ark. <span class="cmt_word">In the tabernacle of witness.</span> "In the tent of the testimony." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was budded:</span> or "sprouted." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And yielded almonds.</span> Rather, "matured almonds." This particular rod had been cut from an almond tree, and it would seem probable that it had on it shoots and flowers and fruit at once, so that the various stages of its natural growth were all exemplified together. The almond has its Hebrew name <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, "awake," from the well-known fact of its being the first of all trees to awake from the winter sleep of nature, and to herald the vernal resurrection with its conspicuous show of snow-white blossoms, which even anticipate the leaves (cf. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>). Thus the "rod of an almond-tree" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>) was shown to the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>) as the evident symbol of the vigilant haste with which the purposes of God were to be developed and matured. It is possible that all the tribe princes had official "rods" of the almond-tree to denote their watchful alacrity in duty, and that these were the rods which they brought to Moses. In any case the flowering and fruiting of Aaron's rod, while it was an unquestionable miracle (for if not a miracle, it could only have been a disgraceful imposture), was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in the true sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a miracle which was also a parable. Aaron's rod could no more blossom and fruit by nature than any of the others, since it also had been severed from the living tree; and so in Aaron himself was no more power or goodness than in the rest of Israel. But as the rod germinated and matured its fruit by the power of God, supernaturally starting and accelerating the natural forces of vegetable life, even so in Aaron the grace of God was quick and fruitful to put forth, not the signs only and promise of spiritual gifts and energies, but the ripened fruits as well. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/17-9.htm">Numbers 17:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And took every man his rod.</span> So that they saw for themselves that their rods remained dry and barren as they were by nature, while Aaron's had been made to live. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the testimony.</span> By comparison with verse 7 this should mean before the ark in which the "testimony" lay. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, however, the rod is said to have been in the ark, although before Solo-men's time it had disappeared (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>). We may suppose that after it had been inspected by the princes it was deposited for safer preservation and easier conveyance inside the sacred chest. <span class="cmt_word">To be kept for a</span> <span class="cmt_word">token against the rebels.</span> Rather, "against the rebellious," literally, "children of rebellion" (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 3</a>). It could only serve as a token as long as it retained the evidences of having sprouted and fruited, either miraculously in a fresh state, or naturally in a withered state. As a fact, however, it does not appear that the lesson ever needed to be learnt again, and therefore we may suppose that the rod was left first to shrivel with age, and then to be lost through some accident.

These are the last wailings of the great storm which had raged against Moses and Aaron, which had roared so loudly and angrily at its height, which was now sobbing itself out in the petulant despair of defeated and disheartened men, cowed indeed, but not convinced, fearful to offend, yet not loving to obey.
