There is, however, no direct reference to those events, and it is quite possible that the only connection was one of subject-matter in the mind of the writer. That the regulations which follow were addressed to Aaron directly is a thing unusual, and indeed unexampled. The ever-recurring statement elsewhere is, "the Lord spake unto Moses," varied occasionally by "the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron" (as in <a href="../../par/numbers/2-1.htm">Numbers 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>); but  even where the communication refers to things wholly and peculiarly within the province of Aaron, it is usually made to Moses, and only through him to his brother (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1-3</a>). This change in the form of the message may point to a later date, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to a time subsequent to the gainsaying of Korah, when the separate position of Aaron as the head of a priestly caste was more fully recognized than before, and he himself somewhat less under the shadow of his greater brother. <span class="cmt_word">Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the sanctuary.</span> Aaron's father's house, according to the analogy of <a href="../../par/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2, 3, 6</a>, was the sub-tribe of the Kohathites, and these had charge (to the exclusion of the other Levites) of the sanctuary, or rather sacred things (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). See on Numbers 4:15. This mention of the Kohathites in connection with the sanctuary is an incidental proof that these instructions were given in view of the wanderings in the wilderness, for after the settlement in Canaan no Levites (as such) came into contact with the sacred furniture. It is not easy to define exactly the meaning of "shall bear the iniquity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of the sanctuary." The general sense of the phrase is, "to be responsible for the iniquity," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, for anything which caused displeasure in the eyes of God, "in connection with the sacred things and the service of them;" hence it meant either to be responsible for such iniquity, as being held accountable for it, and having to endure the penalty, or as being permitted and enabled to take such accountability on oneself, and so discharge it from others. This double sense is exactly reflected in the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as applied to our Lord (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The priests, therefore (and the Kohathites, so far as they had anything to do with the sanctuary), were responsible for all the unholiness attaching or accruing to it, not only by reason of all offences committed by themselves, but by reason of that imperfection which clung to them at the best, and made them unworthy to handle the things of God. In a further and deeper sense they might be said to be vicariously responsible for all the iniquity of all Israel, so far as the taint of it affected the very sanctuary (see on Exodus 28:38; Leviticus 16:16). <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of your priesthood.</span> The responsibility not only for all sinful acts of omission and commission in Divine service (such as those of Nadab and Abihu, and of Korah), but for all the inevitable failure of personal holiness on the part of those who ministered unto the Lord. This responsibility was emphatically recognized and provided for in the rites of the great day of atonement.

The altar (of burnt offering) and "that within the vail (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>) were the two points between which the exclusive duties of the priesthood lay, including the service of the holy place. <span class="cmt_word">A service of gift.</span> A service which was not to be regarded as a burden, or a misfortune, or as a natural heritage and accident of birth, but to be received and cherished as a favour accorded to them by the goodness of God.

The word <span class="accented">terumoth</span> must here be understood in its widest sense, as including everything which the Israelites dedicated or "lifted" of all their possessions, so far as these were not destroyed in the act of offering. <span class="cmt_word">Of all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the hallowed things.</span> The genitive of identity: "consisting of all the hallowed things."

This expression is somewhat perplexing, because it stands commonly for the holy of holies (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>).

There is no reason why this court should not be called "must holy," as well as "holy;" if it was "holy" with respect to the camp, or the holy city, it was "most holy" with respect to all without the camp, or without the gate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the expression does not mean "in the most holy place," but "amongst the most holy things," as it does in <a href="../../par/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, and above in verse 9. A distinction is clearly intended between the "most holy things," which only the priests and their sons might eat, and the "holy things," of which the rest of their families might partake also. It is difficult to decide between these renderings, although there can be no doubt that the "most holy" things were actually to be consumed within the tabernacle precincts.

It would seem that the priest was to make the valuation for the people, since each first-born or firstling was separately claimed by God, and had to be separately redeemed; but at the same time, to prevent extortion, the sum which the priest might assess was fixed by God. <span class="cmt_word">For the money of five shekels.</span> About seventeen shillings of our money (see <a href="../../par/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>). It is extremely drill cult to estimate the number of first-born, but it is evident that in any case a large income must have accrued to the priests in this way. No value is here set upon the firstlings of unclean beasts; in the most usual ease, that of the ass, the rule had been laid down in <a href="../../par/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>; and in other cases it was apparently left to the discretion of the priests, subject to the right of the owner, if he saw fit, to destroy the animal rather than pay for it (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-27.htm">Leviticus 27:27</a>).

This is not to be explained away, as if it meant only that they were to live "of the altar." Just as the priests (and in a lesser sense all the Levites) were the special possession of the Lord, so the Lord was the special possession of the priests; and inasmuch as all the whole earth belonged to him, the portion of the priests was, potentially in all cases, actually for those who were capable of realizing it, infinitely more desirable than any other portion. The spiritual meaning of the promise was so clearly felt that it was constantly claimed by the devout in Israel, irrespective of their ecclesiastical status (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-24.htm">Lamentations 3:24</a>, &c.).

It is probable indeed that the giving of tithes had been more or less a matter of obligation from time immemorial. Abraham had paid them on one memorable occasion (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>), and Jacob had vowed them on another (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>). From this time forth, however, the tithes were formally assigned to the maintenance of the Levites, in return for their service.

At this time the other Israelites were nearly fifty times as numerous as the Levites, and therefore they would have been exceptionally well provided for. It must be remembered, however, that the Levites would naturally increase faster than the rest, not being exposed to the same dangers; and still more that tithes are never paid at all fully or generally, even when of strict legal obligation. A glance along the history of Israel after the conquest will satisfy us that at no time could the people at large be trusted to pay their tithes, unless it were during the ascendancy of the Maccabees, and afterwards under the influence of the Pharisees (cf. <a href="../../par/malachi/3-9.htm">Malachi 3:9, 10</a>). The Levites, indeed, appear in the history of Israel as the reverse of an opulent or influential class. It was no doubt much easier for the sons of Aaron to obtain their tithes from the Levites; and as these were very numerous in proportion, and the tithes themselves were only a part of their revenues, the priests should have been, and in later times certainly were, sufficiently rich. If they were devout they no doubt spent much on the service of the altar and of the sanctuary.
