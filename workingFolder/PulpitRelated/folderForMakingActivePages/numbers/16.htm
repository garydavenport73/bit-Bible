The word "took" stands alone at the head of the sentence in the singular number. This does not by itself confine its reference to Korah, because it may be taken as repeated after each of the other names; at the same time, the construction suggests that in its original form Korah alone was mentioned, and that the other names were afterwards added in order to include them in the same statement. The ellipsis after "took" (if it be one) may be filled up by "men," as in the A.V. and in most versions, or by "counsel," as in the Jerusalem Targum. The Septuagint has in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, representing apparently a different reading. Some commentators regard it as an anacoluthon for "took two hundred and fifty men...  and rose up with them;" others, again, treat the "took" as a pleonasm, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a> and elsewhere; but the change of number from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> makes it difficult. It seems best to say that the construction is broken and cannot be satisfactorily explained. Indeed there can be no question that the whole narrative, like the construction of the opening verses, is rely confused, and leaves on the mind the impression that it has been altered, not very skillfully, from its original form. The two parts of the tragedy, that concerning the company of Korah, and that concerning the Reubenites, although mingled in the narrative, do not adjust themselves in the mind, and the general effect is obscure. It is sufficient to point out here that no one can certainly tell what became of the ringleader himself, who was obviously the head and front of the whole business. Some are strenuously of opinion that he was swallowed up alive, others as strenuously that he was consumed with fire; but the simple fact is that his death is not recorded in this chapter at all, although he is assumed to have perished. The obscurity which hangs over this passage cannot be traced to any certain cause; the discrepancies and contradictions which have been discovered in it are clue to mistake or misrepresentation; nor can any evil motive be plausibly assigned for the interpolation (if it be such) of that part of the story which concerns the Reubenites. If, for some reason unknown to us, an original narrative of Korah's rebellion was enlarged so as to include the simultaneous mutiny of the Reubenites  and their fate; and if, further, that enlargement was so unskillfully made as to leave considerable confusion in the narrative, wherein does that affect either its truth or its inspiration? The supernatural influence which watched over the production of the sacred narrative certainly did not interfere with any of those natural causes which affected its composition, its style, its clearness or obscurity. <span class="cmt_word">Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi.</span> On the genealogy of the Levites see Exodus 6:16-22, and above on Numbers 3:17-19. It is generally supposed that some generations are passed over in these genealogies. Korah belonged to the same Kohathite sub-tribe as Moses and Aaron, and was related to them by some sort of cousinship; his father (or ancestor) Izhar was the younger brother of Amram and the elder brother of Uzziel, whose descendant Elizaphan had been made chief of the Kohathites. <span class="cmt_word">Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab.</span> Eliab himself was apparently the only son of Pallu, the second son of Reuben (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5, 8</a>). If the word "son" is to be literally understood in all these cases, then Korah, Dathan, and Abiram would all be great-great-grandsons of Jacob himself. <span class="cmt_word">On, the son of Peleth.</span> It is one of the strange obscurities of this narrative that On, who appears here as a ringleader, is never mentioned again either in this chapter or elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Sons of Reuben.</span> Reubenites. The encampment of their tribe was on the south side of the tabernacle in the outer line (<a href="../../par/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>), while that of the Kohathites was on the same side in the inner line. Thus they were to some extent neighbours; but see below on verse 24. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they rose up before Moses.</span> It is suggested that the Reubenites were aggrieved because their father had been deprived of his birthright in favour of Judah, and that Korah was aggrieved because the Uzzielites had been preferred in the person of Elizaphan to the Izharites (chapter 3:30). These accusations have nothing whatever in the narrative to support them, and are suspicious because they are so easy and so sure to be made in such cases. In all <span class="accented">ecclesiastical</span> history the true reformer, as well as the heretic and the demagogue, has always been charged with being actuated by motives of disappointed ambition. Without these gratuitous suppositions there was quite enough to excite the anger and opposition of such discontented and insubordinate minds as are to be found in every community. <span class="cmt_word">With</span> <span class="cmt_word">certain of the children of Israel.</span> These were gathered front the tribes at large, as implied in the statement that Zelophehad a Manassite was not amongst them (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Famous in the congregation.</span> Literally, "called men of the congregation."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, <i>Ye take</i> too much upon you, seeing all the congregation <i>are</i> holy, every one of them, and the LORD <i>is</i> among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</span> They had risen up before Moses, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, made a tumult in his presence, because they regarded him (and rightly) as the actual ruler of Israel <span class="cmt_word">in</span> religious as well as in secular matters. At the same time, the attack of Korah and his company (with whom alone the narrative is really concerned here) was directed especially against the ecclesiastical rule which Moses exercised through his brother Aaron. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">take too much upon you.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "much for you," probably in the sense of "enough for you" (cf. the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/45-28.htm">Genesis 45:28</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, you have enjoyed power long enough; so the Targum Palestine. It may, however, be taken with the following <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as meaning, "let it suffice you that all the congregation," &c.; and so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> The Targum of Onkelos renders it in the same sense as the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation are holy, every one of them.</span> This was perfectly true, m a sense. There was a sanctity which pertained to Israel as a nation, in which all its members shared as distinguished from the nations around (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>); there was a priesthood which was inherent in all the sons of Israel, older and more indelible than that which was conferred on Aaron's line - a priesthood which, apart from special restrictions, or in exceptional circumstances, might and did assert itself in priestly acts (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and compare the cases of Samuel, Elijah, and others who offered sacrifice during the failure of the appointed priesthood). It Moses had taken the power to himself, or it he had (as they doubtless supposed) restricted active priestly functions to Aaron because he was his brother, and wholly under his influence, their contention would have been quite right. They erred, as most violent men do, not because they asserted what was false, but because they took for granted that the truth which they asserted was really inconsistent with the claims which they assailed. The congregation were all holy; the sons of Israel were all priests; that was true - but it was also true that by Divine command Israel could only exercise his corporate priesthood outwardly through the one family which God had set apart for that purpose. The same God who has lodged in the body certain faculties and powers for the benefit of the body, has decreed that those faculties and powers can only be exercised through certain determinate organs, the very specialization of which is both condition and result of a high organization. <span class="cmt_word">The congregation of the Lord.</span> There are two words for congregation in this verse: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> here, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> before. The former seems to be used in the more solemn sense, but they are for the most part indistinguishable, and certainly cannot be assigned to different authors. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/16-4.htm">Numbers 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">And when Moses heard <i>it</i>, he fell upon his face:</div><div class="comm">

It may well be that his position as a prominent Levite and a relation of Moses gave him great influence with men of other tribes, and earned him a great name for disinterestedness and liberality in advocating the rights of all Israel, and in denouncing the exclusive claims and privileges by which he himself (as a Levite) was benefited. It is often assumed that Korah was secretly aiming at the high-priesthood, but of this, again, there is not a shadow of proof; his error was great enough, and his punishment sore enough, without casting upon him these unfounded accusations. It would be more in accordance with human nature if we supposed that Korah was in his way sincere; that he had really convinced himself, by dint of trying to convince others, that Moses and Aaron were usurpers; that he began his agitation without thought of advantage of himself; that, having gained a considerable following and much popular applause, the pride of leadership and the excitement of conflict led him on to the last extremity. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> will <span class="cmt_word">show who are his.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, the meaning of which is defined by the following words, "whom he hath chosen." Moses refers the matter to the direct decision of the Lord; as that decision had originated the separate position of Aaron, that should also vindicate it.

From the number required, they must have been either household utensils used for carrying fire, or else they must have been made in some simple fashion for the occasion. The offering of incense was proposed by Moses as a test because it was a typically priestly function, to which the gravest importance was attached (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12, 13</a>), and because it was so very simply executed.

The <span class="cmt_word">exact</span> meaning of this <span class="accented">tu</span> <span class="accented">quoque</span> is not apparent.

It is possible enough that behind him was a considerable body of public opinion among the Levites more or less decidedly supporting him; but there is no need to impute any general disloyalty to them.

His "company" apparently included representative men from all the tribes, or at least from many (see on verse 2). They were seeking the priesthood because they affirmed it to be the common possession of all Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Against the Lord.</span> It was in his name that they appeared, and to some extent no doubt sincerely; but since they appeared to dispute an ordinance actually and historically made by God himself, it was indeed against him that they were gathered. <span class="cmt_word">And what is</span> <span class="cmt_word">Aaron,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that ye murmur against him?</span> The construction is broken, as so often when we have the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of Moses, whose meekness did not enable him to speak calmly under provocation. The sentence runs, "For which cause thou and all thy company who arc gathered against the Lord, - and Aaron, who is he, that ye murmur against him?" It was easy to represent the position of Aaron in an invidious light, as though they were assailing some personal sacerdotal pretensions; but in truth he was only a poor servant of God doing what he was bid.

In this case, however, the event was predicted, and wholly supernatural. The sequence of the narrative would lead us to suppose that the earth opened beneath the tents of Dathan and Abiram in the camp of Reuben. It is difficult to think of the gulf as extending so far as to involve the tent of Korah in the Kohathite lines in the same destruction, while there is nothing to suggest the idea that the earth opened in more than one place. It is true that the camps of the Reubenites and of the Kohathites were more or less contiguous; but when it is remembered that there were 46,500 adult males in the former, and 8600 males in the latter, and that a broad space must have been left between the two lines of encampment, it is obviously improbable that Korah's tent was in a practical sense "near" to those of Dathan and Abiram, unless indeed he had purposely removed it in order to be under the protection of his Reubenite partisans. It is very observable that not a word is said here as to the fate of Korah himself. It is implied in verse 40 that he had perished, and it is apparently asserted in <a href="../../par/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a> that he was swallowed up with Dathan and Abiram (see the note there). On the other hand, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-17.htm">Psalm 106:17</a> speak of the engulfing of the other two without any mention of Korah himself sharing their fate; and while "all the men that appertained unto Korah" perished, his own sons did not (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-11.htm">Numbers 26:11</a>). On these grounds it is held by most commentators that Korah died by fire among those who offered incense (verse 35). This, however, is untenable, because "the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense" are distinctly mentioned as having been his partisans (verse 2), and are always counted exclusive of Korah himself. On the whole, while it is certain that the narrative is very obscure, and the question very doubtful, it seems most agreeable to all the testimonies of Holy Scripture to conclude - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Korah had left his own place, and had some sort of dwelling (mischan) either in common with Dathan and Abiram, or hard by their tents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the earth opened and swallowed up the <span class="accented">mishcan</span>, of Korah, and the tents of Dathan and Abiram. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That Korah's men (see next verse) and their property were swallowed up with his <span class="accented">mishcan</span>, and (as far as we can tell) Korah himself also.
