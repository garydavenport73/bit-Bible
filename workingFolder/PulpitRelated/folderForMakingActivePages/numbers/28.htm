It is obvious that the formula with which the section opens might be used with equal propriety to introduce a digest of the law on this subject compiled by Moses himself, or by some subsequent editor of his writings from a number of scattered regulations, written or oral, which had Divine authority. It is indeed quite true that this routine of sacrifice was only suitable for times of settled habitation in the promised land, and therefore there is a certain propriety in its introduction here on the eve of the entry into Canaan. But it must be remembered, on the other hand, that the same thing holds true of very much of the legislation given at Mount Sinai, and avowedly of that comprised in chapter 15 (see verse 2), which yet appears from its position to have been given before the rebellion of Korah in the wilderness. It is indeed plain that the ritual, festal, and sacrificial system, both as elaborated in Leviticus and as supplemented in Numbers, presupposed throughout an almost immediate settlement in Canaan. It is also plain that a system so elaborate, and entailing so much care and expense, could hardly have come into regular use during the conquest, or for some time after. It cannot, therefore, be said with any special force that the present section finds its natural place here. All we can affirm is that the system itself was of Divine origin, and dated in substance from the days of Moses. In any case, therefore, it is rightly introduced with the usual formula which attests that it came from God, and came through Moses. It must be noted that a great variety of observances which were zealously followed by the Jews of later ages find no place here. Compare, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the ceremonial pouring of water during the feast of tabernacles, to which allusion is made by the prophet Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>) and our Lord (<a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37, 38</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a></div><div class="verse">Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, <i>and</i> my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, <i>for</i> a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My offering, and my bread.</span> Literally, "my korban, my bread."

"Bread" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) is translated "food" in <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11, 16</a> (see the note there). <span class="cmt_word">Sweet savour.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>.

Whatever else was offered was in addition to it, not in lieu of it. The sabbath and festival use of the Jews was developed out of the ferial use, and rested upon it. Hence in a connected republication of the law of offering it could not be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Without spot.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>.

This necessary qualification had not been expressed in the original ordinance, but in respect of other sacrifices had been continually required (see on Exodus 12:5; Leviticus 1:3; chapter Numbers 19:2; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).

The former would seem to be the real meaning of the original. There is nowhere any specific direction as to the ritual of the drink offering (see on Leviticus 23, and <a href="../../par/numbers/15-7.htm">Numbers 15:7, 10</a>), nor is it certain whether it was poured at the foot of the altar (as apparently stated in Ecclus. 1. 15) or poured upon the flesh of the sacrifice on the altar (as seems to be implied in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The strong wine.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The Targums render it "old wine," because the drink offering was in every other instance ordered to be made with wine (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, &c.). <span class="accented">Shecar</span>, however, was not wine, but strong drink other than wine (such as we call "spirits"), and it is invariably used in that sense in contradistinction to wine (see on Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3, &c.). It can only be supposed that the difficulty of procuring wine in the wilderness had caused the coarser and commoner liquor to be substituted for it. It is certainly remarkable that the mention of <span class="accented">shecar</span> should be retained at a time when wine must have been easily obtainable, and was about to become abundant (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>). As it would seem impossible that <span class="accented">shecar</span> should have been substituted for wine after the settlement in Canaan, its mention here may be accepted as evidence of the wilderness-origin of this particular ordinance. The quantity ordained (about a quart for each lamb) was very considerable.

There can be no doubt that this (unlike the sabbath) was a nature-festival, observed more or less by all nations. As such it did not require to be instituted, but only to be regulated and sanctified in order that it might not lend itself to idolatry, as it did among the heathen (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>). The new-moon feast, depending upon no calendar but that of the sky, and more clearly marked in that than any other recurring period, was certain to fix itself deeply in the social and religious habits of a simple pastoral or agricultural people. Accordingly we find it incidentally mentioned as a day of social gathering (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-5.htm">1 Samuel 20:5</a>), and as a day for religious instruction (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>). From the latter passage, and from such passages as <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>, it is evident that the feast of the new moon became to the month exactly what the sabbath was to the week - a day of rest and of worship (see also Judith 8:6).

See on Numbers 7:16. This was probably offered first in order, according to the usual analogy of such sacrifices (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-10.htm">Exodus 29:10-14</a>). There is no authority for supposing that this sin offering superseded the one mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a> <span class="accented">sq. This</span> was essentially part of the customary routine of sacrifice; that was essentially occasional, and proper to some unforeseen contingency.

Even when it is not expressly stated, the presumption is that all the sacrifices here treated of were cumulative.

It is not the same as that prescribed for the same day in <a href="../../par/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, and it is difficult to determine whether it was meant to supersede the previous ordinance, or to be distinct and additional. The fact that no notice is taken of the sacrifice already ordered would seem to point to the former conclusion; but the further fact that no mention is made of the offering of wave-loaves, with which the sacrifices in Leviticus were distinctively connected, seems to show that the two lists were independent (cf. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:10, 6). The fact seems to be that throughout this section no sacrifices are mentioned save such as formed a part of the system which is here for the first time elaborated.
