Strictly speaking it should mean the first day of the first month of the second year (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>); and so the Targum of Palestine, "It was on the day which begins the month Nisan." It is, however, quite clear from the narrative itself, as well as from its position, that the offerings were not actually made until after the taking of the census and the distribution of their respective duties to the Levitical families, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, until the eve of the departure from Sinai. Moreover, since the same phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, occurs in verse 10, it is certain that it cannot apply to the actual presentation of the offerings, which was spread over twelve days (verse 11). The majority, therefore, of the commentators would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> here as in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>, "at the time." It is, however, impossible to admit that there is any similarity whatever between the two passages. In <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> the context itself, as well as the subject matter, oblige us to understand the phrase in the looser sense; but in a plain historical account such as the present the obligation is all the other way. Either the date here given is a mistake (which, on any supposition, is most improbable), or it must be referred to the intention and inception of the princely offerings, the actual presentation being made at the time indicated in the narrative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in the first half of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">had anointed</span> it. From <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>, as compared with <a href="../../par/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>, it would rather appear that Moses did not anoint the tabernacle on the day it was set up, but on some subsequent day. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that the tabernacle and the holy things were anointed through seven successive days: the statement in <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33-35</a> refers only to the consecration of the priests. Since the anointing of the tabernacle was connected with the setting of it up, as the last act of one ceremonial, and was only unavoidably postponed, there is nothing remarkable in the two things being spoken of as if they had taken place on one and the same day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/7-2.htm">Numbers 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who <i>were</i> the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes of Israel.</span> These arc the same men, and are called by the same titles, as those Divinely nominated in <a href="../../par/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> No doubt they were the heads of the nations according to some established rules of precedence before the exodus. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">were over them that were numbered.</span> Hebrew, "stood over."

Emis. understands it as meaning "two-wheeled vehicles." It is a matter of little importance, but the nature of the country itself and the small number of oxen to each carriage point to the probability that they had no wheels, and were carried by the oxen, one in front, and one behind, by means of shafts, as is still the case in parts of India.

He may very well have doubted whether God would sanction their use, as it had not been commanded; and it may be that some delay, perhaps of several days, occurred before he was able to accept them and to assign them to their future uses. In this, or some similar way, must be explained the apparent discrepancy of time.

But it could still be "dedicated" in another sense by the sacrificial gifts, freely offered for the purpose, of the people. No rules appear to have been made as to dedications, but there is an allusion in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a> to the dedication of houses, which may have been accompanied with religions rites, and we know that as a fact the temple was dedicated by Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5</a>), and re-dedicated by the Maccabees (1 Macc. 4:54, <span class="accented">sq.</span>), and the wall of Jerusalem was dedicated by Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a>, sq.).

It may be that the twelve princes all came for the purpose of making their offerings on that day, the day they would naturally choose for the purpose; but on account of the great number of other sacrifices, and the fewness of the priests, <span class="accented">their</span> offerings were postponed by the Divine command, and were actually received later. Thus in will and in meaning the offerings were made "on the day" of the consecration, but were publicly and solemnly received at some subsequent time.

Hebrew, <span class="accented">ohel moed</span>, where God had promised to <span class="accented">meet</span> with him (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To speak with him,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with God, as implied in the word "meeting." <span class="cmt_word">He heard the voice of one speaking unto him.</span> Rather, "he heard the voice conversing with him," making itself audible to him. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, part. Hithpael, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Here is a distinct statement of the supernatural fact that God spake to Moses with an audible human voice, and (no doubt) in the Hebrew language, from out the empty darkness behind the veil. In the fact, indeed, of God so speaking audibly there was nothing new (see <a href="../../par/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, &c.), nor in the fact of his so speaking to Moses (see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and Exodus 33:9); but this records the fulfillment of that promise which was part of God's covenant with Israel, that he would at all times converse with Moses as their mediator from above the mercy-seat (see on Exodus 25:20-22, and cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he spake unto him,</span> i.e., God spake unto Moses: the voice made itself audible, and by the voice God himself spake unto him. It is quite obvious that this statement more properly belongs to an earlier period, viz., to that immediately succeeding the consecration of the tabernacle. On the day it was set up Moses was not able to enter it (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>), but no doubt he did so very soon afterwards, and received from the mouth of the Lord, speaking in the holiest, all the commandments and ordinances recorded in Leviticus and in the beginning of this book. Perhaps the first communication made to him in this way concerned the offerings of the princes when first brought near (verses 4, 11), and for that reason the statement may have been appended to the record of those offerings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
