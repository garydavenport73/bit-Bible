Simeon, however, was at this time enfeebled and disgraced, and was not likely to assert himself in any way. The "great multitude of cattle" belonging to the two tribes probably point to pastoral habits of long standing, since the cattle of the Amorites and Midianites would be equally divided among all. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Jazer.</span> Jazer, or Jaazer, probably stood near the northern source of the Wady Hesban, which enters the Jordan not far from its mouth. The "land of Jazer" would seem to mean the Mishor, or plateau, of Heshbon, over which the Israelites had passed on their way to the plains of Moab (see on Deuteronomy 3:10, "all the cities of the Mishor"). <span class="cmt_word">The land of Gilead.</span> Gilead as the name of a district only previously occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>. It is used with a considerable latitude of meaning in this and the following books. In its widest sense it stands for the whole territory to the east of Jordan (see on verses 26, 29), including even the rugged, volcanic districts of Bashan (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>); but more properly it denoted the  lands on both sides the Jabbok, from the Wady Hesban on the south, to the Yermuk and lake of Tiberias on the north, now known as the provinces of Belka and Jebel Ajlun. These lands are by no means uniformly flat, as the name "Mount Gilead" testifies, but include mountains and hills covered with fine open forests of oak (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-8.htm">2 Samuel 18:8, 9</a>) as well as rolling downs and treeless plains. The soil is almost everywhere of great fertility, and the water supply, although very scanty in summer, is sufficient if carefully husbanded. Even now these provinces produce great store of grain, and are depastured by vast flocks of sheep. In Roman times, as the innumerable ruins testify, they were filled with a large and opulent population. Indeed there could be no comparison in point of agricultural and pastoral value between these open and fertile lands and the broken, stony country of Southern Palestine. If they ever enjoy again the blessing of a strong government and continuous peace they will again justify the choice of Reuben and Gad. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">place for cattle.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used here in the broader sense of district (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>), and is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> in verse 4. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-2.htm">Numbers 32:2</a></div><div class="verse">The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</div><div class="comm">

They all lie to the south of Gilead, properly so called, within a comparatively short distance of the route by which the main body of the Israelites had advanced. Probably the cattle which followed the host were still grazing under guard around these places, and it was very natural that tribes which had hitherto lived closely crowded together should not at first contemplate spreading themselves very far afield. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-4.htm">Numbers 32:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Even</i> the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, <i>is</i> a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:</div><div class="comm">

If they thought at all of the effect of their request upon their brethren, it is quite likely that they intended to do them a kindness by leaving them more room on the other side Jordan; and indeed Canaan proper was all too strait for such a population. Whether they were <span class="accented">wise</span> in wishing to stay in the wider and more attractive lands which they had seen is another matter. They knew that the God of Israel had designed to plant his people between Jordan and the sea, and they certainly risked a partial severance from his promises and his protection by remaining where they did. The subsequent history of the trans-Jordanic tribes is a melancholy commentary on the real unwisdom of their choice. Yet it would have been difficult for them to know that they were wrong, except by an instinct of faith which no Israelites perhaps at that time possessed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-6.htm">Numbers 32:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here.</span> Moses had good cause to feel great anxiety about the entry into Canaan proper. Once already the faith and courage of the people had failed them on the very threshold of the promised land, and a slight discouragement might bring about a similar calamity. Hence he spoke with a degree of sharpness which does not appear to have been deserved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-7.htm">Numbers 32:7</a></div><div class="verse">And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Discourage.</span> The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, translated "discourage" here and in verse 9, is of somewhat doubtful meaning. The Septuagint renders it by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span>, and perhaps the sense is, "Why do ye draw away the heart?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, render it averse from going over.

At the same time it is obviously the more natural, and the more in accordance with facts, because there was not a man left of all those who had rebelled at Kadesh. At Kadesh-Barnea. This mode of writing the name forms a link between the closing chapters of Numbers (here and in <a href="../../par/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>) and the two following books. In Deuteronomy it occurs four times, and "Kadesh" twice. In Joshua "Kadesh-Barnea" occurs exclusively. In the later books "Kadesh" only is used, as in Genesis and in the previous chapters of Numbers. The meaning of the combination is uncertain, and the etymology of "Barnea" altogether obscure. It may be an old name attaching to the place before it became known as a sanctuary. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> in one place, as though it were the name of a man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-9.htm">Numbers 32:9</a></div><div class="verse">For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">they went up,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, no doubt the spies, although the word is not expressed. Moses, indeed, in the heat of his displeasure, seemed to charge their "fathers" generally with the wickedness of ten men.

They do not seem to have received any Divine intimation that their lot was to be on the east of Jordan, but rather to have been guided by their own preference. If so, they cannot be acquitted of a certain presumptuous willfulness in action, and of a certain want of honesty in speech. The phrase here rendered "on this side Jordan" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d6;</span>) cannot be distinguished grammatically from that which bears an opposite signification in the preceding verse. In itself it is perfectly ambiguous without some qualifying word or phrase, and it is very difficult to know what the ordinary use of it was in the time of Moses. In later ages, no doubt, it came to mean simply the trans-Jordanic territory, or Peraea, without reference to the position of the speaker. The difficulty here is to decide whether the expression, as further defined by "eastward," would actually have been used at that time and in that place, or whether the expression is due to a writer living on the west of Jordan. All we can say is, that the awkward use of the phrase in two opposite meanings, with words of clearer definition added, points more or less strongly towards a probability that the passage as it stands was written or revised at a later date.

That the tribe was divided at all can only be explained by the pre-existence of some schism in its ranks, the probable origin and nature of which are discussed in the notes on verses 39, 41. The enormous increase in the tribal numbers during the wanderings (see on chapter Numbers 26:34) may have made the division more advisable, and the adventurous and independent character of the Machirites may have rendered it almost a necessity. They had not apparently preferred any request to Moses, but since the trans-Jordanic territory was to be occupied, Moses probably prevented a grave difficulty by recognizing their claim to the conquests they had made.

Dibon. Now Dhiban, four miles north of Arnon. It is called Dibon-gad in chapter Numbers 33:45, 46, but it is doubtful whether there is any allusion to its present occupation, since "Gad" was a common affix in the languages of Canaan (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>). Dibon was subsequently assigned to Reuben (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>), but was recovered by Moab, and became one of his strongholds (of <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18, 22</a>) The Moabite stone was found here. <span class="cmt_word">Ataroth.</span> Now Attarus, seven miles from Dibon. <span class="cmt_word">Aroer.</span> Not the Aroer before Rabbath (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), but the Aroer by the brink of Arnon (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>).

He now begins to take that secondary position which was always to be his. Of the towns which he now occupied, the Moabites recovered many, while the most important of all (Heshbon) had to be surrendered to the Levites. He was indeed compensated with the southern settlements of the Gadites as far as the Wady Hesban, but even so his limits were very straitened as compared with those of Gad and of half Manasseh. Heshbon. Cf. chapter Numbers 21:25. In <a href="../../par/joshua/21-39.htm">Joshua 21:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81</a>, Heshbon is spoken of as belonging to Gad. This can only be explained on the supposition that the temporary settlements of the two tribes were really intermixed, and that Heshbon, as the old capital of that region, was jointly occupied. In after times it, too, together with Elealeh and Kirjathaim, Nebo, Baal-meon, and Sibmah, all fell into the hands of Moab (<a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22, 23</a>).

In the absence of any direct information, we can only guess at the nature of the tie which united the Beni-Machir as a family, and kept them distinct from the other Manassite families. It is evident from their history that they formed a sub-tribe powerful enough to have a name of their own in Israel (cf. verse 40 and <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>, and see note on verse 41). <span class="cmt_word">Went to Gilead.</span> This would seem to refer to the expedition briefly recorded in chapter Numbers 21:33. It is mentioned here out of place, in the simple historical style of the Pentateuch, because the gift of Gilead to Machir grew out of its conquest by Machir. The name Gilead is again used in a very vague sense, for the territory actually allotted to Machir was rather in Bashan than in Gilead proper.

His genealogy, which is instructive and suggestive, is given here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It will be seen that Segub, the father of Jair, was a Machirite in the female line only. His father Hezron, according to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21</a>, married the daughter of Manasseh in his old age, when his elder sons were probably already fathers of families. It may probably be conjectured also that Manasseh, who must have inherited exceptional wealth (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>), and had but one grandson, left a large portion to his grand-daughter, the young wife of Hezron. It was therefore very natural that Segub should have attached himself to the fortunes of his mother's tribe. Is it not also very probable that Machir had other daughters (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23</a>), who also inherited large portions from their grandfather, and whose husbands were willing enough to enter into a family which had apparently brighter prospects than any others? If so, it would account at once for the existence of a large family of Machirites not descended from  Gilead, and not on the most friendly terms with the rest of the tribe. It is quite possible that many of the more adventurous spirits amongst the tribe of Judah joined themselves to a family whose reputation and exploits they might naturally claim as their own (see on Joshua 19:34). <span class="cmt_word">The small towns thereof,</span> or, "their villages." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, i.e. the hamlets of the Amorites who dwelt in Argob (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), the modern district of el Lejja, on the north-western waters of the Yermuk or Hieromax. <span class="cmt_word">And called them Havoth-jair.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>.

The word <span class="accented">chavvoth</span> only occurs in this connection, and is supposed by some to be the plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "life." There does not, however, seem to be anything except the very doubtful analogy of certain German names in favour of the rendering "Jair's lives." It is more likely the corruption of some more ancient name. There is some discrepancy in subsequent references to the Chavvoth-jair. According to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, Jair had twenty-three towns in Gilead; from <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a> it appears that the sons of the later Jair had thirty cities "in the land of Gilead" which went under the name of Chavvoth-jair; while in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a> "all the Chavvoth-jair which are in Bashan" are reckoned at sixty. The plausible, though not wholly satisfactory, explanation is, that the conquests of Nobah came to be subsequently included in those of his more famous contemporary, and the vague name of Chavvoth-jair extended to all the towns in that part of Gilead, and of Bashan too (see notes on the passages cited). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a></div><div class="verse">And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nobah.</span> As this chieftain is nowhere else named, we may probably conclude that he was one of the companions of Jair, holding a position more or less subordinate to him. <span class="cmt_word">Kenath</span>. The modern Kenawat, on the western slope of the Jebel Hauran, the most easterly point ever occupied by the Israelites. It is apparently the Nobah mentioned in <a href="../../par/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, but it has reverted (like so many others) to its old name. In spite of the uncertainties which hang over the conquest of this north-eastern territory, there is something very characteristic in the part played by the Machirite leaders. That they acted with an independent vigour bordering on audacity, that they showed great personal prowess, and had great personal authority with the humbler members of their family, and held something like the position of feudal superiors among them, is evident from the way in which they are spoken cf. And this is quite in keeping with the character of the Manassites in after times. The "governors" who came at the call of Barak, Gideon, the greatest of the warrior-judges, and probably Jephthah also ("the Gileadite"), as well as the younger Jail maintained the warlike and impetuous character of their race. If "Elijah the Tishbite" was really from this region (although this is extremely doubtful), we should find in him the characteristic daring and self-reliance of Machir transmuted into their spiritual equivalents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 33"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
