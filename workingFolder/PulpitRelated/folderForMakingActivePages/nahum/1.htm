The clouds are the dust of his feet, Large and  grand as the clouds look to us, they are to God but as the dust raised by the feet in walking. As an illustration of this statement (though, of course, the fact was utterly unknown to Nahum), it has been remarked that recent scientific discovery asserts that clouds owe their beauty, and even their very existence, to the presence of dust particles in the atmosphere. The aqueous vapour, it is said, condenses on these particles, and thus becomes visible.

So the Syriac and Arabic. Jerome interprets "the waters" to mean the heavenly powers (<a href="../../par/psalms/148-4.htm">Psalm 148:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet thus</span> (though such is their state) <span class="cmt_word">shall they be cut down.</span> The verb is used of the mowing of a fold or the shearing of sheep, and implies complete destruction. <span class="cmt_word">When he shall pass through;</span> better, <span class="accented">and he shall pass away.</span> The number is changed, but the same persons are meant, spoken of as one to show their insignificance and complete annihilation. Septuagint "Thus shall they be dispersed [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="accented">dividentur</span>, Jerome], and the report of thee shall no more be heard therein." The following clause is not translated. <span class="cmt_word">Though I have afflicted thee.</span> The Lord addresses Judah, referring to the oppression of Judaea by the Assyriaus in the times of Ahaz and Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-18.htm">2 Kings 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20</a>, etc.; 32.). <span class="cmt_word">I will afflict thee no more;</span> according to the promise in ver. 9. This is further confirmed in what follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nahum/1-13.htm">Nahum 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His yoke.</span> The yoke of Assyria, probably referring to the vassalage of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). (For the metaphor of "yoke" denoting subjugation, setup. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-27.htm">Ezekiel 34:27</a>.) Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-8.htm">Jeremiah 30:8</a>) seems to use these words of Nahum to announce the deliverance of Israel from captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Burst thy bonds in sunder;</span> by the final overthrow of the Assyrian power (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nahum/1-14.htm">Nahum 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, <i>that</i> no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concerning thee.</span> The prophet addresses the Assyrian, and announces God's purpose concerning him. <span class="cmt_word">That no more of thy name be sown.</span> There is no special reference to Sennacherib in this or the next clause, but the prophet means that the Assyrian people and name shall become extinct. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the house of thy gods</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>, whore the murder of Sennacherib in the temple of Nisroch is mentioned). An account of the religion of the Assyrians will be found in Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2 ch. 7. <span class="cmt_word">Graven image;</span> carved out of wood or stone. <span class="cmt_word">Molten</span>; cast in metal. The two terms comprise every kind of idol, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3</a>. The Assyrians used to destroy the images of the gods worshipped by conquered  nations (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>). Bonomi ('Nineveh and its Palaces,' p. 163) gives a picture of soldiers cutting up the image of some foreign deity, and carrying away the pieces. So should it now be done unto their gods. <span class="cmt_word">I will make thy grave.</span> I will consign thee, O Assyrian, and thy idols to oblivion (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22</a>, etc.). It is not, "I will make it, the temple, thy grave," as those who see a reference to the death of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>) render it; but, "I prepare thy grave" - I doom thee to destruction. The reason is given: <span class="cmt_word">For thou art vile;</span> <span class="accented">quia inhonoratus es</span> (Vulgate): <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "for they are swift" (Septuagint). The word is also translated "light," weighed in the balances, and found wanting, as <a href="../../par/daniel/5-27.htm">Daniel 5:27</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The second chapter commences here in the Hebrew and Syriac; the Anglican follows the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Chaldee Versions. This seems most agreeable to the method of the prophecy, wherein threat is succeeded by promise, denunciation of the enemy by declaration of comfort to Judah (comp. <a href="../../par/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6, 7, 12</a>, and 13; so here vers. 14 and 15). The prophet announces the joy with which Judah receives the news of the overthrow of Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">Behold upon the mountains,</span> etc. Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>) uses these words to proclaim the coming of Messiah (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>). The messengers come from the East across the mountains of Palestine, announcing the fall of Nineveh and the consequent peace and security of Judah - a type of the overthrow of God's enemies and the safety of his Church. There may be an allusion to the custom of spreading tidings by beacon fires. <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy solemn feasts.</span> Judah is exhorted to resume the observation of her solemnities, which were interrupted during the enemy's occupation of the country, or which could not be properly attended by the distant inhabitants. Judah must offer her praises and thanksgivings for deliverance, and <span class="cmt_word">perform the vows</span> which she made unto the Lord in the time of peril. <span class="cmt_word">The wicked</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">Belial</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall no more pass through thee.</span> <span class="accented">Belial</span> is here the adversary, the opposing army (see ver. 11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../micah/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Micah 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Micah 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nahum/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nahum 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nahum 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
