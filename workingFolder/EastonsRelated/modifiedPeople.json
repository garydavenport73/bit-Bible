Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam (  Exodus 2:1   Exodus 2:4  ;   7:7  ). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah (  6:23  ;   1�Chronicles 2:10  ), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God (  Exodus 4:14   Exodus 4:27-30  ) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the \"mouth\" or \"prophet\" of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance (  Exodus 7:1   Exodus 7:2   Exodus 7:9   Exodus 7:10   Exodus 7:19  ). He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with Pharaoh.    When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister's husband, who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory (  17:8-13  ).    Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the glory of Israel's God (  Exodus 19:24  ;   24:9-11  ). While Moses remained on the mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship (  Exodus 32:4  ;   Psalms 106:19  ). On the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before God, who forgave his sin (  Deuteronomy 9:20  ).    On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priest's office (  Leviticus 8  ;   9  ). Aaron, as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.    When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in \"the wilderness of Paran,\" Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, \"because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married,\" probably after the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam with leprosy (  Numbers 12  ). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister's guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven.    Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the interposition of Aaron (  Numbers 16  ). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron \"for the house of Levi\" budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds (  Numbers 17:1-10  ). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle (  Hebrews 9:4  ) as a memorial of the divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.    Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah (  Numbers 20:8-13  ), and on that account was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, \"in the edge of the land of Edom,\" at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years old (  Numbers 20:23-29  . Compare   Deuteronomy 10:6  ;   32:50  ), and was \"gathered unto his people.\" The people, \"even all the house of Israel,\" mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron's sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon. Aaron's other two sons had been struck dead (  Leviticus 10:1   Leviticus 10:2  ) for the daring impiety of offering \"strange fire\" on the alter of incense.    The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron's grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him.   He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, \"the house of Aaron,\" constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous (  1�Chronicles 12:27  ). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest. His priesthood was a \"shadow of heavenly things,\" and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when \"another priest\" would arise \"after the order of Melchizedek\" (  Hebrews 6:20  ).

His priesthood was a “shadow of heavenly things,” and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when “another priest” would arise “after the order of Melchizedek” ([Heb. 6:20](/heb#Heb.6.20))."],"modified":"2020-09-07T19:30:30.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recO5ToygNrV47m4M","fields":{"personLookup":"abagtha_3","personID":3,"name":"Abagtha","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec2wz80CtpQTDPVx"],"displayTitle":"Abagtha","status":"wip","eastons":["recYsJeplPg6fl7Dk"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-462,"maxYear":-462,"alphaGroup":"A","slug":"abagtha_3","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["One of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus’s court ([Esther 1:10](/esth#Esth.1.10); [2:21](/esth#Esth.2.21))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recDz3OHWVWZqjrOR","fields":{"personLookup":"abda_4","personID":4,"name":"Abda","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec9QUfUSghSfh6zc"],"children":["Hadoram 3"],"displayTitle":"Abda","status":"wip","eastons":["recVLvI68GVgsQqQe"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1014,"maxYear":-1014,"alphaGroup":"A","slug":"abda_4","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The father of Adoniram, whom Solomon set over the tribute ([1 Kings 4:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.6)); i.e., the forced labour (R.V., “levy”)."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recIaoifslP7mxktH","fields":{"personLookup":"abdeel_5","personID":5,"name":"Abdeel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recVesRslQqazoOqC"],"children":["Shelemiah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Abdeel","status":"wip","eastons":["recz2w5miFtQHWUos"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-606,"maxYear":-606,"alphaGroup":"A","slug":"abdeel_5","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Servant of God, ([Jer. 36:26](/jer#Jer.36.26)), the father of Shelemiah."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recCkdqG3oAlsPbjr","fields":{"personLookup":"abdi_6","personID":6,"name":"Abdi","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"verses":["recwkuSLA0p3SrGyk"],"father":["Malluch 1"],"children":["Kishi(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Abdi","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Abdi - A Levite, father of Kishi and grandfather of King David's singer Ethan.

Hebhel), a breath, or vanity, the second son of Adam and Eve. He was put to death by his brother Cain ([Gen. 4:1-16](/gen#Gen.4.1)). Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. “And in process of time” (marg. “at the end of days”, i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. “The Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect” ([Gen. 4:3-5](/gen#Gen.4.3)). On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect ([Gen. 4:8](/gen#Gen.4.8), [9](/gen#Gen.4.9). Comp. [1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as “righteous” ([Matt. 23:35](/matt#Matt.23.35)). “The blood of sprinkling” is said to speak “better things than that of Abel” ([Heb. 12:24](/heb#Heb.12.24)); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said ([Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)) that “Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” This sacrifice was made “by faith;” this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that “faith” which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel’s offering was accepted of God. Cain’s offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die.\n\n Abel (Heb. ‘abhel), lamentation ([1 Sam. 6:18](/1sam#1Sam.6.18)), the name given to the great stone in Joshua’s field whereon the ark was “set down.” The Revised Version, however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text ’ebhen (= a stone), and accordingly translates “unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark.” This reading is to be preferred.\n\n Abel (Heb. ‘abhel), a grassy place, a meadow.

He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader ([1 Sam. 30:7](/1sam#1Sam.30.7)). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest ([1 Chr. 15:11](/1chr#1Chr.15.11); [1 Kings 2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26)) and the “king’s companion” ([1 Chr. 27:34](/1chr#1Chr.27.34)). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David’s reign ([1 Kings 4:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.4)). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar ([1 Sam. 2:30-36](/1sam#1Sam.2.30); [1 Kings 1:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.19); [2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26), [27](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.27)). Zadok now became sole high priest. In [Mark 2:26](/mark#Mark.2.26), reference is made to an occurrence in “the days of Abiathar the high priest.” But from [1 Sam. 22](/1sam#1Sam.22), we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to.

He began his three years’ reign ([2 Chr. 12:16](/2chr#2Chr.12.16); [13:1](/2chr#2Chr.13.1), [2](/2chr#2Chr.13.2)) with a strenuous but unsuccessful effort to bring back the ten tribes to their allegiance. His address to “Jeroboam and all Israel,” before encountering them in battle, is worthy of being specially noticed ([2 Chr. 13:5-12](/2chr#2Chr.13.5)). It was a very bloody battle, no fewer than 500,000 of the army of Israel having perished on the field. He is described as having walked “in all the sins of his father” ([1 Kings 15:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.3); [2 Chr. 11:20-22](/2chr#2Chr.11.20)). It is said in [1 Kings 15:2](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.2) that “his mother’s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom;” but in [2 Chr. 13:2](/2chr#2Chr.13.2) we read, “his mother’s name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.” The explanation is that Maachah is just a variation of the name Michaiah, and that Abishalom is probably the same as Absalom, the son of David. It is probable that “Uriel of Gibeah” married Tamar, the daughter of Absalom ([2 Sam. 14:27](/2sam#2Sam.14.27)), and by her had Maachah.

He first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over Goliath ([1 Sam. 17:57](/1sam#1Sam.17.57)). After the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king ([2 Sam. 2:8](/2sam#2Sam.2.8)). A state of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth’s army, was fought with David’s army under Joab at Gibeon ([2 Sam. 2:12](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)). Abner, escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was “light of foot as a wild roe,” the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his spear ([2 Sam. 2](/2sam#2Sam.2): 18-32).\n\n Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he found an excuse for going over to the side of David, whom he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over all Israel. David received him favourably, and promised that he would have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absent from Hebron, but on his return he found what had happened. Abner had just left the city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the gate of the city on his return, thrust him through with his sword ([2 Sam. 3:27](/2sam#2Sam.3.27), [31](/2sam#2Sam.3.31)-39; 4:12.

Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God (  Acts 7:2-4  ). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in   Genesis 12  . While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God (  Genesis 12:1   Genesis 12:2  ); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, \"not knowing whither he went\" (  Hebrews 11:8  ). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.    Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem (  Genesis 12:6  ), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, \"I will make of thee a great nation,\" etc. (  Genesis 12:2   Genesis 12:3   Genesis 12:7  ). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted (  Genesis 3:15  ). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to \"Jehovah.\" He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh (  Genesis 12:18  ). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, \"in cattle, in silver, and in gold\" (  Genesis 12:8  ;   13:2  . Compare   Psalms 105:13   Psalms 105:14  ). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot's shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Compare   1�Corinthians 6:7  .) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or \"oak-grove\" of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called \"the oak of Mamre\" (  Genesis 13:18  ). This was his third resting-place in the land.    Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God (  Genesis 14:18-20  ).    In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel (  Genesis 14:1  ), one of the witnesses is called \"the Amorite, the son of Abiramu,\" or Abram.    Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged (  Genesis 13:14  ). \"The word of the Lord\" (an expression occurring here for the first time) \"came to him\" (  15:1  ). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises (  Genesis 16  ). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch's name was now changed from Abram to Abraham (  Genesis 17:4   Genesis 17:5  ), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai's name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God's thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised (  Genesis 17  ). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the \"smoke of a furnace\" (  Genesis 19:1-28  ).    After fifteen years' residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King (  Genesis 20  ). (See  ABIMELECH ) Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham's heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham (  Genesis 21:12  ). (See HAGAR;  ISHMAEL.)   At this point there is a blank in the patriarch's history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test (  Hebrews 11:17-19  ). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., \"The Lord will provide.\" The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba (  Genesis 22:19  ), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.    Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite (  Genesis 23  ); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran,   Acts 7:2  ), where his brother Nahor and his family resided (  Genesis 11:31  ). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor's son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac (  Genesis 24  ). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the \"children of the east\" (  Judges 6:3  ), and later as \"Saracens.\" At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah (  Genesis 25:7-10  ).

Count":1,"dictText":["Father of a multitude, son of Terah, named ([Gen. 11:27](/gen#Gen.11.27)) before his older brothers Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir of the promises. Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God ([Acts 7:2-4](/acts#Acts.7.2)). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in [Gen. 12](/gen#Gen.12). While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God ([Gen. 12:1](/gen#Gen.12.1), [2](/gen#Gen.12.2)); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, “not knowing whither he went” ([Heb. 11:8](/heb#Heb.11.8)). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.\n\n Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6)), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, “I will make of thee a great nation,” etc. ([Gen. 12:2](/gen#Gen.12.2), [3](/gen#Gen.12.3), [7](/gen#Gen.12.7)). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to “Jehovah.” He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh ([Gen. 12:18](/gen#Gen.12.18)). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, “in cattle, in silver, and in gold” ([Gen. 12:8](/gen#Gen.12.8); [13:2](/gen#Gen.13.2). Comp. [Ps. 105:13](/ps#Ps.105.13), [14](/ps#Ps.105.14)). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot’s shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Comp. [1 Cor. 6:7](/1cor#1Cor.6.7).) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or “oak-grove” of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called “the oak of Mamre” ([Gen. 13:18](/gen#Gen.13.18)). This was his third resting-place in the land.\n\n Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God ([Gen. 14:18-20](/gen#Gen.14.18)).\n\n In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel ([Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1)), one of the witnesses is called “the Amorite, the son of Abiramu,” or Abram.\n\n Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged ([Gen. 13:14](/gen#Gen.13.14)). “The word of the Lord” (an expression occurring here for the first time) “came to him” (15:1). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises ([Gen. 16](/gen#Gen.16)). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch’s name was now changed from Abram to Abraham ([Gen. 17:4](/gen#Gen.17.4), [5](/gen#Gen.17.5)), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai’s name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God’s thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised ([Gen. 17](/gen#Gen.17)). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the “smoke of a furnace” ([Gen. 19:1-28](/gen#Gen.19.1)).\n\n After fifteen years’ residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King ([Gen. 20](/gen#Gen.20)). Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham’s heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham ([Gen. 21:12](/gen#Gen.21.12)). (See  HAGAR; ISHMAEL.)\n\n At this point there is a blank in the patriarch’s history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test ([Heb. 11:17-19](/heb#Heb.11.17)). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., “The Lord will provide.” The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba ([Gen. 22:19](/gen#Gen.22.19)), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.\n\n Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite ([Gen. 23](/gen#Gen.23)); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran, [Acts 7:2](/acts#Acts.7.2)), where his brother Nahor and his family resided ([Gen. 11:31](/gen#Gen.11.31)). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor’s son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac ([Gen. 24](/gen#Gen.24)). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the “children of the east” ([Judg. 6:3](/judg#Judg.6.3)), and later as “Saracens.” At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah ([Gen. 25:7-10](/gen#Gen.25.7)).\n\n The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on the ancient world, and references to it are interwoven in the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He is called “the friend of God” ([James 2:23](/jas#Jas.2.23)), “faithful Abraham” ([Gal. 3:9](/gal#Gal.3.9)), “the father of us all” ([Rom. 4:16](/rom#Rom.4.16))."],"eventGroups":["Abraham's Sojourn in Canaan","Abraham's Sojourn in Canaan","Abraham's Sojourn in Canaan"],"modified":"2020-09-07T00:30:09.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recEdhjnlbofKC5rc","fields":{"personLookup":"absalom_59","personID":59,"name":"Absalom","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","deathYear":["recTRIFHNZIvaLInF"],"memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"birthPlace":["recJSfVnIcPibY6aX"],"verses":["recg6uC3qcxQYgLBv","recvx4sT4EVlJY3iC","rect34B1DjHH8MJXZ","recNrxCFfV2ow9KEF","recoqVMczBjvV3v5G","recO5DLzuiR6SjLk4","recBsWSc6Qz5xLrJP","recLmy266rChxrwIc","recVWKcctxEN4GQWs","rechcJkdOols3F5bK","recaZ2bUJ4Qfjk6Yh","reczifNlHrA8kRZdU","rec8TTmCfLZLLlmKY","recxo8LO6yuwO9nmE","recJZ9Yv8MMB6tMtB","recQsuAXTqHmHv7OL","rec3ukC5gTXBPsvBt","recjA1PvQmkfrzQRr","reczxuq62TduxZfyK","rec4KvKg09SqNOpLc","recvBcApYjluGe0ve","recsEmkAgn0zI4jVh","recNqHvc7iZn86jq0","recbhB1QJlM0c1w4c","rec7I0BN4e46ZmIoj","rechvz9kngxECIX29","recmjlE5WNq7gjIvi","recYQrFDWdBS70q2E","recrKvAU2nFAyGX3n","recpmQdmA18ekGR3C","reccz6EeB1ngVfi9N","recbQlmrxJX4SWcUb","rec0hVDcCytW1KIEQ","recUb8Y0pZaOA5Dux","recIF4HmDq9sL9Dk9","rec8e7g2YK3axigtj","recDOEXV31Gjzth5E","recctJOOP8PMbNrig","receDmfyXYoJT1f2L","recNjyYzdhQyeA83a","recNsbAISCKcCixwC","recsBVTNWmzOmk3lA","recyY8ZAtMW2Ht75O","recqmBrZPoQhR2FCG","recQjqVAAuoPZmSne","recwvNHqVDkPMRDyJ","rec9IbUNq9j3e0FkR","recLlknjAhc2H4UsL","recYkLr1l2L4ZJuEu","rec6vf3UaAykiAybN","recOSHor05G2MZzWR","rec0SdJACFLp033Ig","recoUp9C9WTXxbf2R","rect7LGKKAroY98gC","recGg57OMmlY1ilVe","recJKaSknjv0ivhho","recsxSAChC1nEFrRH","recl9OC6IsYgmzor2","reczA7eWzVmg4ip9J","recKrGiyc70NFWNbZ","recoGmbrYI1F84O9b","recdwOta0zrcaNZ6T","rec3QiCfwtexfIOIA","recC6UGbt8R94RQ8e","reccDLGZ3UZ47hoFe","rec9xQFwxDD0VwsG1","recokZ0tsyHAT6Lgm","recYgzkZ2pakelK1H","recmGsDKVaG8A31lX","rec5Dwyov6VFIi0of","receHMGvXDtwYg956","recw3Sv8r4bUOSE81","recwd00gTLRNxEUkd","recwJfxzHOWQd6taB","recvuBnMPaFUFHA13","receela5iJiUIg5dO","recL3mBhtKc1AhAEZ","recpLZxAe6q17PQX9","recV0yiIXGbbIlxSP","recxg9pnkidvvX0By","recfsF2UXwICpxneD","recoQpqsgZiBzXQBf","recyli1mdvkRrZdg5","rec9lN7bK2L1Hle1n","recIB9O0tUsXRS1hX","reckubJKOfhv4gKRW","recTABm7YQ7XCsGCZ","recPuUdlJYaOE1BZn","recRt1PTpLdWal7GG","rectqg1MuX7EhfDno","recujE0ZZrbvvDy7G"],"siblings":["Japhia 2","Jerimoth 6","Eliada 1","Eliphalet","Elpalet(no entry)","Elishama 2","Elishua","Ibhar","Nepheg(no entry)","Nogah","Tamar 3"],"halfSiblingsSameFather":["Adonijah 1","Amnon 2","Ithream(no entry)","Daniel 1","Nathan 2","Shimea 1","Shephatiah(no entry)","Shobab 1","Solomon"],"mother":["Maachah 1"],"father":["David"],"children":["Tamar 4"],"displayTitle":"Absalom","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Abishalom","eastons":["recTULNeRHi6CeR2q"],"verseCount":91,"minYear":-1053,"maxYear":-955,"alphaGroup":"A","slug":"absalom_59","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Father of peace; i.e., “peaceful” David’s son by Maacah ([2 Sam. 3:3](/2sam#2Sam.3.3); comp.

Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years ([2 Sam. 3:3](/2sam#2Sam.3.3); [13:23-38](/2sam#2Sam.13.23)).\n\n David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt of fratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a woman of Tekoah, Joab received David’s sanction to invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years elapsed before his father admitted him into his presence ([2 Sam. 14:28](/2sam#2Sam.14.28)). Absalom was now probably the oldest surviving son of David, and as he was of royal descent by his mother as well as by his father, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions were favoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection; and after his return from Geshur ([2 Sam. 15:7](/2sam#2Sam.15.7); marg., R.V.) he went up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The revolt was so successful that David found it necessary to quit Jerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had been David’s chief counsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but only for the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so to advantage David’s cause. He was so far successful that by his advice, which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom delayed to march an army against his father, who thus gained time to prepare for the defence.\n\n Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army, under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of the forest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom’s army were slain in that fatal battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the bough of an oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab came up and pierced him through with three darts. His body was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest, and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David, as he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told that Absalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!” ([2 Sam. 18:33](/2sam#2Sam.18.33). Comp. [Ex. 32:32](/exod#Exod.32.32); [Rom. 9:3](/rom#Rom.9.3)).\n\n Absalom’s three sons ([2 Sam. 14:27](/2sam#2Sam.14.27); comp. 18:18) had all died before him, so that he left only a daughter, Tamar, who became the grandmother of Abijah."],"modified":"2020-07-10T11:56:53.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recDTsFXpdWcBaR2d","fields":{"personLookup":"achaicus_60","personID":60,"name":"Achaicus","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recfbTJZDfh20ZPFn"],"displayTitle":"Achaicus","status":"wip","eastons":["recxls7TKTCnnqYHb"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":59,"maxYear":59,"alphaGroup":"A","slug":"achaicus_60","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["([1 Cor. 16:17](/1cor#1Cor.16.17)), one of the members of the church of Corinth who, with Fortunatus and Stephanas, visited Paul while he was at Ephesus, for the purpose of consulting him on the affairs of the church.

It was the name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book of Moses ([Gen. 1:27](/gen#Gen.1.27)-ch. 5). “God created man [Heb., Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.”\n\n Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He was formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and gave him dominion over all the lower creatures ([Gen. 1:26](/gen#Gen.1.26); [2:7](/gen#Gen.2.7)). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: “Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”\n\n The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God brought to him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in an unconscious state took one of his ribs, and closed up his flesh again; and of this rib he made a woman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received her as his wife, and said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” He called her Eve, because she was the mother of all living.\n\n Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also did eat. Thus man fell, and brought upon himself and his posterity all the sad consequences of his transgression. The narrative of the Fall comprehends in it the great promise of a Deliverer ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)), the “first gospel” message to man. They were expelled from Eden, and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which turned every way, to prevent access to the tree of life ([Gen. 3](/gen#Gen.3)). How long they were in Paradise is matter of mere conjecture.\n\n Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her first-born, and called him Cain. Although we have the names of only three of Adam’s sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and Seth, yet it is obvious that he had several sons and daughters ([Gen. 5:4](/gen#Gen.5.4)). He died aged 930 years.\n\n Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race. Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity of the human race.

To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive, he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war ([1 Kings 22:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.3)) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow from a bow “drawn at a venture” pierced him, and though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah’s prophecy ([1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)) was fulfilled.

The discrepancy supposed to exist between [Deut. 1:44](/deut#Deut.1.44) and [Num. 14:45](/num#Num.14.45) is explained by the circumstance that the terms “Amorites” and “Amalekites” are used synonymously for the “Canaanites.” In the same way we explain the fact that the “Hivites” of [Gen. 34:2](/gen#Gen.34.2) are the “Amorites” of 48:22.

The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last “of the remnant of the giants” ([Deut. 3:11](/deut#Deut.3.11)). Both Sihon and Og were independent kings.

His wife was called “the prophetess” (8:3), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah ([Judg. 4:4](/judg#Judg.4.4)) and Huldah ([2 Kings 22:14-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.14)), or simply because she was the wife of “the prophet” ([Isa. 38:1](/isa#Isa.38.1)). He had two sons, who bore symbolical names.\n\n He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah’s death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.\n\n His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him “in the year that King Uzziah died” ([Isa. 6:1](/isa#Isa.6.1)). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward “the holy One of Israel.”\n\n In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.), [2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19); and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria ([2 Kings 16:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.5); [2 Chr. 28:5](/2chr#2Chr.28.5), [6](/2chr#2Chr.28.6)). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29); [16:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.9); [1 Chr. 5:26](/1chr#1Chr.5.26)). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who “rebelled against the king of Assyria” ([2 Kings 18:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.7)), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah ([Isa. 10:24](/isa#Isa.10.24); [37:6](/isa#Isa.37.6)), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt ([Isa. 30:2-4](/isa#Isa.30.2)). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ([2 Kings 18:14-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.14)). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ([Isa. 36:2-22](/isa#Isa.36.2); [37:8](/isa#Isa.37.8)). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (37:1-7), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he “spread before the Lord” (37:14). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. “Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt.” The remaining years of Hezekiah’s reign were peaceful ([2 Chr. 32:23](/2chr#2Chr.32.23), [27](/2chr#2Chr.32.27)-29). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.)."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recm8T4T88x63KjyC","fields":{"personLookup":"asaiah_325","personID":325,"name":"Asaiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recu3jAlIabopj1fp"],"displayTitle":"Asaiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1721,"maxYear":-1721,"alphaGroup":"A","slug":"asaiah_325","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recvlh16MeV75W4od","fields":{"personLookup":"asaiah_326","personID":326,"name":"Asaiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"verses":["recNivRmVvgVbfIX3"],"father":["Haggiah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Asaiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"A descendant of Merari and a head of a paternal house.

He resided at Pethor ([Deut. 23:4](/deut#Deut.23.4)), in Mesopotamia ([Num. 23:7](/num#Num.23.7)). It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam “from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,” to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak’s wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers (2 Pet. 2:15, [16](/2pet#2Pet.2.16)) to this as an historical event. In [Micah 6:5](/mic#Mic.6.5) reference also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them ([Num. 25](/num#Num.25)). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting on the side of Balak ([Num. 31:8](/num#Num.31.8)).\n\n The “doctrine of Balaam” is spoken of in [Rev. 2:14](/rev#Rev.2.14), in allusion to the fact that it was through the teaching of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin.

His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch (  13:1  ). Luke speaks of him as a \"good man\" (  11:24  ). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land (  Acts 4:36   Acts 4:37  ), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding (  Acts 14:11   Acts 14:12  ). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (  9:27  ). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.    The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year (  Acts 11:25   Acts 11:26  ). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there (  11:28-30  ). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor (  Acts 13:14  ). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church (  Acts 15:2  :   Galatians 2:1  ). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.    When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again.

His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch (13:1). Luke speaks of him as a “good man” (11:24). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land ([Acts 4:36](/acts#Acts.4.36), [37](/acts#Acts.4.37)), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding ([Acts 14:11](/acts#Acts.14.11), [12](/acts#Acts.14.12)). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (9:27). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.\n\n The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year ([Acts 11:25](/acts#Acts.11.25), [26](/acts#Acts.11.26)). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there (11:28-30). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor ([Acts 13:14](/acts#Acts.13.14)). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ([Acts 15:2](/acts#Acts.15.2): [Gal. 2:1](/gal#Gal.2.1)). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.\n\n When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by Saul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Saul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited Cyprus ([Acts 15:36-41](/acts#Acts.15.36)).

He was the son of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and the widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still young he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and when heated with wine sent for the sacred vessels his “father” ([Dan. 5:2](/dan#Dan.5.2)), or grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in Jerusalem, and he and his princes drank out of them. In the midst of their mad revelry a hand was seen by the king tracing on the wall the announcement of God’s judgment, which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the queen (i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he interpreted the writing. That night the kingdom of the Chaldeans came to an end, and the king was slain ([Dan. 5:30](/dan#Dan.5.30)).\n\n The absence of the name of Belshazzar on the monuments was long regarded as an argument against the genuineness of the Book of Daniel. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson found an inscription of Nabonidus which referred to his eldest son. Quite recently, however, the side of a ravine undermined by heavy rains fell at Hillah, a suburb of Babylon. A number of huge, coarse earthenware vases were laid bare. These were filled with tablets, the receipts and contracts of a firm of Babylonian bankers, which showed that Belshazzar had a household, with secretaries and stewards. One was dated in the third year of the king Marduk-sar-uzur. As Marduk-sar-uzar was another name for Baal, this Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar of Scripture. In one of these contract tablets, dated in the July after the defeat of the army of Nabonidus, we find him paying tithes for his sister to the temple of the sun-god at Sippara."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recxUATsCvH3jZLT3","fields":{"personLookup":"ben_438","personID":438,"name":"Ben","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec9RDsDbGGf5ezuZ"],"displayTitle":"Ben","status":"wip","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1042,"maxYear":-1042,"alphaGroup":"B","slug":"ben_438","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recwmFAt1MMUiL8dC","fields":{"personLookup":"ben-ammi_451","personID":451,"name":"Ben-ammi","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recjfbZQupofM5bQl","rec8RTZBh3BqLQfoP"],"halfSiblingsSameFather":["Daughter of Lot - Younger(no entry)","Daughter of Lot - Older(no entry)","Moab 1"],"mother":["Daughter of Lot - Younger(no entry)"],"father":["Lot"],"displayTitle":"Ben-ammi","status":"wip","eastons":["recNBpZeEGJpBced7"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-1896,"maxYear":-1896,"alphaGroup":"B","slug":"ben-ammi_451","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Son of my kindred; i.e., “born of incest”, the son of Lot by his youngest daughter ([Gen. 19:38](/gen#Gen.19.38))."],"modified":"2020-07-16T13:42:18.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recGpetgbThAidJR4","fields":{"personLookup":"ben-hadad_452","personID":452,"name":"Ben-hadad","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recfPtzYTz1djiIo5","recWCiH3AY8HNDrU4","recMxH1cQBmPoNOt8","recvGOYoqEETFJ21H","recEJstckHI0oI6uo","recUXEokmGKnuhowX","rec0c5M8Z6ve60nyi","recSo90M7ztUDQ6MW","rec9XeNBk3FN3I6rw","recnqFAtdiRGbAd3A","recwd1PSwx1oxxomi","recjXXnLX6EsaIWOG","recA4m5FqcjMKrTJA","recNiK2yScdyIRp8W","recYfUdPCKYXBOtbG","recyOOrGxOefjBXy5","reclEq3lKBRKZeEUq","recJiHvY2uIxaT15l"],"father":["Tabrimon"],"displayTitle":"Ben-hadad","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Ben-hadad (ruler of Damascus)","eastons":["recKAbK1ggkC6JwhL"],"verseCount":18,"minYear":-930,"maxYear":-583,"alphaGroup":"B","slug":"ben-hadad_452","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The king of Syria whom Asa, king of Judah, employed to invade Israel ([1 Kings 15:18](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.18))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recy66BXDcJUm7Ijh","fields":{"personLookup":"ben-hadad_453","personID":453,"name":"Ben-hadad","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec007kGfmEbvu1by","reclI5cJHOh5ACnlB","reciDfYpYF577Wyww"],"displayTitle":"Ben-hadad","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Ben-hadad(The king of Syria whom Asa, king of Judah, employed to invade Israel ( 1 Kings 15:18 ).)","eastons":["recZB9ryplDsEFJTJ"],"verseCount":3,"minYear":-893,"maxYear":-885,"alphaGroup":"B","slug":"ben-hadad_453","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Son of the preceding, also king of Syria.

The younger son of Jacob by Rachel (  Genesis 35:18  ). His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called Benjamites (  Genesis 49:27  ;   Deuteronomy 33:12  ;   Joshua 18:21  ).    The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one (  Numbers 1:36   Numbers 1:37  ;   Psalms 68:27  ). During the march its place was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of Jacob (  Genesis 49:27  ) that the figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in   Romans 11:1  ; Phil   3:5  .    The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in   Joshua 18:21-28  .    The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated (  Judges 20:20   Judges 20:21  ;   21:10  ). (See  GIBEAH  .)   The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the time of David (  2 Samuel 19:16   2 Samuel 19:17  ), which continued after his death (  1�Kings 11:13  ;   12:20  ). After the Exile these two tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation (  Ezra 1:5  ;   10:9  ).    The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers (  1 Samuel 20:20   1 Samuel 20:36  ;   2  Sam   1:22  ;   1�Chronicles 8:40  ;   12:2  ) and slingers (Judge.   20:6  ).

His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called Benjamites ([Gen. 49:27](/gen#Gen.49.27); [Deut. 33:12](/deut#Deut.33.12); [Josh. 18:21](/josh#Josh.18.21)).\n\n The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one ([Num. 1:36](/num#Num.1.36), [37](/num#Num.1.37); [Ps. 68:27](/ps#Ps.68.27)). During the march its place was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of Jacob ([Gen. 49:27](/gen#Gen.49.27)) that the figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in [Rom. 11:1](/rom#Rom.11.1); [Phil. 3:5](/phil#Phil.3.5).\n\n The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in [Josh. 18:21-28](/josh#Josh.18.21).\n\n The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated ([Judg. 20:20](/judg#Judg.20.20), [21](/judg#Judg.20.21); 21:10).\n\n The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the time of David ([2 Sam. 19:16](/2sam#2Sam.19.16), [17](/2sam#2Sam.19.17)), which continued after his death ([1 Kings 11:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.13); [12:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.20)). After the Exile these two tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation ([Ezra 1:5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5); [10:9](/ezra#Ezra.10.9)).\n\n The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers ([1 Sam. 20:20](/1sam#1Sam.20.20), [36](/1sam#1Sam.20.36); [2 Sam. 1:22](/2sam#2Sam.1.22); [1 Chr. 8:40](/1chr#1Chr.8.40); [12:2](/1chr#1Chr.12.2)) and slingers (Judge. 20:6).\n\n The gate of Benjamin, on the north side of Jerusalem ([Jer. 37:13](/jer#Jer.37.13); [38:7](/jer#Jer.38.7); [Zech. 14:10](/zech#Zech.14.10)), was so called because it led in the direction of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.

He was “a sullen, self-willed, haughty, vindictive man; wanting the religious element in his character, and defiant even in his attitude towards God.” It came to pass “in process of time” (marg. “at the end of days”), i.e., probably on the Sabbath, that the two brothers presented their offerings to the Lord. Abel’s offering was of the “firstlings of his flock and of the fat,” while Cain’s was “of the fruit of the ground.” Abel’s sacrifice was “more excellent” ([Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)) than Cain’s, and was accepted by God. On this account Cain was “very wroth,” and cherished feelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was at length guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to death ([1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). For this crime he was expelled from Eden, and henceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon him some mark which God had set upon him in answer to his own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected from the wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign to assure him that he would not be slain ([Gen. 4:15](/gen#Gen.4.15)). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth, he went forth into the “land of Nod”, i.e., the land of “exile”, which is said to have been in the “east of Eden,” and there he built a city, the first we read of, and called it after his son’s name, Enoch.

Many centuries before the age of Abraham, Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula had been conquered by Babylonian kings, and in the time of Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a dynasty which claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings of the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at once South Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the dynasty was Khammu-rabi, who united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon its capital. When he ascended the throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of Babylon (the Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the Biblical Ellasar). The king of Larsa was Eri-Aku (“the servant of the moon-god”), the son of an Elamite prince, Kudur-Mabug, who is entitled “the father of the land of the Amorites.” A recently discovered tablet enumerates among the enemies of Khammu-rabi, Kudur-Lagamar (“the servant of the goddess Lagamar”) or Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and Tudkhula or Tidal.

From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ([Gen. 2:13](/gen#Gen.2.13), R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt ([Ezek. 29:10](/ezek#Ezek.29.10), A.V. “Ethiopia,” Heb. Cush), with which it is generally associated ([Ps. 68:31](/ps#Ps.68.31); [Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Jer. 46:9](/jer#Jer.46.9), etc.). It stands also associated with Elam ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)), with Persia ([Ezek. 38:5](/ezek#Ezek.38.5)), and with the Sabeans ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ([Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Zeph. 3:10](/zeph#Zeph.3.10), Heb. Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites “from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.” The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation."],"modified":"2020-05-17T01:54:23.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recIauM7ngrOI4BwH","fields":{"personLookup":"cush_963","personID":963,"name":"Cush","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","displayTitle":"Cush (a Benjamite)","status":"wip","Disambiguation (temp)":"Cush (Lord concerning)","verseCount":0,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"C","slug":"cush_963","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2020-07-10T11:58:14.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recqXcKzSpUe7lXej","fields":{"personLookup":"cushi_964","personID":964,"name":"Cushi","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recNHuuQuoF6Xcj3F","reckk2YhECoVuXqKF","recNSdi3OguTCQP6d","recE8EYT5psHuVqhX","receela5iJiUIg5dO"],"displayTitle":"Cushi","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Cushi (Then Joab said to a Cushite)","verseCount":5,"minYear":-1023,"maxYear":-1023,"alphaGroup":"C","slug":"cushi_964","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recj3Z9DRUe9b3rL9","fields":{"personLookup":"cushi_965","personID":965,"name":"Cushi","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recXwECSju7AyLkZU"],"children":["Shelemiah 6"],"displayTitle":"Cushi","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Cushi (great-grandfather of Jehudi)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-606,"maxYear":-606,"alphaGroup":"C","slug":"cushi_965","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recydlCCsrbxwZYt7","fields":{"personLookup":"cushi_966","personID":966,"name":"Cushi","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recxwLpAQ4fvcRRxi"],"father":["Gedaliah(no entry)"],"children":["Zephaniah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Cushi","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Cushi (son of Gedaliah)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-630,"maxYear":-630,"alphaGroup":"C","slug":"cushi_966","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rechKkUsKYbIAm6OI","fields":{"personLookup":"cyrenius_967","personID":967,"name":"Cyrenius","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recHXbH5YYGbDeVL2"],"displayTitle":"Cyrenius","status":"wip","eastons":["recPbQpdjKsdwfOQ4"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"C","slug":"cyrenius_967","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The Grecized form of Quirinus.

Ko’resh), the celebrated “King of Persia” (Elam) who was conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of liberation to the Jews ([Ezra 1:1](/ezra#Ezra.1.1), [2](/ezra#Ezra.1.2)). He was the son of Cambyses, the prince of Persia, and was born about B.C. 599. In the year B.C. 559 he became king of Persia, the kingdom of Media being added to it partly by conquest. Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar’s feast ([Dan. 5:30](/dan#Dan.5.30)), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf., “Go up, O Elam”, [Isa. 21:2](/isa#Isa.21.2)).\n\n Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a “shepherd” ([Isa. 44:28](/isa#Isa.44.28); [45:1](/isa#Isa.45.1)). God employed him in doing service to his ancient people. He may posibly have gained, through contact with the Jews, some knowledge of their religion.\n\n The “first year of Cyrus” ([Ezra 1:1](/ezra#Ezra.1.1)) is not the year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year succeeding the two years during which “Darius the Mede” was viceroy in Babylon after its fall. At this time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actual king over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire. The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people ([2 Chr. 36:22](/2chr#2Chr.36.22), [23](/2chr#2Chr.36.23); [Ezra 1:1-4](/ezra#Ezra.1.1); [4:3](/ezra#Ezra.4.3); [5:13-17](/ezra#Ezra.5.13); [6:3-5](/ezra#Ezra.6.3)).\n\n This decree was discovered “at Achmetha [R.V. marg., “Ecbatana”], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes” ([Ezra 6:2](/ezra#Ezra.6.2)). A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus, gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus (Nabunahid), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire. In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered “without fighting,” and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to “all the province of Babylon,” of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of “king of Babylon,” claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recUt3VRWj3MN5Pg0","fields":{"personLookup":"dagon_969","personID":969,"name":"Dagon","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recMeIdBDybEZx5fY","recY5ef3MyRLvECjP","rec3gQ2eaXYTReSch","recTtU7hz2688cMlZ","rechab22vDrwXcz5u","recQ0M79oVECEtvQD","recPlNaN94dFNP83K"],"displayTitle":"Dagon","status":"wip","eastons":["reca6HQGEUzSouNWe"],"verseCount":7,"minYear":-1141,"maxYear":-1056,"alphaGroup":"D","slug":"dagon_969","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Little fish; diminutive from dag = a fish, the fish-god; the national god of the Philistines ([Judg. 16:23](/judg#Judg.16.23)).

They accordingly sent out five spies from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding that region. “Arise,” they said, “be not slothful to go, and to possess the land,” for it is “a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth” ([Judg. 18:10](/judg#Judg.18.10)). On receiving this report, 600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the conquered town to Dan ([Josh. 19:47](/josh#Josh.19.47)). This new city of Dan became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came to be denoted by the expression “from Dan to Beersheba”, i.e., about 144 miles.\n\n “But like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate tribe. Their name disappears from the roll-book of the natural and the spiritual Israel.”, Manning’s Those Holy Fields.\n\n This old border city was originally called Laish. Its modern name is Tell el-Kady, “Hill of the Judge.” It stands about four miles below Caesarea Philippi, in the midst of a region of surpassing richness and beauty."],"modified":"2020-09-06T23:51:45.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recyu5kO1cOOs8qIx","fields":{"personLookup":"daniel_939","personID":939,"name":"Daniel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E"],"birthPlace":["recJSfVnIcPibY6aX"],"verses":["recg6uC3qcxQYgLBv","recFVEUxiPqFHpsO0"],"siblings":["Japhia 2","Jerimoth 6","Eliada 1","Eliphalet","Elpalet(no entry)","Elishama 2","Elishua","Ibhar","Nepheg(no entry)","Nogah","Tamar 3"],"halfSiblingsSameFather":["Absalom","Adonijah 1","Amnon 2","Ithream(no entry)","Nathan 2","Shimea 1","Shephatiah(no entry)","Shobab 1","Solomon"],"mother":["Abigail 2"],"father":["David"],"displayTitle":"Daniel","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Chileab","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Daniel (was a celebrated Jewish scholar and master interpreter of dreams who was exiled to Babylon after the destruction of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.)","eastons":["reckwx7NoEEvAaXTj"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-1053,"maxYear":-1048,"alphaGroup":"D","slug":"daniel_939","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["David’s second son, “born unto him in Hebron, of Abigail the Carmelitess” ([1 Chr. 3:1](/1chr#1Chr.3.1)).

His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother's name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of   2�Samuel 17:25  . As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face (  1�Samuel 16:12  ;   17:42  ).    His early occupation was that of tending his father's sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd's flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club (  1 Samuel 17:34   1 Samuel 17:35  ).    While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction (  1�Samuel 16:1-13  ). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse's family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but \"the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward,\" and \"the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul\" (  1 Samuel 16:13   1 Samuel 16:14  ).    Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone \"out of the brook,\" which struck the giant's forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword (  1�Samuel 17  ). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.    David's popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul's jealousy (  1�Samuel 18:6-16  ), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death ( 1�Samuel 1830 -30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David \"prospered exceedingly,\" all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul's son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.    A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah (  1�Samuel 19:12-18  ) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel's training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David (  1�Samuel 20  ), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob (  21:1-9  ) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam (  22:1-4  ;   1�Chronicles 12:8-18  ). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, \"Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;\" when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed (  2�Samuel 23:13-17  ), but which he would not drink.    In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, \"persons who wore a linen ephod\", to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Compare   Psalms 52  .    Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it (  1�Samuel 23:1-14  ); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the \"hill country\" of Judah. Compare   Psalms 31  . While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement ( 23:16-18 ). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea (  1�Samuel 23:29  ). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail (  1�Samuel 25  ), whom David married after Nabal's death.    Saul again went forth (  1�Samuel 26  ) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself \"in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,\" in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.    Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines (  1�Samuel 27  ). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.    Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David's loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul's death (2Sam. 1). An Amalekite brought Saul's crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a \"lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son\" (  2�Samuel 1:18-27  ). It bore the title of \"The Bow,\" and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. \"Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher\" (q.v.).    David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction (  2�Samuel 2:1-4  ). There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.    But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul's only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed (  2 Samuel 3:1   2 Samuel 3:5  ), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon (  3:22-39  ). This was greatly to David's regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel (  4:1-12  ).    David king over all Israel (  2�Samuel 5:1-5  ;   1�Chronicles 11:1-3  ). The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, \"the stronghold\", on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel's capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.    David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital (  2�Samuel 6  ). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home (  1�Samuel 6  ;   7  ). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark,   Numbers 4  ), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Compare   Psalms 24  . Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now (  1�Chronicles 16  ) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth \"God's holy hill.\"    David's wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom (  2�Samuel 8  ). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway (  2�Samuel 8:3-13  ;   10  ).    David's fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery (  2�Samuel 11:2-27  ). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros (  23:39  ), was, by his order, \"set in the front of the hottest battle\" at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet (  2�Samuel 7:1-17  ;   12:1-23  ) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.    Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah's death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne (  2 Samuel 12:24   2 Samuel 12:25  ).    Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message (  2�Samuel 7:1-16  ). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace (  1�Chronicles 22:9  ;   28:3  ).    A cloudy evening. Hitherto David's carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime (  2�Samuel 13  ). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David's heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab (  2�Samuel 14  ).    After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years' famine (  2�Samuel 21:1-14  ). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David's sinful pride in numbering the people (  2�Samuel 24  ), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.    Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom's chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem (  2�Samuel 15:13-20  ), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim (  2�Samuel 18:1-8  ). Absalom's army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He \"went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept\" (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, \"Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\" Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel (  19:41-43  ). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.    The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David's life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build (  1�Chronicles 22  ;   28  ;   29  ), a house which was to be \"exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries\" (  22:5  ). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the \"Fuller's spring,\" in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah's party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father's throne (  1�Kings 1:11-53  ). David's last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises (  2�Samuel 23:1-7  ).    After a reign of forty years and six months (  2�Samuel 5:5  ;   1�Chronicles 3:4  ) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, \"and was buried in the city of David.\" His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.    Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah (  1�Samuel 16:13  ). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the \"Psalms of David,\" from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection. (See  PSALMS  .)   \"The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all (  2�Samuel 8:15  ). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron (  2�Samuel 5:5  ). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria.

Count":1,"dictText":["Beloved, the eighth and youngest son of Jesse, a citizen of Bethlehem. His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother’s name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of [2 Sam. 17:25](/2sam#2Sam.17.25). As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face ([1 Sam. 16:12](/1sam#1Sam.16.12); [17:42](/1sam#1Sam.17.42)).\n\n His early occupation was that of tending his father’s sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd’s flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club ([1 Sam. 17:34](/1sam#1Sam.17.34), [35](/1sam#1Sam.17.35)).\n\n While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction ([1 Sam. 16:1-13](/1sam#1Sam.16.1)). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse’s family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but “the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward,” and “the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul” ([1 Sam. 16:13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13), [14](/1sam#1Sam.16.14)).\n\n Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone “out of the brook,” which struck the giant’s forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword ([1 Sam. 17](/1sam#1Sam.17)). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.\n\n David’s popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul’s jealousy ([1 Sam. 18:6-16](/1sam#1Sam.18.6)), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death ([1 Sam. 18](/1sam#1Sam.18)-30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David “prospered exceedingly,” all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul’s son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.\n\n A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah ([1 Sam. 19:12-18](/1sam#1Sam.19.12)) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel’s training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David ([1 Sam. 20](/1sam#1Sam.20)), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob (21:1-9) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam (22:1-4; [1 Chr. 12:8-18](/1chr#1Chr.12.8)). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, “Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;” when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed ([2 Sam. 23:13-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.13)), but which he would not drink.\n\n In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, “persons who wore a linen ephod”, to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp. [Ps. 52](/ps#Ps.52).\n\n Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it ([1 Sam. 23:1-14](/1sam#1Sam.23.1)); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the “hill country” of Judah. Comp. [Ps. 31](/ps#Ps.31). While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement (23:16-18). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea ([1 Sam. 23:29](/1sam#1Sam.23.29)). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail ([1 Sam. 25](/1sam#1Sam.25)), whom David married after Nabal’s death.\n\n Saul again went forth ([1 Sam. 26](/1sam#1Sam.26)) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself “in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,” in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.\n\n Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines ([1 Sam. 27](/1sam#1Sam.27)). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.\n\n Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David’s loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul’s death ([2 Sam. 1](/2sam#2Sam.1)). An Amalekite brought Saul’s crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a “lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son” ([2 Sam. 1:18-27](/2sam#2Sam.1.18)). It bore the title of “The Bow,” and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. “Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher” (q.v.).\n\n David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction ([2 Sam. 2:1-4](/2sam#2Sam.2.1)). There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.\n\n But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul’s only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed ([2 Sam. 3:1](/2sam#2Sam.3.1), [5](/2sam#2Sam.3.5)), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon (3:22-39). This was greatly to David’s regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel (4:1-12).\n\n David king over all Israel ([2 Sam. 5:1-5](/2sam#2Sam.5.1); [1 Chr. 11:1-3](/1chr#1Chr.11.1)). The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, “the stronghold”, on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel’s capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.\n\n David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital ([2 Sam. 6](/2sam#2Sam.6)). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home ([1 Sam. 6](/1sam#1Sam.6); [7](/1sam#1Sam.7)). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark, [Num. 4](/num#Num.4)), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. [Ps. 24](/ps#Ps.24). Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now ([1 Chr. 16](/1chr#1Chr.16)) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth “God’s holy hill.”\n\n David’s wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom ([2 Sam. 8](/2sam#2Sam.8)). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway ([2 Sam. 8:3-13](/2sam#2Sam.8.3); [10](/2sam#2Sam.10)).\n\n David’s fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery ([2 Sam. 11:2-27](/2sam#2Sam.11.2)). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros (23:39), was, by his order, “set in the front of the hottest battle” at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet ([2 Sam. 7:1-17](/2sam#2Sam.7.1); [12:1-23](/2sam#2Sam.12.1)) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.\n\n Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah’s death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne ([2 Sam. 12:24](/2sam#2Sam.12.24), [25](/2sam#2Sam.12.25)).\n\n Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message ([2 Sam. 7:1-16](/2sam#2Sam.7.1)). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace ([1 Chr. 22:9](/1chr#1Chr.22.9); [28:3](/1chr#1Chr.28.3)).\n\n A cloudy evening. Hitherto David’s carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime ([2 Sam. 13](/2sam#2Sam.13)). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David’s heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab ([2 Sam. 14](/2sam#2Sam.14)).\n\n After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years’ famine ([2 Sam. 21:1-14](/2sam#2Sam.21.1)). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David’s sinful pride in numbering the people ([2 Sam. 24](/2sam#2Sam.24)), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.\n\n Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom’s chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem ([2 Sam. 15:13-20](/2sam#2Sam.15.13)), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim ([2 Sam. 18:1-8](/2sam#2Sam.18.1)). Absalom’s army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He “went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept” (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, “Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!” Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel (19:41-43). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.\n\n The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David’s life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build ([1 Chr. 22](/1chr#1Chr.22); [28](/1chr#1Chr.28); [29](/1chr#1Chr.29)), a house which was to be “exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries” (22:5). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the “Fuller’s spring,” in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah’s party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father’s throne ([1 Kings 1:11-53](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.11)). David’s last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises ([2 Sam. 23:1-7](/2sam#2Sam.23.1)).\n\n After a reign of forty years and six months ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5); [1 Chr. 3:4](/1chr#1Chr.3.4)) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, “and was buried in the city of David.” His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.\n\n Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah ([1 Sam. 16:13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13)). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the “Psalms of David,” from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection.\n\n “The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all ([2 Sam. 8:15](/2sam#2Sam.8.15)). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5)). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of Solomon was already, before his father’s death, owned from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to the Red Sea.”, Geikie’s Hours etc., iii."],"modified":"2020-12-04T13:53:57.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"reciXDc4qceXoNOhn","fields":{"personLookup":"debir_995","personID":995,"name":"Debir","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recOAQzIL6wGMpbHj"],"displayTitle":"Debir","status":"wip","eastons":["rec9QJCHLYbDoz9P3"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1451,"maxYear":-1451,"alphaGroup":"D","slug":"debir_995","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The king of Eglon, one of the five Canaanitish kings who were hanged by Joshua ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3), [23](/josh#Josh.10.23)) after the victory at Gibeon.

The office remained in his family till the time of Abiathar ([1 Kings 2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26), [27](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.27)), whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (35). He acted also as a civil judge in Israel after the death of Samson ([1 Sam. 4:18](/1sam#1Sam.4.18)), and judged Israel for forty years.\n\n His sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted themselves, to the great disgust of the people ([1 Sam. 2:27-36](/1sam#1Sam.2.27)). They were licentious reprobates. He failed to reprove them so sternly as he ought to have done, and so brought upon his house the judgment of God (2:22-33; 3:18). The Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines, whose army was encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a short way beyond Mizpeh, ended in the total defeat of Israel. Four thousand of them fell in “battle array”. They now sought safety in having the “ark of the covenant of the Lord” among them. They fetched it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas accompanied it. This was the first time since the settlement of Israel in Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary. The Philistines put themselves again in array against Israel, and in the battle which ensued “Israel was smitten, and there was a very great slaughter.” The tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite from the army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the sanctuary by the wayside, anxiously waiting for tidings from the battle-field. The full extent of the national calamity was speedily made known to him: “Israel is fled before the Philistines, there has also been a great slaughter among the people, thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is taken” ([1 Sam. 4:12-18](/1sam#1Sam.4.12)). When the old man, whose eyes were “stiffened” (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye unaffected by the light) with age, heard this sad story of woe, he fell backward from off his seat and died, being ninety and eight years old.\n\n Eli, Heb. eli, “my God”, ([Matt. 27:46](/matt#Matt.27.46)), an exclamation used by Christ on the cross.

There is mention made of a town called Thisbe, south of Kadesh, but it is impossible to say whether this was the place referred to in the name given to the prophet.\n\n Having delivered his message to Ahab, he retired at the command of God to a hiding-place by the brook Cherith, beyond Jordan, where he was fed by ravens. When the brook dried up God sent him to the widow of Zarephath, a city of Zidon, from whose scanty store he was supported for the space of two years. During this period the widow’s son died, and was restored to life by Elijah ([1 Kings 17](/1kgs#1Kgs.17): 2-24).\n\n During all these two years a famine prevailed in the land. At the close of this period of retirement and of preparation for his work (comp. [Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17), [18](/gal#Gal.1.18)) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab’s officers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and bade him go and tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel. It was then proposed that sacrifices should be publicly offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baal or Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with the result that the people fell on their faces, crying, “The Lord, he is the God.” Thus was accomplished the great work of Elijah’s ministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by the order of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediately followed rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer ([James 5:18](/jas#Jas.5.18)).\n\n Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death ([1 Kings 19:1-13](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.1)). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and thence went alone a day’s journey into the wilderness, and sat down in despondency under a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him, and said unto him, “Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.” He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having partaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he went forward on his solitary way for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God, where he took up his abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him and said, “What dost thou here, Elijah?” In answer to his despondent words God manifests to him his glory, and then directs him to return to Damascus and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha to be prophet in his room ([1 Kings 19:13-21](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.13); comp. [2 Kings 8:7-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.7); [9:1-10](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.1)).\n\n Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of the violent deaths they would die ([1 Kings 21:19-24](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19); [22:38](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.38)). He also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had succeeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death ([2 Kings 1:1-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.1)). During these intervals he probably withdrew to some quiet retirement, no one knew where. His interview with Ahaziah’s messengers on the way to Ekron, and the account of the destruction of his captains with their fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement at this time on Mount Carmel.\n\n The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into heaven ([2 Kings 2:1-12](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.1)). He had a presentiment of what was awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the thought of his master’s leaving him, and refused to be parted from him. “They two went on,” and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the Jordan, the waters of which were “divided hither and thither” when smitten with Elijah’s mantle. Arrived at the borders of Gilead, which Elijah had left many years before, it “came to pass as they still went on and talked” they were suddenly separated by a chariot and horses of fire; and “Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, “Elisha receiving his mantle, which fell from him as he ascended.\n\n No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in the New Testament. The priests and Levites said to the Baptist ([John 1:25](/john#John.1.25)), “Why baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias?” Paul ([Rom. 11:2](/rom#Rom.11.2)) refers to an incident in his history to illustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people. James (5:17) finds in him an illustration of the power of prayer. (See also [Luke 4:25](/luke#Luke.4.25); [9:54](/luke#Luke.9.54).) He was a type of John the Baptist in the sternness and power of his reproofs ([Luke 9:8](/luke#Luke.9.8)). He was the Elijah that “must first come” ([Matt. 11:11](/matt#Matt.11.11), [14](/matt#Matt.11.14)), the forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly the Baptist corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that he might be styled a second Elijah. In him we see “the same connection with a wild and wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert; the same sudden, startling entrance on his work ([1 Kings 17:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.17.1); [Luke 3:2](/luke#Luke.3.2)); even the same dress, a hairy garment, and a leathern girdle about the loins ([2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8); [Matt. 3:4](/matt#Matt.3.4)).”\n\n How deep the impression was which Elijah made “on the mind of the nation may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested on the words of Malachi (4:5, 6), which many centuries after prevailed that he would again appear for the relief and restoration of the country.

His name first occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor ([1 Kings 19:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.16)). This was the only one of the three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (comp. [Luke 9:61](/luke#Luke.9.61), [62](/luke#Luke.9.62)). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah’s life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, “a double portion” of Elijah’s spirit ([2 Kings 2:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.9)); and for the long period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office of “prophet in Israel” ([2 Kings 5:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.5.8)).\n\n After Elijah’s departure, Elisha returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into it ([2 Kings 2:21](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.21)). We next find him at Bethel (2:23), where, with the sternness of his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God: “Go up, thou bald head.” The judgment at once took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as dishonour done to himself. We next read of his predicting a fall of rain when the army of Jehoram was faint from thirst ([2 Kings 3:9-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.9)); of the multiplying of the poor widow’s cruse of oil (4:1-7); the miracle of restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (4:18-37); the multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into a sufficient supply for an hundred men (4:42-44); of the cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy (5:1-27); of the punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his covetousness; of the recovery of the axe lost in the waters of the Jordan (6:1-7); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way on the road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of Samaria by the king of Syria, and of the terrible sufferings of the people in connection with it, and Elisha’s prophecy as to the relief that would come ([2 Kings 6:24-7:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.24)).\n\n We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria ([2 Kings 8:7-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.7)); thereafter he directs one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel, instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to Elijah (9:1-10) were at length carried out.\n\n We do not again read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house ([2 Kings 13:14-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.14)).

The name of Edom, “red”, was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil “pottage” for which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a “son of the desert,” devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing ([Gen. 27:28](/gen#Gen.27.28), [29](/gen#Gen.27.29), [36](/gen#Gen.27.36); [Heb. 12:16](/heb#Heb.12.16), [17](/heb#Heb.12.17)). He afterwards tried to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother ([Gen. 27:4](/gen#Gen.27.4), [34](/gen#Gen.27.34), [38](/gen#Gen.27.38)).\n\n At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his parents, he married ([Gen. 26:34](/gen#Gen.26.34), [35](/gen#Gen.26.35)) two Canaanitish maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram, Esau tried to conciliate his parents ([Gen. 28:8](/gen#Gen.28.8), [9](/gen#Gen.28.9)) by marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years’ sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him (33:4). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave (35:29). Esau now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).\n\n Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against Israel."],"modified":"2020-09-11T12:42:56.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rechVIzbtG8RyGHIk","fields":{"personLookup":"eshban_1217","personID":1217,"name":"Eshban","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec5qyCXE7a38fUX0","recyfhUwJtYwEA4TP"],"siblings":["Ithran(no entry)","Cheran(no entry)","Hemdan(no entry)"],"father":["Dishon(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Eshban","status":"wip","verseCount":2,"minYear":-1853,"maxYear":-1756,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"eshban_1217","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec9xUjJh4H6OZ18O","fields":{"personLookup":"eshcol_1218","personID":1218,"name":"Eshcol","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recnwtoQVgmyzMCfa","recpDuZPV0EDvaVKB"],"siblings":["Aner 1","Mamre 1"],"displayTitle":"Eshcol","status":"publish","eastons":["recMF0EnMoa6gn6Ly"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-1913,"maxYear":-1913,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"eshcol_1218","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A young Amoritish chief who joined Abraham in the recovery of Lot from the hands of Chedorlaomer ([Gen. 14:13](/gen#Gen.14.13), [24](/gen#Gen.14.24))."],"modified":"2020-07-16T16:31:53.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recKgvujRpZyFRKIK","fields":{"personLookup":"eshtemoa_1219","personID":1219,"name":"Eshtemoa","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recu3iIFpU9Zrsf0Y"],"siblings":["Garmite(no entry)"],"halfSiblingsSameFather":["Ishbah(no entry)","Miriam 2","Shammai(no entry)"],"mother":["Hodiah(no entry)"],"father":["Mered"],"displayTitle":"Eshtemoa","status":"wip","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1721,"maxYear":-1721,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"eshtemoa_1219","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recZcNJkfVAQGvOUw","fields":{"personLookup":"eshton_1220","personID":1220,"name":"Eshton","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recq0YE282lcATloJ","recC7idtekE50NRfe"],"father":["Mehir(no entry)"],"children":["Beth-rapha(no entry)","Tehinnah(no entry)","Paseah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Eshton","status":"wip","verseCount":2,"minYear":-1721,"maxYear":-1721,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"eshton_1220","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recHeMSbcjy38laMS","fields":{"personLookup":"esli_1221","personID":1221,"name":"Esli","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"verses":["rec05AHSUZu0iYRWZ"],"father":["Nagge(no entry)"],"children":["Naum(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Esli","status":"wip","verseCount":1,"minYear":26,"maxYear":26,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"esli_1221","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recRuSINUX52qGLlh","fields":{"personLookup":"esther_1343","personID":1343,"name":"Esther","isProperName":true,"gender":"Female","verses":["rec8y5FpAvSmgYIcx","recoowe1IVGWPdLzr","recBIXyoeTzv6CzQW","recjvSIhfciGxE9at","rec0oVoLJmKKJO6un","recH2eIsTWfQaLP7v","recNslhJQEuHohLFm","recYgnQyOTA9E9m8R","recVHS7vWYezcVLWw","recvfSZxzXzUKvQNs","reczkQ0kMiIBjJ66u","recR19Rn7lWdvCVXM","recfJDpxVi5cSwdHA","recL1ScDTis198LD5","recqZkRQMoU07eN44","rectqZFyM8AOroL0w","recN70GqztYKUwc8J","recyWNgygXO2jWI7q","rectaxU4sl2Mw8CNq","recNrLOHRJu2PTrJD","rec9hlgfYy54Q5LUW","rec74uCz9evPNc7En","recVWmUdJQfH2UZkr","recn90y0y8gCdTSyv","receouAtmQCa5apbh","recFVgBB5OFE4UN3E","recxT7rmnNs1KhTXa","recOw3KuVyRWHGCsJ","recUYSxKEmR56W91U","recnQTB6vsUy4Ay33","recnXjwp6b69okiUJ","rec0xKIIraY3IteBv","rec5riSfeRIP1tc7r","recVR6LdhqeAGRzgS","recha79ODIXfx7Vij","recZQcRdDmSrawnEB","recYXXSYOBOCQvCas","recS7zQxWx0WwLFwV","reciOt7bSitQEzLHj","recH7G9FxiPL6zPVH","recLhu97YHsd5BxtY","rec0JaguVYis6E4Gc","recycmi1hFuVMgHmR","rec8geDBs8revkZsl","recJ2Xjo45Q1GYWRS","rec5WSh2GJhBRkoOD"],"father":["Abihail 5"],"displayTitle":"Esther","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Hadassah","eastons":["recYRWZAkSrdQvoyM"],"verseCount":46,"minYear":-461,"maxYear":-452,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"esther_1343","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The queen of Ahasuerus, and heroine of the book that bears her name. She was a Jewess named Hadas’sah (the myrtle), but when she entered the royal harem she received the name by which she henceforth became known ([Esther 2:7](/esth#Esth.2.7)). It is a Syro-Arabian modification of the Persian word satarah, which means a star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her family did not avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to the exiles to return to Jerusalem; and she resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king at “Shushan in the palace.” Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose Esther to be his wife. Soon after this he gave Haman the Agagite, his prime minister, power and authority to kill and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian empire. By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe was averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had intended for Mordecai ([Esther 7](/esth#Esth.7)); and the Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of their wonderful deliverance. This took place about fifty-two years after the Return, the year of the great battles of Plataea and Mycale (B.C. 479).\n\n Esther appears in the Bible as a “woman of deep piety, faith, courage, patriotism, and caution, combined with resolution; a dutiful daughter to her adopted father, docile and obedient to his counsels, and anxious to share the king’s favour with him for the good of the Jewish people. There must have been a singular grace and charm in her aspect and manners, since ‘she obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her’ ([Esther 2:15](/esth#Esth.2.15)). That she was raised up as an instrument in the hand of God to avert the destruction of the Jewish people, and to afford them protection and forward their wealth and peace in their captivity, is also manifest from the Scripture account.”"],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recBm9uwlLPBAZOb5","fields":{"personLookup":"ethan_1222","personID":1222,"name":"Ethan","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recGXNNFKjkEyBIqT"],"siblings":["Chalcol(no entry)","Darda","Heman 1"],"chaptersWritten":["reclVA1cbLK4WauLF"],"father":["Mahol"],"displayTitle":"Ethan","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Ethan (the Ezrahite)","eastons":["rec71RjVSjJNjEDZB"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1014,"maxYear":-1014,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"ethan_1222","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["“The Ezrahite,” distinguished for his wisdom ([1 Kings 4:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.31)).

The account of her creation is given in [Gen. 2:21](/gen#Gen.2.21), [22](/gen#Gen.2.22). The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy. The commentator Matthew Henry says: “This companion was taken from his side to signify that she was to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of equality which is to subsist in the marriage state.” And again, “That wife that is of God’s making by special grace, and of God’s bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a helpmeet to her husband.” Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also unto her husband ([1 Tim. 2:13-15](/1tim#1Tim.2.13); [2 Cor. 11:3](/2cor#2Cor.11.3)).

He was the son, or perhaps grandson, of Seraiah ([2 Kings 25:18-21](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.18)), and a lineal descendant of Phinehas, the son of Aaron ([Ezra 7:1-5](/ezra#Ezra.7.1)). All we know of his personal history is contained in the last four chapters of his book, and in [Neh. 8](/neh#Neh.8) and 12:26.\n\n In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (see DARIUS), he obtained leave to go up to Jerusalem and to take with him a company of Israelites ([Ezra 8](/ezra#Ezra.8)). Artaxerxes manifested great interest in Ezra’s undertaking, granting him “all his request,” and loading him with gifts for the house of God. Ezra assembled the band of exiles, probably about 5,000 in all, who were prepared to go up with him to Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava, where they rested for three days, and were put into order for their march across the desert, which was completed in four months. His proceedings at Jerusalem on his arrival there are recorded in his book.\n\n He was “a ready scribe in the law of Moses,” who “had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.” “He is,” says Professor Binnie, “the first well-defined example of an order of men who have never since ceased in the church; men of sacred erudition, who devote their lives to the study of the Holy Scriptures, in order that they may be in a condition to interpret them for the instruction and edification of the church. It is significant that the earliest mention of the pulpit occurs in the history of Ezra’s ministry ([Neh. 8:4](/neh#Neh.8.4)). He was much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn from the account of his labours in the book of Nehemiah that he was careful to have the whole people instructed in the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject the constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with the collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The final completion of the canon may have been, and probably was, the work of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have put it much into the shape in which it is still found in the Hebrew Bible. When it is added that the complete organization of the synagogue dates from this period, it will be seen that the age was emphatically one of Biblical study” (The Psalms: their History, etc.).\n\n For about fourteen years, i.e., till B.C. 445, we have no record of what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set in order the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation. In that year another distinguished personage, Nehemiah, appears on the scene. After the ruined wall of the city had been built by Nehemiah, there was a great gathering of the people at Jerusalem preparatory to the dedication of the wall. On the appointed day the whole population assembled, and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his assistants ([Neh. 8:3](/neh#Neh.8.3)). The remarkable scene is described in detail. There was a great religious awakening. For successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessing their sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant to be the Lord’s. Abuses were rectified, and arrangements for the temple service completed, and now nothing remained but the dedication of the walls of the city ([Neh. 12](/neh#Neh.12))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec0U7oGAiaNNmtyG","fields":{"personLookup":"ezra_1246","personID":1246,"name":"Ezra","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recNnOLpVTwjL3q34","reckj9PUvtRJ6GNWQ","recpD9VKzq5HiMwut"],"displayTitle":"Ezra","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Ezra the priest","eastons":["recZpOvIlQu1mKEhy"],"verseCount":3,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"ezra_1246","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A priest among those that returned to Jerusalem under Zerubabel ([Neh. 12:1](/neh#Neh.12.1))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recrP89ou8B9eXQgf","fields":{"personLookup":"ezri_1247","personID":1247,"name":"Ezri","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recC7ZyXs1foazyYA"],"father":["Chelub(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Ezri","status":"wip","eastons":["recJYJ2tfKnr3AsGI"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1015,"maxYear":-1015,"alphaGroup":"E","slug":"ezri_1247","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Help of Jehovah, the son of Chelub.

He appears to have expected a bribe from Paul, and therefore had several interviews with him. The \"worthy deeds\" referred to in   24:2   was his clearing the country of banditti and impostors.    At the end of a two years' term, Porcius Festus was appointed in the room of Felix (A.D. 60), who proceeded to Rome, and was there accused of cruelty and malversation of office by the Jews of Caesarea. The accusation was rendered nugatory by the influence of his brother Pallas with Nero. (See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8,9.)

His calling is the commencement of the second period in the history of the judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the Midianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other “children of the east,” crossed the Jordan each year for seven successive years for the purpose of plundering and desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from God to undertake the task of delivering the land from these warlike invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer ([Josh. 17:2](/josh#Josh.17.2); [1 Chr. 7:18](/1chr#1Chr.7.18)), and of the little township of Ophrah ([Judg. 6:11](/judg#Judg.6.11)). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, “For the Lord and for Gideon” ([Judg. 7:18](/judg#Judg.7.18), R.V.). Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation ([1 Sam. 12:11](/1sam#1Sam.12.11); [Ps. 83:11](/ps#Ps.83.11); [Isa. 9:4](/isa#Isa.9.4); [10:26](/isa#Isa.10.26); [Heb. 11:32](/heb#Heb.11.32)). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, “neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal” ([Judg. 8:35](/judg#Judg.8.35)). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who slaughtered all Gideon’s sons, except Jotham, upon one stone."],"modified":"2020-09-13T02:16:12.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recXUw8sDi98VMhji","fields":{"personLookup":"gideoni_1315","personID":1315,"name":"Gideoni","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rect09F8F9PNfoaE1","recezuM9D0tDW77r9","rec6L7TEDd4exdMYS","recYRSjLbnwUW2QLT","rec1H1Qlu3DRNvlxW"],"children":["Abidan"],"displayTitle":"Gideoni","status":"wip","verseCount":5,"minYear":-1490,"maxYear":-1490,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"gideoni_1315","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rect6Q3zh4mPDUDD1","fields":{"personLookup":"gilalai_1316","personID":1316,"name":"Gilalai","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec09hqb5fudlT0VT"],"siblings":["Azarael(no entry)","Hanani(no entry)","Judah(no entry)","Maai(no entry)","Milaiai","Nethaneel 10","Shemaiah(no entry)","Zechariah(no entry)"],"father":["Jonathan(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Gilalai","status":"wip","verseCount":1,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"gilalai_1316","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recxCpuPqJTTZalKd","fields":{"personLookup":"gilead_1317","personID":1317,"name":"Gilead","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["rec4hpOWgtnNNXWSJ"],"verses":["rec0pvedDmb9GdaaS","recno8b3ZqT0FwJBv","recCle7p5vNxS1JM1","rec8vAskrDiIjh3E5","rec0dVHAJlGfrsF2N","rec0f5iZZkegGBCfq","recDZdCSGBUlRMqxB","rec52AndrmRoUhS7y","recrJHJlJAK53GryA","recToYYWqIHwytSA9","recb1RLyaeZf6nbO1"],"siblings":["Daughter of Machir(no entry)","Hammoleketh","Peresh(no entry)","Sheresh"],"father":["Machir 1"],"children":["Helek","Hepher 2","Shechem 2","Shemida(no entry)","Abieezer 1","Asriel(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Gilead","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Gilead(son of Manasseh)","verseCount":11,"minYear":-1470,"maxYear":-1443,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"gilead_1317","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2020-07-10T12:52:04.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recw9IZgnva9BwfQJ","fields":{"personLookup":"gilead_1318","personID":1318,"name":"Gilead","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recCXI8A1RsNwCyuw"],"children":["Jephthah"],"displayTitle":"Gilead","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Gileadite","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Gilead (Father of Jephthah the Gileadite)","verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"gilead_1318","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recjDAnWexDv5EDg6","fields":{"personLookup":"gilead_1319","personID":1319,"name":"Gilead","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recN4UwyWERSjMfbc"],"father":["Michael(no entry)"],"children":["Jaroah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Gilead","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Gilead(Michael)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1060,"maxYear":-1060,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"gilead_1319","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec8CpdJgloDWtEqM","fields":{"personLookup":"ginath_1320","personID":1320,"name":"Ginath","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recB2Fa73z6iDstq4","rec0ctTosDNT9WJ6z"],"children":["Tibni"],"displayTitle":"Ginath","status":"wip","verseCount":2,"minYear":-929,"maxYear":-929,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"ginath_1320","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec4hZFk7z6mmKEfQ","fields":{"personLookup":"ginnethon_1321","personID":1321,"name":"Ginnethon","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recdzDbqhec2jgCBG","recLtZlrhNu7E2Q4S","rec2rcQSgb0GVYqt6"],"displayTitle":"Ginnethon","status":"wip","verseCount":3,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"ginnethon_1321","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec4l7RDJjVHkcR4T","fields":{"personLookup":"girgasite_1322","personID":1322,"name":"Girgasite","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recGXnbg59sffEj7f","recIHGRM9SuInMAdi"],"siblings":["Amorites","Arkite","Arvadite(no entry)","Jebusites","Hamathite(no entry)","Heth","Hivites","Zidon","Sinite","Zemarite"],"father":["Canaan 1"],"displayTitle":"Girgasite","status":"publish","alsoCalled":"Girgashite","eastons":["rec3khs6jhmUW1AL0"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-2304,"maxYear":-2304,"alphaGroup":"G","slug":"girgasite_1322","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Dwelling in clayey soil, the descendants of the fifth son of Canaan ([Gen. 10:16](/gen#Gen.10.16)), one of the original tribes inhabiting the land of Canaan before the time of the Israelites ([Gen. 15:21](/gen#Gen.15.21); [Deut. 7:1](/deut#Deut.7.1)).

Gud; Ger. Gott), the name of the Divine Being. It is the rendering (1) of the Hebrew <i> 'El</i> , from a word meaning to be strong; (2) of <i> 'Eloah_, plural _'Elohim</i> . The singular form, <i> Eloah</i> , is used only in poetry. The plural form is more commonly used in all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.), the only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme Being, is uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by \"LORD,\" printed in small capitals. The existence of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There is nowhere any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is spoken of as one devoid of understanding (  Psalms 14:1  ).    The arguments generally adduced by theologians in proof of the being of God are:   <li> The a priori argument, which is the testimony afforded by reason.    <li> The a posteriori argument, by which we proceed logically from the facts of experience to causes. These arguments are,    (a) The cosmological, by which it is proved that there must be a First Cause of all things, for every effect must have a cause.   (b) The teleological, or the argument from design. We see everywhere the operations of an intelligent Cause in nature.   (c) The moral argument, called also the anthropological argument, based on the moral consciousness and the history of mankind, which exhibits a moral order and purpose which can only be explained on the supposition of the existence of God. Conscience and human history testify that \"verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.\"   The attributes of God are set forth in order by Moses in   Exodus 34:6   Exodus 34:7  . (see also   Deuteronomy 6:4  ;   10:17  ;   Numbers 16:22  ;   Exodus 15:11  ;   33:19  ;   Isaiah 44:6  ;   Habakkuk 3:6  ;   Psalms 102:26  ;   Job 34:12  .) They are also systematically classified in   Revelation 5:12   and   7:12  .    God's attributes are spoken of by some as absolute, i.e., such as belong to his essence as Jehovah, Jah, etc.; and relative, i.e., such as are ascribed to him with relation to his creatures. Others distinguish them into communicable, i.e., those which can be imparted in degree to his creatures: goodness, holiness, wisdom, etc.; and incommunicable, which cannot be so imparted: independence, immutability, immensity, and eternity.

Gud; Ger. Gott), the name of the Divine Being. It is the rendering (1) of the Hebrew ’El, from a word meaning to be strong; (2) of ’Eloah_, plural _’Elohim. The singular form, Eloah, is used only in poetry.

Scarcely anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began his ministry about sixteen years after the Return. The work of rebuilding the temple had been put a stop to through the intrigues of the Samaritans. After having been suspended for fifteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zechariah ([Ezra 6:14](/ezra#Ezra.6.14)), who by their exhortations roused the people from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of the favourable opportunity that had arisen in a change in the policy of the Persian government.

[2](/1sam#1Sam.2)). Her home was at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she was wont every year to go to Shiloh, where the tabernacle had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering of sacrifices there according to the law ([Ex. 23:15](/exod#Exod.23.15); [34:18](/exod#Exod.34.18); [Deut. 16:16](/deut#Deut.16.16)), probably at the feast of the Passover (comp. [Ex. 13:10](/exod#Exod.13.10)). On occasion of one of these “yearly” visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah’s conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct ([1 Sam. 1:14-16](/1sam#1Sam.1.14)). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, “Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition.” Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord’s goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., “heard of God.” After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, “Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord” ([1 Sam. 1:27](/1sam#1Sam.1.27), [28](/1sam#1Sam.1.28), R.V.). Her gladness of heart then found vent in that remarkable prophetic song (2:1-10; comp. [Luke 1:46-55](/luke#Luke.1.46)) which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name ([1 Sam. 2:10](/1sam#1Sam.2.10), “Annointed” = “Messiah”). And so Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister “before the Lord.” And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to her absent child “a little coat” (Heb. meil, a term used to denote the “robe” of the ephod worn by the high priest, [Ex. 28:31](/exod#Exod.28.31)), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic ([1 Chr. 15:27](/1chr#1Chr.15.27)), in which to minister in the tabernacle ([1 Sam. 2:19](/1sam#1Sam.2.19); [15:27](/1sam#1Sam.15.27); [Job 2:12](/job#Job.2.12)). “And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.” After Samuel, Hannah had three sons and two daughters."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recdxN9u3Vw1s73kg","fields":{"personLookup":"hanniel_1401","personID":1401,"name":"Hanniel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recKN3QF7EnZ3eKCA"],"father":["Ephod(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Hanniel","status":"wip","eastons":["recUfLbU018KzdqfP"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1452,"maxYear":-1452,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hanniel_1401","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A chief of the tribe of Manasseh ([Num. 34:23](/num#Num.34.23))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec7AvqLWfSYNkmb1","fields":{"personLookup":"hanoch_1403","personID":1403,"name":"Hanoch","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recwaeE7xPtLQrgEJ"],"verses":["recnBcxOQNDamBK9c","recWYXhX9zE1PQW31","recNFAelmfN6ZiAi1","recTfz8GakLDb2XVz"],"siblings":["Carmi 1","Hezron 1","Pallu"],"father":["Reuben"],"displayTitle":"Hanoch","status":"wip","verseCount":4,"minYear":-1710,"maxYear":-1452,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hanoch_1403","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recuOQR11wtpYOqVr","fields":{"personLookup":"hanun_1404","personID":1404,"name":"Hanun","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recvH80r0Z2Iiqk3i","recwwL3myQ2lolE5e","recjiMMfBS1vrir2w","recilq6z1vzBAm4q0","recS69wC71TlAZTbE","rec6AhTYE757V4QiH","recmC5YE3DvBZop7w","rec6GEaIg7A0YhUec"],"father":["Nahash(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Hanun","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"A son and successor of Nahash, king of Ammon.

He reigned twenty-nine years (B.C. 726-697). The history of this king is contained in [2 Kings 18:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.20), [Isa. 36](/isa#Isa.36)-39, and [2 Chr. 29](/2chr#2Chr.29)-32. He is spoken of as a great and good king. In public life he followed the example of his great-granfather Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the “brazen serpent,” which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of idolatrous worship ([Num. 21:9](/num#Num.21.9)). A great reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day ([2 Kings 18:4](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.4); [2 Chr. 29:3-36](/2chr#2Chr.29.3)).\n\n On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and “rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not,” but entered into a league with Egypt ([Isa. 30](/isa#Isa.30); [31](/isa#Isa.31); [36:6-9](/isa#Isa.36.6)). This led to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib ([2 Kings 18:13-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13)), who took forty cities, and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold (18:14).\n\n But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah ([Isa. 33:1](/isa#Isa.33.1)), and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17); [2 Chr. 32:9](/2chr#2Chr.32.9); [Isa. 36](/isa#Isa.36)). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib’s army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and “that night the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men.” Sennacherib fled with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer ([2 Kings 19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37)).\n\n The narrative of Hezekiah’s sickness and miraculous recovery is found in [2 Kings 20:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.1), [2](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.2) Chr. 32:24, [Isa. 38:1](/isa#Isa.38.1). Various ambassadors came to congratulate him on his recovery, and among them Merodach-baladan, the viceroy of Babylon ([2 Chr. 32:23](/2chr#2Chr.32.23); [2 Kings 20:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.12)). He closed his days in peace and prosperity, and was succeeded by his son Manasseh. He was buried in the “chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David” ([2 Chr. 32:27-33](/2chr#2Chr.32.27)). He had “after him none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him” ([2 Kings 18:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.5))."],"modified":"2020-12-03T13:43:29.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recuMPLaQzYtlS89l","fields":{"personLookup":"hezekiah_1513","personID":1513,"name":"Hezekiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E"],"verses":["recQTklg5Oc6bmvNT"],"siblings":["Azrikam(no entry)","Elioenai(no entry)"],"father":["Neariah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Hezekiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Hezekiah (King of Judah)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1053,"maxYear":-1053,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hezekiah_1513","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recGM7LTCD8kEDGz2","fields":{"personLookup":"hezekiah_1514","personID":1514,"name":"Hezekiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recUKqO16OXVbkFhx","rec0dca2fS2iFjkYP"],"father":["Ater 1"],"displayTitle":"Hezekiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Hezekiah (exile) Hezekiah ( Babylon)","verseCount":2,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hezekiah_1514","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recnPnBVen7jE5KQp","fields":{"personLookup":"hezion_1515","personID":1515,"name":"Hezion","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recfPtzYTz1djiIo5"],"children":["Tabrimon"],"displayTitle":"Hezion","status":"wip","eastons":["rec6UpD4trZdRqKJ4"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-930,"maxYear":-930,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hezion_1515","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Vision, the father of Tabrimon, and grandfather of Ben-hadad, king of Syria ([1 Kings 15:18](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.18))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recDqcWdcN8iEcwxX","fields":{"personLookup":"hezir_1516","personID":1516,"name":"Hezir","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec5IXDdW63ohdMgJ"],"displayTitle":"Hezir","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"not found","eastons":["recvNM3MpBHsn7QpE"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1015,"maxYear":-1015,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hezir_1516","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The head of the seventeenth course of the priests ([1 Chr. 24:15](/1chr#1Chr.24.15))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recWtJo8GZz2jbh1t","fields":{"personLookup":"hezir_1517","personID":1517,"name":"Hezir","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recZCcI7sCmgGXBRz"],"displayTitle":"Hezir","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Hezir (leader )","eastons":["recmMsRQ1WhfCeuCR"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hezir_1517","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["[Neh. 10:20](/neh#Neh.10.20), one who sealed Nehemiah’s covenant."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec3YxEGhZrEbJZaF","fields":{"personLookup":"hezrai_1518","personID":1518,"name":"Hezrai","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rece0I02cP0nNk73q","rec6bYeIt2QZ2vHov"],"displayTitle":"Hezrai","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Hezro","eastons":["reclKa4TBNdH9BTXr"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-1055,"maxYear":-1055,"alphaGroup":"H","slug":"hezrai_1518","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A Carmelite, one of David’s warriors ([1 Chr. 11:37](/1chr#1Chr.11.37))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recGyiKSySYMve0Cx","fields":{"personLookup":"hezron_1519","personID":1519,"name":"Hezron","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recwaeE7xPtLQrgEJ"],"verses":["recnBcxOQNDamBK9c","recWYXhX9zE1PQW31","recwlPFNx1Luuv6as","recJDTCyjkYTfeHmW","recTfz8GakLDb2XVz"],"siblings":["Carmi 1","Hanoch(no entry)","Pallu"],"father":["Reuben"],"displayTitle":"Hezron","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Hezron (The tribe of Reuben descended from Reuben and his four sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

(1) Israel, or the kingdom of the ten tribes (  Amos 7:9   Amos 7:16  ).    The only son of Abraham by Sarah. He was the longest lived of the three patriarchs (  Genesis 21:1-3  ). He was circumcised when eight days old (4-7); and when he was probably two years old a great feast was held in connection with his being weaned.    The next memorable event in his life is that connected with the command of God given to Abraham to offer him up as a sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah (  Genesis 22  ). (See  ABRAHAM  .) When he was forty years of age Rebekah was chosen for his wife (  Genesis 24  ). After the death and burial of his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi (  25:7-11  ), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were born (21-26), the former of whom seems to have been his favourite son (27,28).    In consequence of a famine (  Genesis 26:1  ) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt (  12:12-20  ) and in Gerar (  20:2  ). The Philistine king rebuked him for his prevarication.    After sojourning for some time in the land of the Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a covenant of peace with him.   The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his sons (  Genesis 27:1  ). He died at Mamre, \"being old and full of days\" (  35:27-29  ), one hundred and eighty years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.    In the New Testament reference is made to his having been \"offered up\" by his father (  Hebrews 11:17  ;   James 2:21  ), and to his blessing his sons (  Hebrews 11:20  ). As the child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael (  Romans 9:7   Romans 9:10  ;   Galatians 4:28  ;   Hebrews 11:18  ).    Isaac is \"at once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah's tent, moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to her strong, loving will.\" His life was so quiet and uneventful that it was spent \"within the circle of a few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother's death was the poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his life at his father's disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to his race.\", Geikie's Hours, etc.","verses":["recKDy5LAROnbzxhT","recQh2n29BfSq0Gep","rec4WtInoU8l3ejHx","rec8QmwqEArrc0Hag","rectjJHX5XP2Qd7DE","recImVZhtgmF1xDrp","recyqvWYr7Fe0s0YC","recvSNRZXOe6gmOzj","recIChWFVt96TgBPk","rec7SbMmT3Bu03r7B","reccRCJkEoVCMyCI0","recKVfiKYcuQQ05T1","recy1VOrAMuRuE2rC","recs1rvDbfp8xyYpb","recXq4paOjN0dZPmN","recuGySRuKwjMvfa0","recL2WVG9ojPaYmph","recmovM6GDMXWnLlv","recUTm3jz9ySIUUjD","recIClGIARl4nXxKm","recpbybp2PfpNnxLm","recPwtsljxiFCSFKO","rec4UNf1YyzBuC4Z0","recm7R7lvRF7ofNlt","recTcjbCxYrmypGEI","recVuwRiQHi5hwRca","recq3JBxbAFFkEwOz","recF0awhZCSb06TMf","recyHLff3vm8tg5Rn","recFlMDSrdSOh9Yez","recEOEbZRLpLe1wVA","recCql1Rug3srs32H","recygcioLZipTtmrq","recHzy6AK2b9WZQDm","recd3thLPTCrfpzgR","recXjSHKMNMKhDDKY","recQqgIEfdUh7aZVZ","recKERBZ21doFW4TF","recc61hwAMSLHLmpu","recO4tmJJ7hdS373C","recEk4Nxuj2S31ugV","recdXTbwp9iyRjfHa","recFZYOeb8X9pyBZE","recJm3VY7ct1oYvLL","recHJOmttNEALnZYW","recpmIliRIDAGJb4s","recCHkgMIjWBuGgV7","recXA98rUThTuTC5I","recqM62EFlPkmIwh1","recQKmrVfFMyagoWK","reckjJdV63B1r0Xpp","recNqNM9hzGu3pWQe","recEPkYKuec4WqMKI","recJH0EIq8PMcAxXs","rec5w84Oec56QA5Zo","recz94C9YD3xqVseS","rectkI9Gw79rvd7ip","recigZGGkyDqQ93sl","recMTZ7jFllU6gZwy","recWPT5hO9rWHSfDr","recIjc6zZvznjmGNz","rec4N0juR5Dr5xE9D","recTPDwxRj5yrzH33","recXYUI67uaBtwK8i","recVuKIX2d9MGjskH","reccTLg8GOCVP3EQd","recJxTWLBjFxqFULi","recHLssPX4MYQJvBM","recTizuonPLPoXzQK","recaDA8ZgBrTdG4KR","recPXnvrcSBrPWnqW","recolTQuknVYxuNnX","recYxdwuRXqtkpsgO","rece0JkE5NxZHiVdW","recqRNHrMuOTUtiyv","recuKdy92MLDv5bdf","recHMB3YcnDnPodZb","reczbFm7AhSKbUBc7","recURqPKrHTWA9fFQ","recX7E5Yz7fl7bLRc","recnU5O25pWd2nJcE","receqWXg4BrXNJEyV","rec7PncKMUP0vBN6G","recBobsQ88siJjIJ6","recDJ27QnzFJV8vwv","receGypmap55DKl62","recnKZROTFYtklCn0","rec1xvxm1yirae0oj","recQLjoumQH31qpKi","recr04gIN2TjjiEV8","rechpqRvcWXpDEF9T","recfJRFadgMjovTna","recvsFijaPX99FIfD","recDvhkJ1ljDe9iTt","recBrZxHPGPNfrCGp","recwUSezzj2QFQAQR","recgxJc9pzswqvFRt","recNHjwf6WC9kMyQX","recoglCd5inbUnwMN","rec8VQwAqVoJjv2fJ","recj0zMMQEdDlu9Cp","recivpzeOhyssQFcQ","reca3bckeyXem8DKs","recrofmQMyFGYVPRh","recD0BqqWgU3kfMmq","recrY5j3W5NyR8pbB","recoF4CamOGfgkWdQ","reczuxqda8N5bNStU","recWEU4gAFt4g59sG","reciWYzBchVGAfrsR","rec3F0lsmm8SmkYbd","recyshTTuzGicdbWw","recZWqdn2qi7LAsjY","recoHjw75mrm2EYPv","recAhCFnI3HU4w6ER","rechRZKGYhYMFqlql","recQdMKhmYMMovI8a","recSZQHTM2MB7KQCs","rec1tyhPJ8blq9VMM","recFZk2LyA12n5Xut","recapVliNROFwR6IQ","recnfbx6ojBCbb8Ql","recLBrNWb30JxW1z5"],"halfSiblingsSameFather":["Ishbak","Ishmael 1","Jokshan","Dedan 2","Midian","Shuah 1","Zimran"],"mother":["Sarah"],"father":["Abraham"],"children":["Esau","Jacob"],"displayTitle":"Isaac","status":"publish","partners":["Rebekah"],"eastons":["rec78MHu2L6oVYLIx"],"timeline":["recsPU7EMhmA9z27x","recMAoYK2dHmjhRh9","recnTimjDqmxMYqRZ","recd4mOzI2nL66vR5","recSDGDMwUBAMUgur"],"verseCount":123,"minYear":-1897,"maxYear":64,"alphaGroup":"I","slug":"isaac_616","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The only son of Abraham by Sarah.

After the death and burial of his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi (25:7-11), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were born (21-26), the former of whom seems to have been his favourite son (27, 28).\n\n In consequence of a famine ([Gen. 26:1](/gen#Gen.26.1)) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt (12:12-20) and in Gerar (20:2). The Philistine king rebuked him for his prevarication.\n\n After sojourning for some time in the land of the Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a covenant of peace with him.\n\n The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his sons ([Gen. 27:1](/gen#Gen.27.1)). He died at Mamre, “being old and full of days” (35:27-29), one hundred and eighty years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.\n\n In the New Testament reference is made to his having been “offered up” by his father ([Heb. 11:17](/heb#Heb.11.17); [James 2:21](/jas#Jas.2.21)), and to his blessing his sons ([Heb. 11:20](/heb#Heb.11.20)). As the child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael ([Rom. 9:7](/rom#Rom.9.7), [10](/rom#Rom.9.10); [Gal. 4:28](/gal#Gal.4.28); [Heb. 11:18](/heb#Heb.11.18)).\n\n Isaac is “at once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah’s tent, moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to her strong, loving will.” His life was so quiet and uneventful that it was spent “within the circle of a few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother’s death was the poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his life at his father’s disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to his race.”, Geikie’s Hours, etc."],"modified":"2020-09-07T19:05:16.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recit3DiamFt2zO0S","fields":{"personLookup":"isaiah_617","personID":617,"name":"Isaiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","dictionaryLink":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/isaiah.html","dictionaryText":" (Heb. Yesh'yahu, i.e., \"the salvation of Jehovah\"). The son of Amoz (  Isaiah 1:1  ;   2:1  ), who was apparently a man of humble rank. His wife was called \"the prophetess\" (  8:3  ), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah (Judg.   4:4  ) and Huldah (  2�Kings 22:14-20  ), or simply because she was the wife of \"the prophet\" (  Isaiah 38:1  ). He had two sons, who bore symbolical names.    He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (  1:1  ). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah's death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.    His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him \"in the year that King Uzziah died\" (  Isaiah 6:1  ). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward \"the holy One of Israel.\"    In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.),   2�Kings 15:19  ; and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria (  2�Kings 16:5  ;   2  Chr.  2 Kings 28:5  2 Kings 28:6 ). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria (  2�Kings 15:29  ;   16:9  ;   1�Chronicles 5:26  ). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who \"rebelled against the king of Assyria\" (  2�Kings 18:7  ), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah (  Isaiah 10:24  ;   37:6  ), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt (  Isaiah 30:2-4  ). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians (  2�Kings 18:14-16  ). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem (  Isaiah 36:2-22  ;   37:8  ). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (  37:1-7  ), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he \"spread before the Lord\" (  37:14  ). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. \"Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt.\" The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful (  2 Chronicles 32:23   2 Chronicles 32:27-29  ). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.).

He was born at Mamre, when Abraham was eighty-six years of age, eleven years after his arrival in Canaan (16:3; 21:5). At the age of thirteen he was circumcised (17:25). He grew up a true child of the desert, wild and wayward. On the occasion of the weaning of Isaac his rude and wayward spirit broke out in expressions of insult and mockery (21:9, 10); and Sarah, discovering this, said to Abraham, “Expel this slave and her son.” Influenced by a divine admonition, Abraham dismissed Hagar and her son with no more than a skin of water and some bread. The narrative describing this act is one of the most beautiful and touching incidents of patriarchal life ([Gen. 21:14-16](/gen#Gen.21.14)).\n\n Ishmael settled in the land of Paran, a region lying between Canaan and the mountains of Sinai; and “God was with him, and he became a great archer” ([Gen. 21:9-21](/gen#Gen.21.9)). He became a great desert chief, but of his history little is recorded. He was about ninety years of age when his father Abraham died, in connection with whose burial he once more for a moment reappears. On this occasion the two brothers met after being long separated. “Isaac with his hundreds of household slaves, Ishmael with his troops of wild retainers and half-savage allies, in all the state of a Bedouin prince, gathered before the cave of Machpelah, in the midst of the men of Heth, to pay the last duties to the ‘father of the faithful,’ would make a notable subject for an artist” ([Gen. 25:9](/gen#Gen.25.9)). Of the after events of his life but little is known. He died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years, but where and when are unknown (25:17). He had twelve sons, who became the founders of so many Arab tribes or colonies, the Ishmaelites, who spread over the wide desert spaces of Northern Arabia from the Red Sea to the Euphrates ([Gen. 37:25](/gen#Gen.37.25), [27](/gen#Gen.37.27), [28](/gen#Gen.37.28); 39:1), “their hand against every man, and every man’s hand against them.”"],"modified":"2020-09-02T16:46:28.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"reck3OffwMr5WIKJi","fields":{"personLookup":"ishmael_631","personID":631,"name":"Ishmael","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recysVC4Y15zCpJ8a","recHXZTuiBaw5EOhD","recj0KdJHsu9Qy6ls","recHUhyAIi4VMQkRW","recnFqOJACWRnuDv0","recmGymLOCellDc9Y","recCApCi0SyUUMoIz","recxy5LE1OwrGcBma","recVA7qcegqPAw1e4","recdJn7jAuGNcbkA3","recG8VuFRllht0y5u","recn4KcRdyi7TFJr2","recczX4GuYowVLz6U","recniXTFK0g6u9Rkb","recHW6HEymryJLBkP","reclLUOQDqL43Tzfi","recwYl9CYlIS6D6B8","recy7zY6dPTT8P0aL","rec9H7DwwbwBLx3lu","rec2zT6JceTM9AwHM","recMMIEFcjFNCzhp9"],"father":["Nethaniah 4"],"displayTitle":"Ishmael","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Ishmael (Ishmael, Ishmael or Yishma'el is a character who won a book of Genesis and then referenced in the Qur'an.

the name conferred on Jacob after the great prayer-struggle at Peniel (  Genesis 32:28  ), because \"as a prince he had power with God and prevailed.\" (See  JACOB  .) This is the common name given to Jacob's descendants. The whole people of the twelve tribes are called \"Israelites,\" the \"children of Israel\" (  Joshua 3:17  ;   7:25  ;   Judges 8:27  ;   Jeremiah 3:21  ), and the \"house of Israel\" (  Exodus 16:31  ;   40:38  ).    This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the true Israel (  Psalms 73:1  :   Isaiah 45:17  ;   49:3  ;   John 1:47  ;   Romans 9:6  ;   11:26  ).    After the death of Saul the ten tribes arrogated to themselves this name, as if they were the whole nation (  2 Samuel 2:9   2 Samuel 2:10   2 Samuel 2:17   2 Samuel 2:28  ;   2 Samuel 3:10   2 Samuel

Count":1,"dictText":["One who follows on another’s heels; supplanter, ([Gen. 25:26](/gen#Gen.25.26); [27:36](/gen#Gen.27.36); [Hos. 12:2-4](/hos#Hos.12.2)), the second born of the twin sons of Isaac by Rebekah. He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his father was fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years old. Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle disposition, and when he grew up followed the life of a shepherd, while his brother Esau became an enterprising hunter. His dealing with Esau, however, showed much mean selfishness and cunning ([Gen. 25:29-34](/gen#Gen.25.29)).\n\n When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his mother conspired to deceive the aged patriarch ([Gen. 27](/gen#Gen.27)), with the view of procuring the transfer of the birthright to himself. The birthright secured to him who possessed it (1) superior rank in his family ([Gen. 49:3](/gen#Gen.49.3)); (2) a double portion of the paternal inheritance ([Deut. 21:17](/deut#Deut.21.17)); (3) the priestly office in the family ([Num. 8:17-19](/num#Num.8.17)); and (4) the promise of the Seed in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed ([Gen. 22:18](/gen#Gen.22.18)).\n\n Soon after his acquisition of his father’s blessing ([Gen. 27](/gen#Gen.27)), Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid of the anger of Esau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac sent him away to Haran, 400 miles or more, to find a wife among his cousins, the family of Laban, the Syrian (28). There he met with Rachel (29). Laban would not consent to give him his daughter in marriage till he had served seven years; but to Jacob these years “seemed but a few days, for the love he had to her.” But when the seven years were expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave him his daughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to be completed probably before he obtained the beloved Rachel. But “life-long sorrow, disgrace, and trials, in the retributive providence of God, followed as a consequence of this double union.”\n\n At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob desired to return to his parents, but at the entreaty of Laban he tarried yet six years with him, tending his flocks (31:41). He then set out with his family and property “to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan” ([Gen. 31](/gen#Gen.31)). Laban was angry when he heard that Jacob had set out on his journey, and pursued after him, overtaking him in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind. After much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob, Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate farewell of his daughters, returns to his home in Padanaram. And now all connection of the Israelites with Mesopotamia is at an end.\n\n Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of angels, as if to greet him on his return and welcome him back to the Land of Promise (32:1, 2). He called the name of the place Mahanaim, i.e., “the double camp,” probably his own camp and that of the angels. The vision of angels was the counterpart of that he had formerly seen at Bethel, when, twenty years before, the weary, solitary traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached to heaven (28:12).\n\n He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother Esau with a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of mind he prepares for the worst. He feels that he must now depend only on God, and he betakes himself to him in earnest prayer, and sends on before him a munificent present to Esau, “a present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob.” Jacob’s family were then transported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained behind, spending the night in communion with God. While thus engaged, there appeared one in the form of a man who wrestled with him. In this mysterious contest Jacob prevailed, and as a memorial of it his name was changed to Israel (wrestler with God); and the place where this occured he called Peniel, “for”, said he, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved” (32:25-31).\n\n After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting, mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in the assurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met him; but his spirit of revenge was appeased, and the brothers met as friends, and during the remainder of their lives they maintained friendly relations. After a brief sojourn at Succoth, Jacob moved forward and pitched his tent near Shechem (q.v.), 33:18; but at length, under divine directions, he moved to Bethel, where he made an altar unto God (35:6, 7), and where God appeared to him and renewed the Abrahamic covenant. While journeying from Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name of Bethlehem), Rachel died in giving birth to her second son Benjamin (35:16-20), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth of Joseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre, to wait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The complete reconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their uniting in the burial of the patriarch (35:27-29).\n\n Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of his beloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers (37:33). Then follows the story of the famine, and the successive goings down into Egypt to buy corn (42), which led to the discovery of the long-lost Joseph, and the patriarch’s going down with all his household, numbering about seventy souls ([Ex. 1:5](/exod#Exod.1.5); [Deut. 10:22](/deut#Deut.10.22); [Acts 7:14](/acts#Acts.7.14)), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob, “after being strangely tossed about on a very rough ocean, found at last a tranquil harbour, where all the best affections of his nature were gently exercised and largely unfolded” ([Gen. 48](/gen#Gen.48)). At length the end of his checkered course draws nigh, and he summons his sons to his bedside that he may bless them. Among his last words he repeats the story of Rachel’s death, although forty years had passed away since that event took place, as tenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when “he had made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost” (49:33). His body was embalmed and carried with great pomp into the land of Canaan, and buried beside his wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah, according to his dying charge. There, probably, his embalmed body remains to this day (50:1-13).\n\n The history of Jacob is referred to by the prophets Hosea (12:3, 4, 12) and Malachi (1:2).

He and his wife were two of the eight saved in the ark ([1 Pet. 3:20](/1pet#1Pet.3.20)). He was the progenitor of many tribes inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of Asia ([Gen. 10:2-5](/gen#Gen.10.2)). An act of filial piety (9:20-27) was the occasion of Noah’s prophecy of the extension of his posterity.\n\n After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants of Noah, “the sons of Japheth” ([Gen. 10:2](/gen#Gen.10.2)), “the sons of Ham” (6), and “the sons of Shem” (22). It is important to notice that modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (10). The three great races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian (Allophylian). “Setting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of [Gen. 10](/gen#Gen.10)] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern times as the ‘Indo-European Theory,’ or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together under the one head of ’children of Shem’ the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the heading of ‘Semitic.’ Again, under the heading of ‘sons of Ham,’ the author has arranged ‘Cush’, i.e., the Ethiopians; ‘Mizraim,’ the people of Egypt; ‘Sheba and Dedan,’ or certain of the Southern Arabs; and ‘Nimrod,’ or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity” (Rawlinson’s Hist. Illustrations)."],"eventGroups":["The Flood","The Flood","The Flood","The Flood","The Flood"],"modified":"2020-08-27T01:11:30.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recdbuTa3C3j2ml0j","fields":{"personLookup":"japhia_727","personID":727,"name":"Japhia","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recOAQzIL6wGMpbHj"],"displayTitle":"Japhia","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Japhia (king of Lachish)","eastons":["recmDF168DaIZmyVG"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1451,"maxYear":-1451,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"japhia_727","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The king of Lachish, who joined in the confederacy against Joshua ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3)), and was defeated and slain.

His original name was Eliakim (q.v.).\n\n On the death of his father his younger brother Jehoahaz (=Shallum, [Jer. 22:11](/jer#Jer.22.11)), who favoured the Chaldeans against the Egyptians, was made king by the people; but the king of Egypt, Pharaoh-necho, invaded the land and deposed Jehoahaz ([2 Kings 23:33](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.33), [34](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.34); [Jer. 22:10-12](/jer#Jer.22.10)), setting Eliakim on the throne in his stead, and changing his name to Jehoiakim.\n\n After this the king of Egypt took no part in Jewish politics, having been defeated by the Chaldeans at Carchemish ([2 Kings 24:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.7); [Jer. 46:2](/jer#Jer.46.2)). Palestine was now invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiakim was taken prisoner and carried captive to Babylon ([2 Chr. 36:6](/2chr#2Chr.36.6), [7](/2chr#2Chr.36.7)). It was at this time that Daniel also and his three companions were taken captive to Babylon ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1), [2](/dan#Dan.1.2)).\n\n Nebuchadnezzar reinstated Jehoiakim on his throne, but treated him as a vassal king. In the year after this, Jeremiah caused his prophecies to be read by Baruch in the court of the temple. Jehoiakim, hearing of this, had them also read in the royal palace before himself. The words displeased him, and taking the roll from the hands of Baruch he cut it in pieces and threw it into the fire ([Jer. 36:23](/jer#Jer.36.23)). During his disastrous reign there was a return to the old idolatry and corruption of the days of Manasseh.\n\n After three years of subjection to Babylon, Jehoiakim withheld his tribute and threw off the yoke ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1)), hoping to make himself independent. Nebuchadnezzar sent bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, and Ammonites ([2 Kings 24:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.2)) to chastise his rebellious vassal. They cruelly harassed the whole country (comp. [Jer. 49:1-6](/jer#Jer.49.1)). The king came to a violent death, and his body having been thrown over the wall of Jerusalem, to convince the beseieging army that he was dead, after having been dragged away, was buried beyond the gates of Jerusalem “with the burial of an ass,” B.C. 599 ([Jer. 22:18](/jer#Jer.22.18), [19](/jer#Jer.22.19); 36:30).

After fortifying his kingdom against Israel ([2 Chr. 17:1](/2chr#2Chr.17.1), [2](/2chr#2Chr.17.2)), he set himself to cleanse the land of idolatry ([1 Kings 22:43](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.43)). In the third year of his reign he sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the law ([2 Chr. 17:7-9](/2chr#2Chr.17.7)). He enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people “in their basket and their store.”\n\n The great mistake of his reign was his entering into an alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, which involved him in much disgrace, and brought disaster on his kingdom ([1 Kings 22:1-33](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.1)). Escaping from the bloody battle of Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu ([2 Chr. 19:1-3](/2chr#2Chr.19.1)) reproached him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of God and in the righteous government of the people ([2 Chr. 19:4-11](/2chr#2Chr.19.4)).\n\n Again he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted ([2 Chr. 20:35-37](/2chr#2Chr.20.35); [1 Kings 22:48-49](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.48)).\n\n He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land ([2 Kings 3:4-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.4)).\n\n The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in [2 Chr. 20](/2chr#2Chr.20). The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court of the temple, “O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us.” Amid the silence that followed, the voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son Jehoram ([1 Kings 22:50](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.50)). He had this testimony, that “he sought the Lord with all his heart” ([2 Chr. 22:9](/2chr#2Chr.22.9)). The kingdom of Judah was never more prosperous than under his reign."],"modified":"2020-12-02T16:33:20.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec0OUmt7KruXeZPE","fields":{"personLookup":"jehoshaphat_809","personID":809,"name":"Jehoshaphat","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recrf3WrFdUOPC7Fd","reccZ0VOSgKfJMpV0"],"father":["Nimshi"],"children":["Jehu 4"],"displayTitle":"Jehoshaphat","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehoshaphat (Nimshi)","eastons":["reczmVGPF9PGwi3Ur"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-884,"maxYear":-884,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehoshaphat_809","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Nimshi, and father of Jehu, king of Israel ([2 Kings 9:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.2), [14](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.14))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recs4JE9k4YFztTRe","fields":{"personLookup":"jehoshaphat_810","personID":810,"name":"Jehoshaphat","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec1GsTqLVpcGaXNq"],"displayTitle":"Jehoshaphat","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehoshaphat (son of David)","eastons":["recRgQ2haO7c8ZiFp"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1042,"maxYear":-1042,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehoshaphat_810","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["One of the priests who accompanied the removal of the ark to Jerusalem ([1 Chr. 15:24](/1chr#1Chr.15.24))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recFVfDDfa4oFUT8v","fields":{"personLookup":"jehozabad_812","personID":812,"name":"Jehozabad","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recRde782dp668BKM","reck1ia0h76NcTBBt"],"father":["Shomer 1"],"displayTitle":"Jehozabad","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehozabad (assassins of King Jehoash)","eastons":["recTqa907Zd2dLe2x"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-840,"maxYear":-839,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehozabad_812","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Shomer, one of the two conspirators who put king Jehoash to death in Millo in Jerusalem ([2 Kings 12:21](/2kgs#2Kgs.12.21))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recARF4vjW1CIteby","fields":{"personLookup":"jehozabad_813","personID":813,"name":"Jehozabad","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"verses":["recCrEMiDQGgwMA72"],"siblings":["Ammiel 4","Issachar(no entry)","Joah 1","Nethaneel 5","Peulthai","Sachar 2","Shemaiah 9"],"father":["Shimei(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Jehozabad","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehozabad (Son of Shimei)","eastons":["rec1o9HazTG4Zz8kb"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1015,"maxYear":-1015,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehozabad_813","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Obed-edom ([1 Chr. 26:4](/1chr#1Chr.26.4)), one of the Levite porters."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recP5HmoASc1hrDEt","fields":{"personLookup":"jehozabad_814","personID":814,"name":"Jehozabad","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["receRqm9dJJnk5OCj"],"displayTitle":"Jehozabad","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehozabad (who had 180,000 men armed for battle)","eastons":["recV6r7eSleH4IVdG"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-912,"maxYear":-912,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehozabad_814","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["[2 Chr. 17:18](/2chr#2Chr.17.18)."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recD0WTn8jytakSeJ","fields":{"personLookup":"jehu_816","personID":816,"name":"Jehu","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recTGHtq9dhUrbxTa","recvCDneIBNQ12mKF","rec6C3WSOInsb7UPx","reclIpmStBrzjnWyh","recgteg9ZEqEI86em"],"father":["Hanani 2"],"displayTitle":"Jehu","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehu (the seer)","eastons":["rec6xSfPVJOXTrLfk"],"verseCount":5,"minYear":-931,"maxYear":-896,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehu_816","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Hanani, a prophet of Judah ([1 Kings 16:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.1), [7](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.7);

The story of his exaltation to the throne is deeply interesting. During the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of sympathy with him ([2 Kings 8:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.28), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.29)). The commanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared ([2 Kings 9:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.5), [6](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.6)). On being interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king ([2 Kings 9:11-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.11)). He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow (9:24). The king of Judah, when trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu’s soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two heaps at his gate. At “the shearing-house” ([2 Kings 10:12-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.12)) other forty-two connected with the house of Ahab were put to death ([2 Kings 10:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.14)). As Jehu rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria ([2 Kings 10:19-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.19)), and destroyed the temple of the idol ([2 Kings 10:27](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.27)).\n\n Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians ([2 Kings 10:29-33](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.29)). He died after a reign of twenty-eight years (B.C. 884-856), and was buried in Samaria (10:34-36). “He was one of those decisive, terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the earth.” He was the first Jewish king who came in contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II."],"modified":"2020-12-02T17:17:09.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recVNXMZE04TXPvtp","fields":{"personLookup":"jehu_818","personID":818,"name":"Jehu","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recM3YzDOkO6xrXLH"],"father":["Obed 2"],"children":["Azariah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Jehu","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehu was the tenth king.","eastons":["rec8bP2wLO5LVMn1A"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1470,"maxYear":-1470,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehu_818","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Obed, and father of Azariah ([1 Chr. 2:38](/1chr#1Chr.2.38))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recWi9vcA0wHCzQtY","fields":{"personLookup":"jehu_819","personID":819,"name":"Jehu","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec4DDRGjpS4dGLm1"],"father":["Josibiah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Jehu","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jehu (A Simeonite prince during the reign of Hezekiah)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1721,"maxYear":-1721,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehu_819","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recJXKysBwrpWAIBt","fields":{"personLookup":"jehu_820","personID":820,"name":"Jehu","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recrMDoeGOD6FIQnx"],"displayTitle":"Jehu","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Saul's Kinsman, The founder of the fifth dynasty of the kingdom of Israel, son of Jehoshaphat.","eastons":["recRCbzkNtprpYmtD"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehu_820","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["One of the Benjamite slingers that joined David at Ziklag ([1 Chr. 12:3](/1chr#1Chr.12.3))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recJgVBssemL5nw9w","fields":{"personLookup":"jehubbah_821","personID":821,"name":"Jehubbah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recDbqwwwM8CIHQ7b"],"verses":["recn1NCMjLZifRqHK"],"siblings":["Ahi(no entry)","Aram(no entry)","Rohgah(no entry)"],"father":["Shomer 2"],"displayTitle":"Jehubbah","status":"wip","verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehubbah_821","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recNSW71vQ2PsuT5m","fields":{"personLookup":"jehudi_823","personID":823,"name":"Jehudi","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recXwECSju7AyLkZU","rec2BvRdDcL8UGID1","recs6obzS0rcvDUus"],"father":["Nethaniah 3"],"displayTitle":"Jehudi","status":"wip","eastons":["recfjIMRg8T9Nq5YF"],"verseCount":3,"minYear":-606,"maxYear":-606,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jehudi_823","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A Jew, son of Nethaniah.

Israel six years (12:7). He has been described as “a wild, daring, Gilead mountaineer, a sort of warrior Elijah.” After forty-five years of comparative quiet Israel again apostatized, and in “process of time the children of Ammon made war against Israel” (11:5). In their distress the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob, to which he had fled when driven out wrongfully by his brothers from his father’s inheritance (2), and the people made him their head and captain. The “elders of Gilead” in their extremity summoned him to their aid, and he at once undertook the conduct of the war against Ammon. Twice he sent an embassy to the king of Ammon, but in vain. War was inevitable. The people obeyed his summons, and “the spirit of the Lord came upon him.” Before engaging in war he vowed that if successful he would offer as a “burnt-offering” whatever would come out of the door of his house first to meet him on his return. The defeat of the Ammonites was complete. “He smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards [Heb. ‘Abel Keramim], with a very great slaughter” ([Judg. 11:33](/judg#Judg.11.33)). The men of Ephraim regarded themselves as insulted in not having been called by Jephthah to go with him to war against Ammon. This led to a war between the men of Gilead and Ephraim (12:4), in which many of the Ephraimites perished. “Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead” (7)."],"modified":"2020-09-13T20:08:40.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recsZrzcKXJ8R2JCb","fields":{"personLookup":"jephunneh_840","personID":840,"name":"Jephunneh","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recWyWTjIkszdZ0Xm","rec2MAcEtx2zBpxH4","recMsP11WUgLP6FA2","rec6WtdUcfwYodzkt","recKK9NYnvXUMEBlC","recyeUz7CK5ceD7er","recs7AU0ho084hn4p","recjlgPvwNmQwoAun","recC0ZcSmPx7GOwUh","recqnyBoNx5MB3mer","recDkS3MMrQsly0N4","recCwdTwRPrPgVZ8x","recnuHaNZCxiFsS9o","recn2xocyKqMqNlzw","recmlM79sPdenfXwQ"],"children":["Kenaz 2","Caleb 3"],"displayTitle":"Jephunneh","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jephunneh (son of Judah Caleb)","eastons":["recz1p16wMlFmVPoZ"],"verseCount":15,"minYear":-1721,"maxYear":-1443,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jephunneh_840","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The father of Caleb, who was Joshua’s companion in exploring Canaan ([Num. 13:6](/num#Num.13.6)), a Kenezite ([Josh. 14:14](/josh#Josh.14.14))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"reckfpimfRLRkD8rp","fields":{"personLookup":"jephunneh_841","personID":841,"name":"Jephunneh","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recDbqwwwM8CIHQ7b"],"verses":["recy6GIcFkw6AZtq3"],"siblings":["Ara(no entry)","Pispah(no entry)"],"father":["Jether 4"],"displayTitle":"Jephunneh","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jephunneh (Kenizzite)","eastons":["recX8FmCVDAva9iKX"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jephunneh_841","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["One of the descendants of Asher ([1 Chr. 7:38](/1chr#1Chr.7.38))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recfQpbmpDRHmWHbB","fields":{"personLookup":"jerah_842","personID":842,"name":"Jerah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec3pOaXpsdeJlDRW","recZelySrxXn24Zdq"],"siblings":["Abimael","Almodad","Diklah(no entry)","Hadoram 2","Havilah 4","Hazar-maveth","Jobab 1","Ebal 2","Ophir 1","Sheba 2","Sheleph(no entry)","Uzal"],"father":["Joktan"],"displayTitle":"Jerah","status":"publish","verseCount":2,"minYear":-2247,"maxYear":-2247,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jerah_842","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2020-05-17T01:54:23.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rechPvKgcyi0fufSH","fields":{"personLookup":"jerahmeel_843","personID":843,"name":"Jerahmeel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E"],"verses":["rec6qNCseyIXRnpEb","rec0LRhfaavE7gdFM","recNtmRhNspmDgvLX","rechz6ffvwB9b613w","reca83fpZDoVRNGwh","recItdnt020gJ14n8"],"siblings":["Ashur(no entry)","Caleb 1","Ram 1","Segub 2"],"father":["Hezron 2"],"children":["Oren","Ahijah 2","Ram 2","Ozem 2","Bunah(no entry)","Onam(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Jerahmeel","status":"wip","partners":["Atarah(no entry)"],"ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jerahmeel (The name Jerahmeel (Hebrew יְרַחְמְאֵל, Yerachmi'el; Greek ιραμεηλ) appears several times in the Tanakh.

the “greater prophets” of the Old Testament, son of Hilkiah (q.v.), a priest of Anathoth ([Jer. 1:1](/jer#Jer.1.1); [32:6](/jer#Jer.32.6)). He was called to the prophetical office when still young (1:6), in the thirteenth year of Josiah (B.C. 628). He left his native place, and went to reside in Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of reformation ([2 Kings 23:1-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.1)). The death of this pious king was bewailed by the prophet as a national calamity ([2 Chr. 35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)).\n\n During the three years of the reign of Jehoahaz we find no reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under restraint ([Jer. 36:5](/jer#Jer.36.5)). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he was commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to read them to the people on the fast-day. This was done by Baruch his servant in his stead, and produced much public excitement. The roll was read to the king. In his recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah to be apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and wrote in it the words of the roll the king had destroyed, and “many like words” besides ([Jer. 36:32](/jer#Jer.36.32)).\n\n He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from time to time his words of warning, but without effect. He was there when Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city ([Jer. 37:4](/jer#Jer.37.4), [5](/jer#Jer.37.5)), B.C. 589. The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to withdraw and return to their own land. This, however, was only for a time. The prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from God announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take the city, and burn it with fire (37:7, 8). The princes, in their anger at such a message by Jeremiah, cast him into prison (37:15-38:13). He was still in confinement when the city was taken (B.C. 588). The Chaldeans released him, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, and refusing to listen to Jeremiah’s counsels, went down into Egypt, taking Jeremiah and Baruch with him ([Jer. 43:6](/jer#Jer.43.6)). There probably the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain seeking still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom they had so long revolted (44). He lived till the reign of Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been about ninety years of age at his death. We have no authentic record of his death. He may have died at Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there is nothing certain."],"modified":"2020-12-01T15:51:19.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recmNBhf0b7JjZ0eI","fields":{"personLookup":"jeremiah_854","personID":854,"name":"Jeremiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recrPM3GnIrVRBbEs","recNnOLpVTwjL3q34","recg9nnjd5YZO9E7F","recCe9BIGDZy4VSSX"],"displayTitle":"Jeremiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation

He was the son of a widow of Zereda, and while still young was promoted by Solomon to be chief superintendent of the “burnden”, i.e., of the bands of forced labourers. Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he fled to Egypt ([1 Kings 11:29-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.29)), where he remained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed “king of Israel” ([1 Kings 12](/1kgs#1Kgs.12): 1-20). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, “golden calves,” which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected. Thus he became distinguished as the man “who made Israel to sin.” This policy was followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel.\n\n While he was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a prophet from Judah appeared before him with a warning message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet for his bold words of defiance, his hand was “dried up,” and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At his urgent entreaty his “hand was restored him again” ([1 Kings 13:1-6](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.1), [9](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.9); comp. [2 Kings 23:15](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.15)); but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. His reign was one of constant war with the house of Judah.

He followed the example of the first Jeroboam in keeping up the worship of the golden calves ([2 Kings 14:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.24)). His reign was contemporary with those of Amaziah ([2 Kings 14:23](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.23)) and Uzziah (15:1), kings of Judah.

To distinguish him from others so called, he is spoken of as “Jesus of Nazareth” ([John 18:7](/john#John.18.7)), and “Jesus the son of Joseph” ([John 6:42](/john#John.6.42)).\n\n This is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua, which was originally Hoshea ([Num. 13:8](/num#Num.13.8), [16](/num#Num.13.16)), but changed by Moses into Jehoshua ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16); [1 Chr. 7:27](/1chr#1Chr.7.27)), or Joshua. After the Exile it assumed the form Jeshua, whence the Greek form Jesus. It was given to our Lord to denote the object of his mission, to save ([Matt. 1:21](/matt#Matt.1.21)).\n\n The life of Jesus on earth may be divided into two great periods, (1) that of his private life, till he was about thirty years of age; and (2) that of his public life, which lasted about three years.\n\n In the “fulness of time” he was born at Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter ([Matt. 1:1](/matt#Matt.1.1); [Luke 3:23](/luke#Luke.3.23); comp. [John 7:42](/john#John.7.42)). His birth was announced to the shepherds ([Luke 2:8-20](/luke#Luke.2.8)). Wise men from the east came to Bethlehem to see him who was born “King of the Jews,” bringing gifts with them ([Matt. 2:1-12](/matt#Matt.2.1)). Herod’s cruel jealousy led to Joseph’s flight into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they tarried till the death of this king ([Matt. 2:13-23](/matt#Matt.2.13)), when they returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee (2:23; comp. [Luke 4:16](/luke#Luke.4.16); [John 1:46](/john#John.1.46), etc.). At the age of twelve years he went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his parents. There, in the temple, “in the midst of the doctors,” all that heard him were “astonished at his understanding and answers” ([Luke 2:41](/luke#Luke.2.41), etc.).\n\n Eighteen years pass, of which we have no record beyond this, that he returned to Nazareth and “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” ([Luke 2:52](/luke#Luke.2.52)).\n\n He entered on his public ministry when he was about thirty years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended to about three years. “Each of these years had peculiar features of its own."],"modified":"2021-05-06T21:20:07.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recgkFqZovgbr3pAi","fields":{"personLookup":"jesus_905","personID":905,"name":"Jesus","surname":"Christ","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","birthYear":["rec6xKHEEzmyyIply"],"deathYear":["recHk3vUOLSfGfjTz"],"memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"birthPlace":["rec81f3wE4gATsRRE"],"deathPlace":["recL1WV82pXaRBQ59"],"dictionaryLink":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/christ.html","dictionaryText":" anointed, the Greek translation of the Hebrew word rendered \"Messiah\" (q.v.), the official title of our Lord, occurring five hundred and fourteen times in the New Testament. It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ (  Acts 17:3  ;   18:5  ;   Matthew 22:42  ), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by (  Isaiah 61:1  ), and by (  Daniel 9:24-26  ), who styles him \"Messiah the Prince.\"    The Messiah is the same person as \"the seed of the woman\" (  Genesis 3:15  ), \"the seed of Abraham\" (  Genesis 22:18  ), the \"Prophet like unto Moses\" (  Deuteronomy 18:15  ), \"the priest after the order of Melchizedek\" (  Psalms 110:4  ), \"the rod out of the stem of Jesse\" (  Isaiah 11:1    Isaiah 11:10  ), the \"Immanuel,\" the virgin's son (  Isaiah 7:14  ), \"the branch of Jehovah\" (  Isaiah 4:2  ), and \"the messenger of the covenant\" (  Malachi 3:1  ). This is he \"of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.\" The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men (  Hebrews 5:4  ;   Isaiah 11:2-4  ;   49:6  ;   John 5:37  ;   Acts 2:22  ).    To believe that \"Jesus is the Christ\" is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be.

Count":1,"dictText":["Anointed, the Greek translation of the Hebrew word rendered “Messiah” (q.v.), the official title of our Lord, occurring five hundred and fourteen times in the New Testament. It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ ([Acts 17:3](/acts#Acts.17.3); [18:5](/acts#Acts.18.5); [Matt. 22:42](/matt#Matt.22.42)), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by Isaiah (61:1), and by Daniel (9:24-26), who styles him “Messiah the Prince.”\n\n The Messiah is the same person as “the seed of the woman” ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)), “the seed of Abraham” ([Gen. 22:18](/gen#Gen.22.18)), the “Prophet like unto Moses” ([Deut. 18:15](/deut#Deut.18.15)), “the priest after the order of Melchizedek” ([Ps. 110:4](/ps#Ps.110.4)), “the rod out of the stem of Jesse” ([Isa. 11:1](/isa#Isa.11.1), [10](/isa#Isa.11.10)), the “Immanuel,” the virgin’s son ([Isa. 7:14](/isa#Isa.7.14)), “the branch of Jehovah” ([Isa. 4:2](/isa#Isa.4.2)), and “the messenger of the covenant” ([Mal. 3:1](/mal#Mal.3.1)). This is he “of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.” The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men ([Heb. 5:4](/heb#Heb.5.4); [Isa. 11:2-4](/isa#Isa.11.2); [49:6](/isa#Isa.49.6); [John 5:37](/john#John.5.37); [Acts 2:22](/acts#Acts.2.22)).\n\n To believe that “Jesus is the Christ” is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian ([1 Cor. 12:3](/1cor#1Cor.12.3); [1 John 5:1](/1john#1John.5.1))."],"eventGroups":["Ascension","Ascension","The Creation"],"modified":"2021-07-09T21:17:56.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recToEHysMuMQvUug","fields":{"personLookup":"jether_654","personID":654,"name":"Jether","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recDbqwwwM8CIHQ7b"],"verses":["recdY3Q4yMXrbfs0F","recy6GIcFkw6AZtq3"],"siblings":["Beera(no entry)","Beri(no entry)","Bezer 2","Imrah(no entry)","Harnepher","Hod(no entry)","Shamma(no entry)","Shilshah(no entry)","Ulla(no entry)","Suah(no entry)"],"father":["Zophah"],"children":["Ara(no entry)","Pispah(no entry)","Jephunneh 2"],"displayTitle":"Jether","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Ithran","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jether (Father of Amasa)","eastons":["recc5sUpfHDsZ77ob"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jether_654","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["[1 Chr. 7:38](/1chr#1Chr.7.38)."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recUoURurGRTnhD4Z","fields":{"personLookup":"jether_906","personID":906,"name":"Jether","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recjDRaYFQmAfUsBB"],"siblings":["Abimelech 3","Jotham 1"],"father":["Gideon"],"displayTitle":"Jether","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jether (Turning )","eastons":["recLxaLfZa8YXd3GC"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1245,"maxYear":-1245,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jether_906","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The oldest of Gideon’s seventy sons ([Judg. 8:20](/judg#Judg.8.20))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec1pWf6U6Z5bxylo","fields":{"personLookup":"jether_907","personID":907,"name":"Jether","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["reccDLGZ3UZ47hoFe","recPkJosk17hwRTe3","recL02EvyormxgdqF","rec7iJlSLox4y06I9"],"children":["Amasa 1"],"displayTitle":"Jether","status":"wip","partners":["Abigail 1"],"alsoCalled":"Ithra","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Jether (son of Ner)","eastons":["recg0VecIxOcru0Op"],"verseCount":4,"minYear":-1752,"maxYear":-1014,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jether_907","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The father of Amasa, David’s general ([1 Kings 2:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.5), [32](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.32));

This was the “first time that a king of Israel had allied himself by marriage with a heathen princess; and the alliance was in this case of a peculiarly disastrous kind. Jezebel has stamped her name on history as the representative of all that is designing, crafty, malicious, revengeful, and cruel. She is the first great instigator of persecution against the saints of God. Guided by no principle, restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in her attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains to maintain idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four hundred and fifty prophets ministered under her care to Baal, besides four hundred prophets of the groves [R.V., ’prophets of the Asherah’], which ate at her table ([1 Kings 18:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.18.19)). The idolatry, too, was of the most debased and sensual kind.” Her conduct was in many respects very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah (21:1-29). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu rode into the gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the window of the palace, and said, “Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?” He looked up and called to her chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so that she was dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses trod her under their feet. She was immediately consumed by the dogs of the street ([2 Kings 9:7-37](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.7)), according to the word of Elijah the Tishbite ([1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)).\n\n Her name afterwards came to be used as the synonym for a wicked woman ([Rev. 2](/rev#Rev.2): 20).\n\n It may be noted that she is said to have been the grand-aunt of Dido, the founder of Carthage."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec8rL9g71oMCW8CK","fields":{"personLookup":"jezer_1606","personID":1606,"name":"Jezer","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recvLnTX1XqhvGBx8"],"verses":["recVmWMfMT78fLNR3","recgwOUdCBaKtyxSa","reciKw5KHhIzE7IcS"],"siblings":["Jahzeel","Guni(no entry)","Shallum 6"],"father":["Naphtali"],"displayTitle":"Jezer","status":"wip","verseCount":3,"minYear":-1706,"maxYear":-1452,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jezer_1606","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recdg1hXnKuybP1XC","fields":{"personLookup":"jeziah_1607","personID":1607,"name":"Jeziah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recszv60BXFQd0GAG"],"displayTitle":"Jeziah","status":"wip","verseCount":1,"minYear":-456,"maxYear":-456,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jeziah_1607","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recchtZPgNpPL1Gp3","fields":{"personLookup":"jeziel_1608","personID":1608,"name":"Jeziel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recrMDoeGOD6FIQnx"],"siblings":["Pelet 2"],"father":["Azmaveth(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Jeziel","status":"wip","eastons":["rectY7mxZx72fxDU9"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"jeziel_1608","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Assembled by God, a son of Azmaveth.

of Zeruiah, David’s sister, and “captain of the host” during the whole of David’s reign ([2 Sam. 2:13](/2sam#2Sam.2.13); [10:7](/2sam#2Sam.10.7); [11:1](/2sam#2Sam.11.1); [1 Kings 11:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.15)). His father’s name is nowhere mentioned, although his sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned ([2 Sam. 2:32](/2sam#2Sam.2.32)). His two brothers were Abishai and Asahel, the swift of foot, who was killed by Abner ([2 Sam. 2:13-32](/2sam#2Sam.2.13)), whom Joab afterwards treacherously murdered (3:22-27). He afterwards led the assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount Zion, and for this service was raised to the rank of “prince of the king’s army” ([2 Sam. 5:6-10](/2sam#2Sam.5.6); [1 Chr. 27:34](/1chr#1Chr.27.34)). His chief military achievements were, (1) against the allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (2) against Edom ([1 Kings 11:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.15), [16](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.16)); and (3) against the Ammonites ([2 Sam. 10:7-19](/2sam#2Sam.10.7); [11:1](/2sam#2Sam.11.1), [11](/2sam#2Sam.11.11)). His character is deeply stained by the part he willingly took in the murder of Uriah (11:14-25). He acted apparently from a sense of duty in putting Absalom to death (18:1-14). David was unmindful of the many services Joab had rendered to him, and afterwards gave the command of the army to Amasa, Joab’s cousin ([2 Sam. 20:1-13](/2sam#2Sam.20.1); [19:13](/2sam#2Sam.19.13)). When David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in preference to that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by Benaiah, by the command of Solomon, in accordance with his father’s injunction ([2 Sam. 3:29](/2sam#2Sam.3.29); [20:5-13](/2sam#2Sam.20.5)), at the altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary conspirator died without one to lift up a voice in his favour. He was buried in his own property in the “wilderness,” probably in the north-east of Jerusalem ([1 Kings 2:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.5), [28](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.28)-34).

While the high priest lived, Jehoash favoured the worship of God and observed the law; but on his death he fell away into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry. Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was put to death. These evil deeds brought down on the land the judgement of God, and it was oppressed by the Syrian invaders.

He held the prophet Elisha in honour, and wept by his bedside when he was dying, addressing him in the words Elisha himself had used when Elijah was carried up into heaven: “O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof.” He was afterwards involved in war with Amaziah, the king of Judah ([2 Chr. 25:23-24](/2chr#2Chr.25.23)), whom he utterly defeated at Beth-shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia, and advancing on Jerusalem, broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the treasures of the temple and the palace. He soon after died (B.C. 825), and was buried in Samaria ([2 Kings 14:1-17](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.1), [19](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.19), [20](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.20)).

The mission of John was the subject of prophecy (  Matthew 3:3  ;   Isaiah 40:3  ;   Malachi 3:1  ). His birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God's truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision (  Luke 1:64  ). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in   Luke 1:80  . John was a Nazarite from his birth (  Luke 1:15  ;   Numbers 6:1-12  ). He spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea (  Matthew 3:1-12  ).    At length he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from \"every quarter\" were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a \"generation of vipers,\" and warned them of the folly of trusting to external privileges (  Luke 3:8  ). \"As a preacher, John was eminently practical and discriminating.

The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth (  Matthew 3:5  ), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to \"fulfil all righteousness\" (  3:15  ). John's special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now \"increase\" as the King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples, saying, \"Behold the Lamb of God.\" His public ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip (  Luke 3:19  ). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had occurred (  Matthew 14:3-12  ). John's death occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord's ministry.

He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee (  Matthew 4:21  ) and Salome (  Matthew 27:56  ; Compare   Mark 15:40  ), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (Compare   Mark 1:20  ;   Luke 5:3  ;   John 19:27  ). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\" and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers (  John 1:36   John 1:37  ) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them (  Matthew 4:  :   21  ;   Luke 5:1-11  ), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle (  Mark 5:37  ;   Matthew 17:1  ;   26:37  ;   Mark 13:3  ). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a \"Boanerges\" (  Mark 3:17  ). This spirit once and again broke out (  Matthew 20:20-24  ;   Mark 10:35-41  ;   Luke 9:49   Luke 9:54  ). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight (  John 18:15  ). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium (  John 18:16   John 18:19   John 18:28  ) and to the place of crucifixion (  John 19:26   John 19:27  ). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection (  20:2  ), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them (  John 21:1   John 21:7  ). We find Peter and John frequently after this together (  Acts 3:1  ;   4:13  ). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there (  Acts 15:6  ;   Galatians 2:9  ). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul's last visit (  Acts 21:15-40  ). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care (  Revelation 1:11  ). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos (  1:9  ); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical truth.","events":["recg8oUbA5xpce4An","recULlurLeelPiv2e","recXwHLlxf81Fa9IF","recrBjHLcBlfwkVDK"],"verses":["rec0irRHFyT2lkJHt","recYTV7Tvof6ZfuRI","recd4soARt4RHWNoI","recSxdVWj5zJTS9lc","recRJO0DQAXl0MhvW","rec5XrUpBDLg2fLzn","recS0Xj9u6jpKNHwh","recA0zgErcHqWGPMD","rec7P2Lo3oHfWtdAr","recWrl7hxWFjNGA5L","recZxQCHJJcFUgnho","recWS4hyNwF0IFISd","recPRDjsn4OonVmgA","recbEa1qocQEw90F4","recRJR3yNFuwZF29k","recyrr23avMxEFX9O","rec9kYoi6gvmJJt7u","rec0E2DVUa78kNJd9","rec6vEjr2bGwvKTtz","recYStPwxflNkp1JG","recEpHvN46LYgCtnu","recyga5mrP2VFfMPG","recZljA85tH4bjLbE","reczuuAx2sDCqPkeO","recXXy83J2h6Fz27n","recYYBKMnpGWNf2f6","recET7TdPT09GsZ0F","recMTYGvK77bQvISv","rec4uCVVgRcymP6y7","recjWSyDBMwzpAdt0","reclL7En6xCuYvcqQ","recw6oWHVsFsaFP8L","reciPYz91N0B8oeo2","rec2bAL4oCMAvUTb4","recVBOw2xbXM2YeQz"],"siblings":["James 1"],"chaptersWritten":["recRewBbXS7mVg3NN","recMK81fIA2FBwaNP","recPbqqK3hCNhgzh2","reclaV7B4IHu1CLor","rec6lIETVvqT6FF3x","recd9hgy0vpTAW3VA","rechlCy6ulGfJywHy","rec9o2JBXvXf6QX4Y","reczxqgpCwV1GvhzO","recJCQEwTM86i6mHK","rec9NjT9ytnXD22sn","recI6nMQWLs4QOBL1","recUHFl9VXnWqYeCm","recnWWQFBmWUecSaF","rec9S383butSmuSwl","recnHeDY8DGy7xywX","recD8vGiYCaX4Jplv","rec5U0e8J3XVAQW6B","recat3XylBUUNw22a","recHbq18r4FIAJ44B","rec36pNYmUq8A2Gd1","recae9fsaMGJA5asr","recAdlLNktEIVHUsd","rec5s6jjHTAalF81i","recb5JMGVgr0vCL3X","recMssh5ftJunCKSv","recUpCj7orTNacVvx","recC7eHfosTXlVT5U","rec4IteMmrzJkGwvB","recbY21K55SlkLybd","recHnMratQGyCTH8c","recxOJ1PS3Aq33fib","recp4Ehj1wVmA64Yk","rec9YooD5EPC31NyB","rec1AquO6rVXsEwGg","recfinW5fE4BBKKvB","recSWM1iLmySvfzGv","recC6M4OTsTi2CIze","recpkhxamPz5lL9if","rec7nSaVC1NcnKwGU","reckbWVyBYdPcXJ2A","recqCGdNsxjPdLIqN","rec4nzfmJisJHQhjj","recIBAJYaJwDRMKWH","recISNZ75E6DKUvGx","recViG0Pl9a6e5fvM","recuB1D0SVrXHk5Ix","recPVac7S0BL01NMm","reczCKBt9yqtbFq23","rec48NbZtyjNslLOV"],"mother":["Mother of Zebedees children(no entry)"],"father":["Zebedee"],"displayTitle":"John the Apostle","status":"publish","alsoCalled":"Boanerges","Disambiguation (temp)":"John (Son of Zebedee)","eastons":["recNP3wHaKAREYSni"],"timeline":["reczDqE366xgbgv2C","recLnDbrahKzEue0K","rech8qvzNnkDTqCi3","recP6mZs3oSlZdrT0","rec2rWYKV739WLO4b","recSpTfIckUAeEOLd"],"verseCount":35,"minYear":26,"maxYear":96,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"john_1677","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["THE APOSTLE, brother of James the “Greater” ([Matt. 4:21](/matt#Matt.4.21); [10:2](/matt#Matt.10.2); [Mark 1:19](/mark#Mark.1.19); [3:17](/mark#Mark.3.17); [10:35](/mark#Mark.10.35)). He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee ([Matt. 4:21](/matt#Matt.4.21)) and Salome ([Matt. 27:56](/matt#Matt.27.56); comp. [Mark 15:40](/mark#Mark.15.40)), and was born at Bethsaida.

He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, “Behold the Lamb of God,” and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers ([John 1:36](/john#John.1.36), [37](/john#John.1.37)) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them ([Matt. 4](/matt#Matt.4): 21; [Luke 5:1-11](/luke#Luke.5.1)), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle ([Mark 5:37](/mark#Mark.5.37); [Matt. 17:1](/matt#Matt.17.1); [26:37](/matt#Matt.26.37); [Mark 13:3](/mark#Mark.13.3)). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a “Boanerges” ([Mark 3:17](/mark#Mark.3.17)).

His first work was to reduce to subjection the Moabites, who had asserted their independence in the reign of his brother. Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, assisted Jehoram in this effort. He was further helped by his ally the king of Edom. Elisha went forth with the confederated army ([2 Kings 3:1-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.1)), and at the solicitation of Jehoshaphat encouraged the army with the assurance from the Lord of a speedy victory. The Moabites under Mesha their king were utterly routed and their cities destroyed. At Kir-haraseth Mesha made a final stand. The Israelites refrained from pressing their victory further, and returned to their own land.\n\n Elisha afterwards again befriended Jehoram when a war broke out between the Syrians and Israel, and in a remarkable way brought that war to a bloodless close ([2 Kings 6:23](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.23)). But Jehoram, becoming confident in his own power, sank into idolatry, and brought upon himself and his land another Syrian invasion, which led to great suffering and distress in Samaria ([2 Kings 6:24-33](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.24)).

'asaph] my reproach.\" \"The Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to me another son\" (  Genesis 30:24  ). He was a child of probably six years of age when his father returned from Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old patriarchal town of Hebron. \"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age,\" and he \"made him a long garment with sleeves\" (  Genesis 37:3  , RSV marg.), i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase, however, may also be rendered, \"a coat of many pieces\", i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of divers colours.    When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the jealous hatred of his brothers (  Genesis 37:4  ). They \"hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.\" Their anger was increased when he told them his dreams (  37:11  ).    Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot against him, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2,10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of a slave, for \"they cared little what they had for him, if so be they were rid of him.\" These merchants were going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an \"officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard\" (  Genesis 37:36  ). \"The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake,\" and Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a false charge having been brought against him by Potiphar's wife, he was at once cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years. After a while the \"chief of the cupbearers\" and the \"chief of the bakers\" of Pharaoh's household were cast into the same prison (  40:2  ). Each of these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had said.    This led to Joseph's being remembered subsequently by the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the king's dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph's wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt (  Genesis 41:46  ), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.    As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine \"over all the face of the earth,\" when \"all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn\" (  Genesis 41:56   Genesis 41:57  ;   Genesis 47:13   Genesis 47:14  ). Thus \"Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought.\" Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.    During this period of famine Joseph's brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read ( Genesis 4245 -45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, \"I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours.\" Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with \"all that they had,\" went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and \"fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while\" (  Genesis 46:29  ).    The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia.   Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in \"the field of Ephron the Hittite\" (  Genesis 47:29-31  ;   50:1-14  ). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.    \"The 'Story of the Two Brothers,' an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, 'the gift of the sun-god.' The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, 'nourisher of the living one,' i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state.\"   By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (  Genesis 41:50  ). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would \"bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,\" they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and \"they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin\" (  Genesis 50:26  ). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years' wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor (  Joshua 24:32  ; Compare   Genesis 33:19  ). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.    The Pharaoh of Joseph's elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (see PHARAOH), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos.   The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in   Deuteronomy 33:13-17  ; the kingdom of Israel in   Ezekiel 37:16   Ezekiel 37:19  ,   Amos 5:6  ; and the whole covenant people of Israel in   Psalms 81:4

The son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He is called Jehoshua in   Numbers 13:16   (A.V.), and Jesus in   Acts 7:45   and   Hebrews 4:8   (RSV, Joshua).    He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb, with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of the host of the Israelites at their great battle against the Amalekites in Rephidim (  Exodus 17:8-16  ). He became Moses' minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables (  Exodus 32:17  ). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (  Numbers 13:16   Numbers 13:17  ), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor (  Deuteronomy 31:23  ). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command (  Joshua 1:1  ); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord's host, who spoke to him encouraging words (  1:1-9  ).    Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him (  Joshua 11:18-23  ;   12:24  ). Having thus subdued the Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as his own inheritance. (See SHILOH;  PRIEST .)   His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah (  Joshua 24  ); and \"the light of Israel for the time faded away.\"    Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ (  Hebrews 4:8  ) in the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both; (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel succeeds the Law.    The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by Edersheim:, \"Born a slave in Egypt, he must have been about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive battle against Amalek (  Exodus 17:9   Exodus 17:13  ), while Moses in the prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given 'rod.' It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, 'help,' to Jehoshua, 'Jehovah is help' (  Numbers 13:16  ). And this name is the key to his life and work.

The son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He is called Jehoshua in [Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16) (A.V.), and Jesus in [Acts 7:45](/acts#Acts.7.45) and [Heb. 4:8](/heb#Heb.4.8) (R.V., Joshua).\n\n He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb, with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of the host of the Israelites at their great battle against the Amalekites in Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-16](/exod#Exod.17.8)). He became Moses’ minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables ([Ex. 32:17](/exod#Exod.32.17)). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16), [17](/num#Num.13.17)), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor ([Deut. 31:23](/deut#Deut.31.23)). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command ([Josh. 1:1](/josh#Josh.1.1)); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord’s host, who spoke to him encouraging words (1:1-9).\n\n Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him ([Josh. 11:18-23](/josh#Josh.11.18); [12:24](/josh#Josh.12.24)). Having thus subdued the Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as his own inheritance.\n\n His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah ([Josh. 24](/josh#Josh.24)); and “the light of Israel for the time faded away.”\n\n Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ ([Heb. 4:8](/heb#Heb.4.8)) in the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both; (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel succeeds the Law.\n\n The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by Edersheim:, “Born a slave in Egypt, he must have been about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive battle against Amalek ([Ex. 17:9](/exod#Exod.17.9), [13](/exod#Exod.17.13)), while Moses in the prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given ‘rod.’ It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, ‘help,’ to Jehoshua, ‘Jehovah is help’ ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16)). And this name is the key to his life and work. Alike in bringing the people into Canaan, in his wars, and in the distribution of the land among the tribes, from the miraculous crossing of Jordan and taking of Jericho to his last address, he was the embodiment of his new name, ‘Jehovah is help.’ To this outward calling his character also corresponded. It is marked by singleness of purpose, directness, and decision...He sets an object before him, and unswervingly follows it” (Bible Hist., iii. 103)"],"modified":"2020-12-04T13:51:55.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recPl6agJkpvSbKri","fields":{"personLookup":"joshua_1728","personID":1728,"name":"Joshua","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["reccoKp7HSSH0cqVk","rech3Pe2J7Wze4fPs"],"displayTitle":"Joshua","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Joshua (Israelite)","verseCount":2,"minYear":-1140,"maxYear":-1140,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"joshua_1728","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recFZ3EA96npimUEZ","fields":{"personLookup":"joshua_1729","personID":1729,"name":"Joshua","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recNfS4AshZ1dA3Ak"],"displayTitle":"Joshua","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Joshua (son of Nun)","verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"joshua_1729","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recNOn1RcB3sCzCnh","fields":{"personLookup":"josiah_1730","personID":1730,"name":"Josiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","birthYear":["recrmkZiXQJxvcDzC"],"deathYear":["recvO3xgOUGv2Axbi"],"memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"birthPlace":["recL1WV82pXaRBQ59"],"deathPlace":["recL1WV82pXaRBQ59"],"verses":["recrmdqI741fqWOh1","recGiocEZubTkMZwm","recdvqrvAFt7p1rvU","recBVbne9S52ZMHW4","rec1N7zj4O2Xw6edK","recWuQoKxqnYi0Mea","reckkebz7xq2ryz3G","recqMvMBWTQyiglQP","recXWiINuqogSxVVu","recNBmYL9OTqiK0CW","recoo3tOFr04v0MIP","recdhc7yfkhO7IL1b","recOWzG69fzaNb93D","recV3EtjfgK9bPltE","recwGQBtAFiTegPpq","recEYyyKZewEcWVUB","recrScV2TrqPW6E0j","recBqNQlx3VnEAU1c","recdON4YdShBqqSbl","recK5qkYJ4bqUfNMw","rectVk89WqlRnYOJN","receMgTvnOd2MtwOF","recs0yCS7yiMFqpou","rec2NlfhXk836pJlt","recZzmtNIEuB4wk9R","recS6qgrECO28T7Io","recmiHzNaTGzHHiyH","recuXyUSSgxuCrIGR","rec5O9WeY20c2DER8","rec5HwmYqs0oayofj","rec3r38uhOCtVL5pZ","reclyAzI5dfkH1Mf5","recK5gphWdsCSWIFg","rec6lxkC1I2wRaT83","recSIEIYuvEzY2chK","recTBs9iqhtgdDltB","recSS8OhihBktBbsM","recaNLIkY7vUNh03M","recgMtLSzRghSN6PD","recVdPQufVolRzAH8","recoTtjIuV1WNfgrX","rec8Um00CPOos7dEs","recP41zhUiD1Atg0U","recruv1tzflxwyHvb","recItN2fol47rIg0t","recQem8B3FnExDmgT","recxwLpAQ4fvcRRxi","recnOUpQUyxUmCNbJ","recHlREGoAXTNrhZB"],"mother":["Jedidah(no entry)"],"father":["Amon 2"],"children":["Johanan 2","Jehoiakim","Zedekiah 1","Shallum 11"],"displayTitle":"Josiah","status":"wip","partners":["Hamutal","Zebudah"],"alsoCalled":"Josias","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Josiah (king of Israel)","eastons":["rec6lEB4bDltuyEab"],"timeline":["recVf3eQjAq3nk94o","recsdAcHVpiiWFtm0"],"verseCount":49,"minYear":-1053,"maxYear":26,"alphaGroup":"J","slug":"josiah_1730","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Healed by Jehovah, or Jehovah will support. The son of Amon, and his successor on the throne of Judah ([2 Kings 22:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.1); [2 Chr. 34:1](/2chr#2Chr.34.1)). His history is contained in [2 Kings 22](/2kgs#2Kgs.22), [23](/2kgs#2Kgs.23). He stands foremost among all the kings of the line of David for unswerving loyalty to Jehovah (23:25). He “did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father.” He ascended the throne at the early age of eight years, and it appears that not till eight years afterwards did he begin “to seek after the God of David his father.” At that age he devoted himself to God. He distinguished himself by beginning a war of extermination against the prevailing idolatry, which had practically been the state religion for some seventy years ([2 Chr. 34:3](/2chr#2Chr.34.3); comp. [Jer. 25:3](/jer#Jer.25.3), [11](/jer#Jer.25.11), [29](/jer#Jer.25.29)).\n\n In the eighteenth year of his reign he proceeded to repair and beautify the temple, which by time and violence had become sorely dilapidated ([2 Kings 22:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.3), [5](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.5), [6](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.6); 23:23; [2 Chr. 34:11](/2chr#2Chr.34.11)). While this work was being carried on, Hilkiah, the high priest, discovered a roll, which was probably the original copy of the law, the entire Pentateuch, written by Moses.\n\n When this book was read to him, the king was alarmed by the things it contained, and sent for Huldah, the “prophetess,” for her counsel. She spoke to him words of encouragement, telling him that he would be gathered to his fathers in peace before the threatened days of judgment came. Josiah immediately gathered the people together, and engaged them in a renewal of their ancient national covenant with God. The Passover was then celebrated, as in the days of his great predecessor, Hezekiah, with unusual magnificence. Nevertheless, “the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah” ([2 Kings 22:3-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.3); [23:21-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.21); [2 Chr. 35:1-19](/2chr#2Chr.35.1)). During the progress of this great religious revolution Jeremiah helped it on by his earnest exhortations.\n\n Soon after this, Pharaoh-Necho II. (q.v.), king of Egypt, in an expedition against the king of Assyria, with the view of gaining possession of Carchemish, sought a passage through the territory of Judah for his army. This Josiah refused to permit. He had probably entered into some new alliance with the king of Assyria, and faithful to his word he sought to oppose the progress of Necho.\n\n The army of Judah went out and encountered that of Egypt at Megiddo, on the verge of the plain of Esdraelon. Josiah went into the field in disguise, and was fatally wounded by a random arrow. His attendants conveyed him toward Jerusalem, but had only reached Hadadrimmon, a few miles south of Megiddo, when he died ([2 Kings 23:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.28), [30](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.30); comp. [2 Chr. 35:20-27](/2chr#2Chr.35.20)), after a reign of thirty-one years. He was buried with the greatest honours in fulfilment of Huldah’s prophecy ([2 Kings 22:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.20); comp. [Jer. 34:5](/jer#Jer.34.5)). Jeremiah composed a funeral elegy on this the best of the kings of Israel ([Lam. 4:20](/lam#Lam.4.20); [2 Chr. 35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)). The outburst of national grief on account of his death became proverbial ([Zech. 12:11](/zech#Zech.12.11); comp.

Some older English translations, as well as the Douay–Rheims Bible, spell the name Core,[1] and many Eastern European translations have Korak. According to the Book of Genesis 36:5, Korah was the son of Esau and Aholibamah, and had two brothers, Jeush and Jaalam. Genesis 36:14 has Korah's mother, Aholibamah, being daughter of Anah, and granddaughter of Zibeon, making Zibeon Korah's maternal great grandfather. The same verse repeats Genesis 36:5 and names his two brothers again. Anah in Genesis 36:2,14,18,25 mentioned above is the same as the Anah, the son of Zibeon in verse 24. In verse 2 and 14 it says, \"Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite.\" Some are confused with this wording and believe that it is saying that Anah is a daughter of Zibeon. In verse 24 it clearly says that Zibeon's two sons were Ajah and Anah. Since the original text does not have a literal word for \"granddaughter\", the word bat (\"daughter\") was used in both cases. But this sentence is stating that Aholibamah is the daughter of Anah and the \"granddaughter\" of Zibeon, not that Anah is the daughter of Zibeon.)","eastons":["recuoE8a9BK0VdHjd"],"verseCount":4,"minYear":-1853,"maxYear":-1712,"alphaGroup":"K","slug":"korah_1793","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The third son of Esau, by Aholibamah ([Gen. 36:14](/gen#Gen.36.14); [1 Chr. 1:35](/1chr#1Chr.1.35))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"reck78wSw5BXkLTC0","fields":{"personLookup":"korah_1794","personID":1794,"name":"Korah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recnFznt6f9LRRts3"],"siblings":["Amalek","Gatam(no entry)","Kenaz(no entry)","Omar","Teman(no entry)","Zepho(no entry)"],"father":["Eliphaz 2"],"displayTitle":"Korah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Korah (son of Eliphaz)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1712,"maxYear":-1712,"alphaGroup":"K","slug":"korah_1794","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rece4MdvDF2ule9OY","fields":{"personLookup":"korah_1795","personID":1795,"name":"Korah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"verses":["recbmY2k6qAw0U8hg","recoR51AHP3NdU1mH","recBD2Io8Rpjx7wp6","recTbVW6Xo5Xqe7mi","recGqKBgXsi2VmzDY","rec6WMTadva5R1gNa","rech0n6FYpyP7Uog7","recoDMWccZ3kvAiRN","recO1n4SBudinRw7L","recVIl2jXwdFJqAp0","reccneNncPndPWFsC","recWEv1L5tfMxdeIW","rec5gMSZiDkJu3Mwh","recVGdF6DJle1pfnq","recGB2hdEiy1Q7C3B","recGLnllNjTYz9X36","recU8E4zqS0IbQVxZ","recqVw3VEdSrY1iJq","recbU0oKiiaFvdrOP","recFhVhu1jrAYWbSl","rechAqT7nCzLWtZVZ","recGVljyRC7XbSGRL","reclScwBh2O8UfTbs","recAZkNX36b3mypez","recW2BdtRrMthJCsC","recD4dHftWSsr3ao2"],"siblings":["Nepheg(no entry)","Shelomoth(no entry)","Zichri(no entry)"],"father":["Izhar"],"children":["Elkanah 1","Abiasaph","Assir(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Korah (Levite)","status":"publish","alsoCalled":"Core","Disambiguation (temp)":"Korah(sons of Izhar)","eastons":["recFxP11hQ1EhOday"],"verseCount":26,"minYear":-1700,"maxYear":66,"alphaGroup":"K","slug":"korah_1795","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A Levite, the son of Izhar, the brother of Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron ([Ex. 6:21](/exod#Exod.6.21)). The institution of the Aaronic priesthood and the Levitical service at Sinai was a great religious revolution. The old priesthood of the heads of families passed away. This gave rise to murmurings and discontent, while the Israelites were encamped at Kadesh for the first time, which came to a head in a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, headed by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty princes, “men of renown” i.e., well-known men from among the other tribes, joined this conspiracy. The whole company demanded of Moses and Aaron that the old state of things should be restored, alleging that “they took too much upon them” ([Num. 16:1-3](/num#Num.16.1)). On the morning after the outbreak, Korah and his associates presented themselves at the door of the tabernacle, and “took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon.” But immediately “fire from the Lord” burst forth and destroyed them all ([Num. 16:35](/num#Num.16.35)). Dathan and Abiram “came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children,” and it came to pass “that the ground clave asunder that was under them; and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up.” A plague thereafter began among the people who sympathized in the rebellion, and was only stayed by Aaron’s appearing between the living and the dead, and making “an atonement for the people” (16:47).\n\n The descendants of the sons of Korah who did not participate in the rebellion afterwards rose to eminence in the Levitical service."],"modified":"2020-07-11T18:39:59.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"reclmxiVDl2tXfF4x","fields":{"personLookup":"korah_1796","personID":1796,"name":"Korah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E"],"verses":["recKzAzsF6phDSBr9"],"siblings":["Rekem 2","Shema(no entry)","Tappuah(no entry)"],"father":["Hebron 3"],"displayTitle":"Korah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Korah (leader of the famous rebellion against his cousins Moses and Aaron)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1470,"maxYear":-1470,"alphaGroup":"K","slug":"korah_1796","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recmSgF32FBkhk1Uh","fields":{"personLookup":"kore_1797","personID":1797,"name":"Kore","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"verses":["recFhVhu1jrAYWbSl","rech6GZc9zgRkQcde","rec1cCGll3UbzyEp7"],"siblings":["Assir(no entry)"],"father":["Abiasaph"],"children":["Shallum 7","Meshelemiah"],"displayTitle":"Kore","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Kore (son of Asaph)","eastons":["rectiOxKNxRGUYMhG"],"verseCount":3,"minYear":-1015,"maxYear":-536,"alphaGroup":"K","slug":"kore_1797","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A Levite and temple-warder of the Korahites, the son of Asaph.

The lot was always resorted to by the Hebrews with strictest reference to the interposition of God, and as a method of ascertaining the divine will ([Prov. 16:33](/prov#Prov.16.33)), and in serious cases of doubt ([Esther 3:7](/esth#Esth.3.7)). Thus the lot was used at the division of the land of Canaan among the serveral tribes ([Num. 26:55](/num#Num.26.55); [34:13](/num#Num.34.13)), at the detection of Achan ([Josh. 7:14](/josh#Josh.7.14), [18](/josh#Josh.7.18)), the election of Saul to be king ([1 Sam. 10:20](/1sam#1Sam.10.20), [21](/1sam#1Sam.10.21)), the distribution of the priestly offices of the temple service ([1 Chr. 24:3](/1chr#1Chr.24.3), [5](/1chr#1Chr.24.5), [19](/1chr#1Chr.24.19); [Luke 1:9](/luke#Luke.1.9)), and over the two goats at the feast of Atonement ([Lev. 16:8](/lev#Lev.16.8)). Matthias, who was “numbered with the eleven” ([Acts 1:24-26](/acts#Acts.1.24)), was chosen by lot.\n\n This word also denotes a portion or an inheritance ([Josh. 15:1](/josh#Josh.15.1); [Ps. 125:3](/ps#Ps.125.3); [Isa. 17:4](/isa#Isa.17.4)), and a destiny, as assigned by God ([Ps. 16:5](/ps#Ps.16.5); [Dan. 12:13](/dan#Dan.12.13)).\n\n Lot, (Heb. lot), a covering; veil, the son of Haran, and nephew of Abraham ([Gen. 11:27](/gen#Gen.11.27)). On the death of his father, he was left in charge of his grandfather Terah (31), after whose death he accompanied his uncle Abraham into Canaan (12:5), thence into Egypt (10), and back again to Canaan (13:1). After this he separated from him and settled in Sodom (13:5-13). There his righteous soul was “vexed” from day to day (2 Pet. 2:7), and he had great cause to regret this act. Not many years after the separation he was taken captive by Chedorlaomer, and was rescued by Abraham ([Gen. 14](/gen#Gen.14)). At length, when the judgment of God descended on the guilty cities of the plain ([Gen. 19:1-20](/gen#Gen.19.1)), Lot was miraculously delivered. When fleeing from the doomed city his wife “looked back from behind him, and became a pillar of salt.” There is to this day a peculiar crag at the south end of the Dead Sea, near Kumran, which the Arabs call Bint Sheik Lot, i.e., Lot’s wife. It is “a tall, isolated needle of rock, which really does bear a curious resemblance to an Arab woman with a child upon her shoulder.” From the words of warning in [Luke 17:32](/luke#Luke.17.32), “Remember Lot’s wife,” it would seem as if she had gone back, or tarried so long behind in the desire to save some of her goods, that she became involved in the destruction which fell on the city, and became a stiffened corpse, fixed for a time in the saline incrustations. She became “a pillar of salt”, i.e., as some think, of asphalt.\n\n Lot and his daughters sought refuge first in Zoar, and then, fearing to remain there longer, retired to a cave in the neighbouring mountains ([Gen. 19:30](/gen#Gen.19.30)).

From this time Luke was Paul’s constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem (20:6-21:18). He again disappears from view during Paul’s imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome (27:1), whither he accompanies him (28:2, 12-16), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment ([Philemon 1](/phlm#Phlm.1.1):24; [Col. 4:14](/col#Col.4.14)).

These priests were all descendants of Aaron, who had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. However, Nadab and Abihu died before Aaron and only Eleazar and Ithamar had sons. One priest, Zadok, from Eleazar's descendants and another priest, Ahimelech, from Ithamar's descendants were designated to help create the various priestly orders. Sixteen of Eleazar's descendants were selected to head priestly orders while only eight of Ithamar's descendants were so chosen. The passage states that this was done because of the greater number of leaders among Eleazar's descendants. Lots were drawn to designate the order of ministering for the heads of the priestly orders when they entered the temple.

Mark (Marcus, [Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10), etc.) was his Roman name, which gradually came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is called John in [Acts 13:5](/acts#Acts.13.5), [13](/acts#Acts.13.13), and Mark in 15:39, [2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11), etc.\n\n He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided ([Acts 12:12](/acts#Acts.12.12)). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10)). It was in his mother’s house that Peter found “many gathered together praying” when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his “son” ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)). It is probable that the “young man” spoken of in [Mark 14:51](/mark#Mark.14.51), [52](/mark#Mark.14.52) was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in [Acts 12:25](/acts#Acts.12.25). He went with Paul and Barnabas on their first journey (about A.D. 47) as their “minister,” but from some cause turned back when they reached Perga in Pamphylia ([Acts 12:25](/acts#Acts.12.25); [13:13](/acts#Acts.13.13)). Three years afterwards a “sharp contention” arose between Paul and Barnabas (15:36-40), because Paul would not take Mark with him.

One was absorbed, preoccupied, abstracted; the other was concentrated and single-hearted. Her own world was the all of Martha; Christ was the first thought with Mary. To Martha life was ‘a succession of particular businesses;’ to Mary life ’was rather the flow of one spirit.’ Martha was Petrine, Mary was Johannine. The one was a well-meaning, bustling busybody; the other was a reverent disciple, a wistful listener.” Paul had such a picture as that of Martha in his mind when he spoke of serving the Lord “without distraction” ([1 Cor. 7:35](/1cor#1Cor.7.35))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recnheSkryxih4g9J","fields":{"personLookup":"mary_1938","personID":1938,"name":"Mary","isProperName":true,"gender":"Female","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"dictionaryLink":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/mary.html","dictionaryText":" Hebrew Miriam. The wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus, called the \"Virgin Mary,\" though never so designated in Scripture (  Matthew 2:11  ;   Acts 1:14  ). Little is known of her personal history. Her genealogy is given in   Luke 3  . She was of the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David (  Psalms 132:11  ;   Luke 1:32  ). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was of the lineage of Aaron (  Luke 1:36  ).    While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah (  Luke 1:35  ). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah,   Joshua 15:55  ;   21:16  , in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving (  Luke 1:46-56  ; Compare   1�Samuel 2:1-10  ). After three months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware (  Matthew 1:18-25  ) of her condition, and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus (  Luke 2:1  ) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem (  Micah 5:2  ), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for strangers (  Luke 2:6   Luke 2:7  ). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called Jesus (  Matthew 1:21  ), because he was to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the following year and residence at Nazareth (  Matthew 2  ). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his being found among the doctors in the temple (  Luke 2:41-52  ). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not again mentioned.    After the commencement of our Lord's public ministry little notice is taken of Mary.

And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!\" The next time we find her is at the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other women (  John 19:26  ). From that hour John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room after the Ascension (  Acts 1:14  ). From this time she wholly disappears from public notice.

The typical significance of his history is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ch. 7. The apostle there points out the superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron in these several respects, (1) Even Abraham paid him tithes; (2) he blessed Abraham; (3) he is the type of a Priest who lives for ever; (4) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the person of Abraham; (5) the permanence of his priesthood in Christ implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6) he was made priest not without an oath; and (7) his priesthood can neither be transmitted nor interrupted by death: “this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.”\n\n The question as to who this mysterious personage was has given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It is an old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of Noah, who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a Canaanitish prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in his peculiar history and character an instructive type of our Lord, the great High Priest ([Heb. 5:6](/heb#Heb.5.6), [7](/heb#Heb.5.7); 6:20).

The child’s nurse hearing of this calamity, fled with him from Gibeah, the royal residence, and stumbling in her haste, the child was thrown to the ground and maimed in both his feet, and ever after was unable to walk (19:26). He was carried to the land of Gilead, where he found a refuge in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar, by whom he was brought up.\n\n Some years after this, when David had subdued all the adversaries of Israel, he began to think of the family of Jonathan, and discovered that Mephibosheth was residing in the house of Machir.

After this she did not see David for many years.

The relation between her and David soon after this was altered. They became alienated from each other. This happened on that memorable day when the ark was brought up in great triumph from its temporary resting-place to the Holy City. In David’s conduct on that occasion she saw nothing but a needless humiliation of the royal dignity ([1 Chr. 15:29](/1chr#1Chr.15.29)). She remained childless, and thus the races of David and Saul were not mixed.

It has been alleged that he was carried into captivity with Jeconiah, and hence that he must have been at least one hundred and twenty-nine years old in the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). But the words of Esther do not necessarily lead to this conclusion. It was probably Kish of whom it is said (ver. 6) that he “had been carried away with the captivity.”\n\n He resided at Susa, the metropolis of Persia. He adopted his cousin Hadassah (Esther), an orphan child, whom he tenderly brought up as his own daughter. When she was brought into the king’s harem and made queen in the room of the deposed queen Vashti, he was promoted to some office in the court of Ahasuerus, and was one of those who “sat in the king’s gate” ([Esther 2:21](/esth#Esth.2.21)). While holding this office, he discovered a plot of the eunuchs to put the king to death, which, by his vigilance, was defeated. His services to the king in this matter were duly recorded in the royal chronicles.\n\n Haman (q.v.) the Agagite had been raised to the highest position at court. Mordecai refused to bow down before him; and Haman, being stung to the quick by the conduct of Mordecai, resolved to accomplish his death in a wholesale destruction of the Jewish exiles throughout the Persian empire ([Esther 3:8-15](/esth#Esth.3.8)). Tidings of this cruel scheme soon reached the ears of Mordecai, who communicated with Queen Esther regarding it, and by her wise and bold intervention the scheme was frustrated. The Jews were delivered from destruction, Mordecai was raised to a high rank, and Haman was executed on the gallows he had by anticipation erected for Mordecai (6:2-7:10). In memory of the signal deliverance thus wrought for them, the Jews to this day celebrate the feast (9:26-32) of Purim (q.v.)."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recjNRR60PAuFtjha","fields":{"personLookup":"moses_2108","personID":2108,"name":"Moses","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","birthYear":["recTykRyztRZctxPm"],"deathYear":["rec1G0RddPZrfB8k3"],"memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"birthPlace":["recfrXyxhuYOczKTm"],"deathPlace":["recUMD4PyAqIzCkc0"],"dictionaryLink":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/moses.html","dictionaryText":" drawn (or Egypt. mesu, \"son;\" hence Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh (  Genesis 45:17-25  ), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd's life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the \"best of the land\", the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or \"shepherd\" king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).    Thus favoured, the Israelites began to \"multiply exceedingly\" (  Genesis 47:27  ), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their \"affliction\" (  Genesis 15:13  ) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and \"the land was filled with them\" (  Exodus 1:7  ). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.    In process of time \"a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph\" (  Exodus 1:8  ). (See  PHARAOH  .) The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and \"all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour\" (  Exodus 1:13   Exodus 1:14  ). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, \"the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew\" (  Exodus 1:12  ).    The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king's wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that \"the people multiplied\" more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river (  Exodus 1:22  ). But neither by this edict was the king's purpose effected.    One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites (  Exodus 6:16-20  ), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king's daughter \"saw the child; and behold the child wept.\" The princess (see  PHARAOH'S 'S DAUGHTER [1]) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, \"Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.\" Thus Jochebed's child, whom the princess called \"Moses\", i.e., \"Saved from the water\" (  Exodus 2:10  ), was ultimately restored to her.    As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his \"brethren.\" His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became \"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\" (  Acts 7:22  ). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became \"mighty in deeds\" (  Acts 7:22  ).    After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But \"beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew.\" He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and \"went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens\" (  Exodus 2:11  ). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly (  Hebrews 11:25-27  ), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father's house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.    He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the \"great Rameses,\" Rameses II.), who \"sought to slay Moses\" (  Exodus 2:15  ). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years (  Acts 7:30  ), under training unconsciously for his great life's work.    Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush (  Exodus 3  ), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and \"bring forth the children of Israel\" out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (  4:18-26  ). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (See  EXODUS  .) After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders (  Deuteronomy 1:1-4  ;   5:1-26:19;  ;   27:11-30:20),  ), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song (  Deuteronomy 32  ), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to \"the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho\" (  34:1  ), and from thence he surveys the land. \"Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar\" (  Deuteronomy 34:2-3  ), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord \"in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor\" (  34:6  ). The people mourned for him during thirty days.    Thus died \"Moses the man of God\" (  Deuteronomy 33:1  ;   Joshua 14:6  ). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and \"he endured as seeing him who is invisible.\" \"There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel\" (  Deuteronomy 34:10-12  ).    The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets.   In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ (  John 1:17  ;   2  co   3:13-18  ;   Hebrews 3:5   Hebrews 3:6  ). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself (  John 5:46  ; Compare   Deuteronomy 18:15   Deuteronomy 18:18   Deuteronomy 18:19  ;   Acts 7:37  ). In   Hebrews 3:1-19   this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.    In   Jude 1:9   mention is made of a contention between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses.

Count":1,"dictText":["Drawn (or Egypt. mesu, “son;” hence Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh ([Gen. 45:17-25](/gen#Gen.45.17)), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd’s life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the “best of the land”, the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or “shepherd” king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).\n\n Thus favoured, the Israelites began to “multiply exceedingly” ([Gen. 47:27](/gen#Gen.47.27)), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their “affliction” ([Gen. 15:13](/gen#Gen.15.13)) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and “the land was filled with them” ([Ex. 1:7](/exod#Exod.1.7)). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.\n\n In process of time “a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph” ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and “all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour” ([Ex. 1:13](/exod#Exod.1.13), [14](/exod#Exod.1.14)). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, “the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew” ([Ex. 1:12](/exod#Exod.1.12)).\n\n The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king’s wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that “the people multiplied” more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river ([Ex. 1:22](/exod#Exod.1.22)). But neither by this edict was the king’s purpose effected.\n\n One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites ([Ex. 6:16-20](/exod#Exod.6.16)), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king’s daughter “saw the child; and behold the child wept.” The princess (see  PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER [1]) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, “Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.” Thus Jochebed’s child, whom the princess called “Moses”, i.e., “Saved from the water” ([Ex. 2:10](/exod#Exod.2.10)), was ultimately restored to her.\n\n As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his “brethren.” His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became “learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians” ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became “mighty in deeds” ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)).\n\n After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But “beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew.” He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and “went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens” ([Ex. 2:11](/exod#Exod.2.11)). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly ([Heb. 11:25-27](/heb#Heb.11.25)), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father’s house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.\n\n He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the “great Rameses,” Rameses II.), who “sought to slay Moses” ([Ex. 2:15](/exod#Exod.2.15)). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years ([Acts 7:30](/acts#Acts.7.30)), under training unconsciously for his great life’s work.\n\n Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush ([Ex. 3](/exod#Exod.3)), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and “bring forth the children of Israel” out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (4:18-26). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders ([Deut. 1:1-4](/deut#Deut.1.1); [5:1-26:19](/deut#Deut.5.1); [27:11-30:20](/deut#Deut.27.11)), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song ([Deut. 32](/deut#Deut.32)), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to “the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho” (34:1), and from thence he surveys the land. “Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar” ([Deut. 34:2-3](/deut#Deut.34.2)), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord “in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor” (34:6). The people mourned for him during thirty days.\n\n Thus died “Moses the man of God” ([Deut. 33:1](/deut#Deut.33.1); [Josh. 14:6](/josh#Josh.14.6)). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and “he endured as seeing him who is invisible.” “There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel” ([Deut. 34:10-12](/deut#Deut.34.10)).\n\n The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets.\n\n In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ ([John 1:17](/john#John.1.17); [2 Cor. 3:13-18](/2cor#2Cor.3.13); [Heb. 3:5](/heb#Heb.3.5), [6](/heb#Heb.3.6)). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself ([John 5:46](/john#John.5.46); comp. [Deut. 18:15](/deut#Deut.18.15), [18](/deut#Deut.18.18), [19](/deut#Deut.18.19); [Acts 7:37](/acts#Acts.7.37)). In [Heb. 3:1-19](/heb#Heb.3.1) this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.\n\n In [Jude 1](/jude#Jude.1.1):9 mention is made of a contention between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses. This dispute is supposed to have had reference to the concealment of the body of Moses so as to prevent idolatry."],"modified":"2020-09-07T19:52:39.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recAS5jVEptIa8t06","fields":{"personLookup":"mother_of_aholah_and_aholibah_2109","personID":2109,"name":"Mother of Aholah and Aholibah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Female","verses":["recdmU2cqA6jkfB38"],"children":["Aholah(no entry)","Aholibah"],"displayTitle":"Mother of Aholah and Aholibah","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"mother","verseCount":1,"minYear":-593,"maxYear":-593,"alphaGroup":"M","slug":"mother_of_aholah_and_aholibah_2109","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recHDMqmPBwzMBJl7","fields":{"personLookup":"mother_of_lemuel_2110","personID":2110,"name":"Mother of Lemuel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Female","verses":["recs2jS7C36KblKDf"],"children":["Lemuel"],"displayTitle":"Mother of Lemuel","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"mother","verseCount":1,"minYear":-700,"maxYear":-700,"alphaGroup":"M","slug":"mother_of_lemuel_2110","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recfDCye2qNHFp6By","fields":{"personLookup":"mother_of_the_wife_of_simon_2111","personID":2111,"name":"Mother of the Wife of Simon","isProperName":true,"gender":"Female","verses":["recZzCLbepWwKhlJu","recAv7g7gTJzauLpv","recQePl9a1Ng48kdQ"],"children":["Wife of Simon(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Mother of the Wife of Simon","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"mother","timeline":["reczf8H4EoM3gfimU"],"verseCount":3,"minYear":27,"maxYear":31,"alphaGroup":"M","slug":"mother_of_the_wife_of_simon_2111","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2021-07-07T19:27:22.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec3zlwh7X1ceI9kB","fields":{"personLookup":"mother_of_zebedees_children_2112","personID":2112,"name":"Mother of Zebedees children","isProperName":true,"gender":"Female","verses":["recgfVeyCpdZMn92f","recUWOHNjC2CGw3D0"],"children":["James 1","John 3"],"displayTitle":"Mother of Zebedees children","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"mother","verseCount":2,"minYear":33,"maxYear":33,"alphaGroup":"M","slug":"mother_of_zebedees_children_2112","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"receijLoiUmHMKqzl","fields":{"personLookup":"moza_2113","personID":2113,"name":"Moza","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E"],"verses":["recvopfVMVH4S6jaN"],"siblings":["Achsa(no entry)","Ardon","Jahdai","Jesher","Gazez(no entry)","Haran 3","Mesha 2","Shobab 2"],"halfSiblingsSameFather":["Hur 2","Shaaph(no entry)","Sheber(no entry)","Sheva 1","Tirhanah(no entry)"],"mother":["Ephah 2"],"father":["Caleb 1"],"displayTitle":"Moza","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Moza (A descendant of Saul)","eastons":["recusWupNAUgwUIWU"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1470,"maxYear":-1470,"alphaGroup":"M","slug":"moza_2113","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["One of the sons of Caleb ([1 Chr. 2:46](/1chr#1Chr.2.46))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recXPDKOFwnkQIQeK","fields":{"personLookup":"moza_2114","personID":2114,"name":"Moza","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recWqQa0IPMOSOIr2","recGbeNhSKNPS0VaW","recMcsRGJgXrlZhEo","recYn683wIznWBCUN"],"father":["Zimri(no entry)"],"children":["Binea(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Moza","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Moza (father of Binea)","eastons":["recrOIfnVEjdlvtNb"],"verseCount":4,"minYear":-1200,"maxYear":-1200,"alphaGroup":"M","slug":"moza_2114","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Zimri, of the posterity of Saul ([1 Chr. 8:36](/1chr#1Chr.8.36), [37](/1chr#1Chr.8.37); [9:42](/1chr#1Chr.9.42), [43](/1chr#1Chr.9.43))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recErAx0r7cMOcbvP","fields":{"personLookup":"mushi_2116","personID":2116,"name":"Mushi","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"verses":["recaFNCzZ8Mb2AtPT","recYr44z7Tt8kL0YE","recLSLTW9xTRe3QnD","rece28AuS3ezVwZjV","recqaZc21JyqpzoWz","recN7EmlmqsxATdnx","recBRzgrhRp6l87vh","recOOq43nOftwT8o4"],"siblings":["Jaaziah","Mahli(no entry)"],"father":["Merari"],"children":["Mahli(no entry)","Eder 2","Jerimoth 2"],"displayTitle":"Mushi","status":"wip","eastons":["recr2UJIUsA47XBUq"],"verseCount":8,"minYear":-1700,"maxYear":-1015,"alphaGroup":"M","slug":"mushi_2116","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Receding, the second of the two sons of Merari ([Ex. 6:19](/exod#Exod.6.19); [Num. 3:20](/num#Num.3.20)).

This small “plat of ground” seems to have been all he possessed. It was a vineyard, and lay “hard by the palace of Ahab” ([1 Kings 21:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.1), [2](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.2)), who greatly coveted it. Naboth, however, refused on any terms to part with it to the king. He had inherited it from his fathers, and no Israelite could lawfully sell his property ([Lev. 25:23](/lev#Lev.25.23)). Jezebel, Ahab’s wife, was grievously offended at Naboth’s refusal to part with his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his death. His sons also shared his fate ([2 Kings 9:26](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.26); [1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)). She then came to Ahab and said, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which had so treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly enjoying his new possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly appeared before him and pronounced against him a fearful doom ([1 Kings 21:17-24](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.17)). Jehu and Bidcar were with Ahab at this time, and so deeply were the words of Elijah imprinted on Jehu’s memory that many years afterwards he refers to them ([2 Kings 9:26](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.26)), and he was the chief instrument in inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their house (9:30-37). The house of Ahab was extinguished by him. Not one of all his great men and his kinsfolk and his priests did Jehu spare (10:11).\n\n Ahab humbled himself at Elijah’s words ([1 Kings 21:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.28), [29](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.29)), and therefore the prophecy was fulfilled not in his fate but in that of his son Joram ([2 Kings 9:25](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.25)).\n\n The history of Naboth, compared with that of Ahab and Jezebel, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the law of a retributive providence, a law which runs through all history (comp.

He was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings. He married the daughter of Cyaxares, and thus the Median and Babylonian dynasties were united.\n\n Necho II., the king of Egypt, gained a victory over the Assyrians at Carchemish. This secured to Egypt the possession of the Syrian provinces of Assyria, including Palestine. The remaining provinces of the Assyrian empire were divided between Babylonia and Media. But Nabopolassar was ambitious of reconquering from Necho the western provinces of Syria, and for this purpose he sent his son with a powerful army westward ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1)). The Egyptians met him at Carchemish, where a furious battle was fought, resulting in the complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back ([Jer. 46:2-12](/jer#Jer.46.2)), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the sway of Babylon (B.C. 606). From that time “the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land” ([2 Kings 24:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.7)). Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the whole of Palestine, and took Jerusalem, carrying away captive a great multitude of the Jews, among whom were Daniel and his companions ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1), [2](/dan#Dan.1.2); [Jer. 27:19](/jer#Jer.27.19); [40:1](/jer#Jer.40.1)).\n\n Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who had reigned in Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1)). This led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army again to the conquest of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (B.C. 598). A third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom he carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the population of the city, and the sacred vessels of the temple, placing Zedekiah on the throne of Judah in his stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the prophet, entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city, which was at length taken and utterly destroyed (B.C. 586). Zedekiah was taken captive, and had his eyes put out by order of the king of Babylon, who made him a prisoner for the remainder of his life.\n\n An onyx cameo, now in the museum of Florence, bears on it an arrow-headed inscription, which is certainly ancient and genuine. The helmeted profile is said (Schrader) to be genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes), called Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of “Nebuchadrezzar.” The inscription has been thus translated:, “In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this made.”\n\n A clay tablet, now in the British Museum, bears the following inscription, the only one as yet found which refers to his wars: “In the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected [his army], and marched and spread abroad.” Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet ([Jer. 46:13-26](/jer#Jer.46.13); [Ezek. 29:2-20](/ezek#Ezek.29.2)). Having completed the subjugation of Phoenicia, and inflicted chastisement on Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar now set himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon ([Dan. 4:30](/dan#Dan.4.30)), and to add to the greatness and prosperity of his kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and reservoirs surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the kind mentioned in history ([Dan. 2:37](/dan#Dan.2.37)). He is represented as a “king of kings,” ruling over a vast kingdom of many provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers under him, “princes, governors, captains,” etc. (3:2, 3, 27). He may, indeed, be said to have created the mighty empire over which he ruled.\n\n “Modern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest monarch that Babylon, or perhaps the East generally, ever produced. He must have possessed an enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that in almost countless profusion cover the land, are composed of bricks stamped with his name. He appears to have built or restored almost every city and temple in the whole country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account of the immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon itself, abundantly illustrating the boast, ‘Is not this great Babylon which I have build?’” Rawlinson, Hist. Illustrations.\n\n After the incident of the “burning fiery furnace” ([Dan. 3](/dan#Dan.3)) into which the three Hebrew confessors were cast, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity, probably the form of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e, “the change of a man into a wolf”). A remarkable confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded by the recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an inscription to the effect that it was presented by Nebuchadnezzar to the great temple at Borsippa as a votive offering on account of his recovery from a terrible illness.\n\n He survived his recovery for some years, and died B.C. 562, in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of his age, after a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his son Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was succeeded by Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by Nabonadius (555-538), at the close of whose reign (less than a quarter of a century after the death of Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia.\n\n “I have examined,” says Sir H. Rawlinson, “the bricks belonging perhaps to a hundred different towns and cities in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and I never found any other legend than that of Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon.” Nine-tenths of all the bricks amid the ruins of Babylon are stamped with his name."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recnfMlF88NmhlZjB","fields":{"personLookup":"nebushasban_2168","personID":2168,"name":"Nebushasban","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rectUOjLLenRjSGk5"],"displayTitle":"Nebushasban","status":"wip","eastons":["recI7TVYyIq3p34ef"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-588,"maxYear":-588,"alphaGroup":"N","slug":"nebushasban_2168","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Adorer of Nebo, or Nebo saves me, the “Rabsaris,” or chief chamberlain, of the court of Babylon.

His family must have belonged to Jerusalem ([Neh. 2:3](/neh#Neh.2.3)). He was one of the “Jews of the dispersion,” and in his youth was appointed to the important office of royal cup-bearer at the palace of Shushan. The king, Artaxerxes Longimanus, seems to have been on terms of friendly familiarity with his attendant. Through his brother Hanani, and perhaps from other sources ([Neh. 1:2](/neh#Neh.1.2); [2:3](/neh#Neh.2.3)), he heard of the mournful and desolate condition of the Holy City, and was filled with sadness of heart. For many days he fasted and mourned and prayed for the place of his fathers’ sepulchres. At length the king observed his sadness of countenance and asked the reason of it. Nehemiah explained it all to the king, and obtained his permission to go up to Jerusalem and there to act as tirshatha, or governor of Judea. He went up in the spring of B.C. 446 (eleven years after Ezra), with a strong escort supplied by the king, and with letters to all the pashas of the provinces through which he had to pass, as also to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, directing him to assist Nehemiah. On his arrival he set himself to survey the city, and to form a plan for its restoration; a plan which he carried out with great skill and energy, so that the whole was completed in about six months. He remained in Judea for thirteen years as governor, carrying out many reforms, notwithstanding much opposition that he encountered ([Neh. 13:11](/neh#Neh.13.11)). He built up the state on the old lines, “supplementing and completing the work of Ezra,” and making all arrangements for the safety and good government of the city. At the close of this important period of his public life, he returned to Persia to the service of his royal master at Shushan or Ecbatana. Very soon after this the old corrupt state of things returned, showing the worthlessness to a large extent of the professions that had been made at the feast of the dedication of the walls of the city ([Neh. 12](/neh#Neh.12). See EZRA). Malachi now appeared among the people with words of stern reproof and solemn warning; and Nehemiah again returned from Persia (after an absence of some two years), and was grieved to see the widespread moral degeneracy that had taken place during his absence. He set himself with vigour to rectify the flagrant abuses that had sprung up, and restored the orderly administration of public worship and the outward observance of the law of Moses. Of his subsequent history we know nothing. Probably he remained at his post as governor till his death (about B.C. 413) in a good old age. The place of his death and burial is, however, unknown. “He resembled Ezra in his fiery zeal, in his active spirit of enterprise, and in the piety of his life: but he was of a bluffer and a fiercer mood; he had less patience with transgressors; he was a man of action rather than a man of thought, and more inclined to use force than persuasion. His practical sagacity and high courage were very markedly shown in the arrangement with which he carried through the rebuilding of the wall and balked the cunning plans of the ‘adversaries.’ The piety of his heart, his deeply religious spirit and constant sense of communion with and absolute dependence upon God, are strikingly exhibited, first in the long prayer recorded in ch. 1:5-11, and secondly and most remarkably in what have been called his ‘interjectional prayers’, those short but moving addresses to Almighty God which occur so frequently in his writings, the instinctive outpouring of a heart deeply moved, but ever resting itself upon God, and looking to God alone for aid in trouble, for the frustration of evil designs, and for final reward and acceptance” (Rawlinson).

From profane history and the inscriptions, we are led to conclude that he was the Neriglissar who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and succeeded him on the throne of Babylon (B.C. 559-556). He was married to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of a palace, the only one on the right bank of the Euphrates, bear inscriptions denoting that it was built by this king. He was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who was murdered after a reign of some nine months by a conspiracy of the nobles, one of whom, Nabonadius, ascended the vacant throne, and reigned for a period of seventeen years (B.C. 555-538), at the close of which period Babylon was taken by Cyrus. Belshazzar, who comes into notice in connection with the taking of Babylon, was by some supposed to have been the same as Nabonadius, who was called Nebuchadnezzar’s son ([Dan. 5:11](/dan#Dan.5.11), [18](/dan#Dan.5.18), [22](/dan#Dan.5.22)), because he had married his daughter. But it is known from the inscriptions that Nabonadius had a son called Belshazzar, who may have been his father’s associate on the throne at the time of the fall of Babylon, and who therefore would be the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. The Jews had only one word, usually rendered “father,” to represent also such a relationship as that of “grandfather” or “great-grandfather.”"],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recvcyxQJZhgpZHOW","fields":{"personLookup":"neri_2185","personID":2185,"name":"Neri","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"verses":["recSCxJ4N4bXK8ooE"],"father":["Melchi

=Saul (q.v.) was born about the same time as our Lord. His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy \"for use in the Gentile world,\" as \"Saul\" would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants.   Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in reputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education his native city could afford. His father was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood (  Acts 23:6  ; Phil   3:5  ). We learn nothing regarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from his youth up, \"touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless\" (Phil   3:6  ).    We read of his sister and his sister's son (  Acts 23:16  ), and of other relatives (  Romans 16:7   Romans 16:11   Romans 16:12  ). Though a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are not informed. \"It might be bought, or won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his father might have been expected to desire him to make use of it.\" Perhaps the most natural career for the youth to follow was that of a merchant. \"But it was decided that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one.\"    According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade before entering on the more direct preparation for the sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents from goats' hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest in Tarsus.   His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived \"in all good conscience,\" unstained by the vices of that great city.   After the period of his student-life expired, he probably left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the \"Nazarenes.\"   For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to much excitement among the Jews and much disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furious persecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity.   But the object of this persecution also failed. \"They that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.\" The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130 miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, with his few attendants, he steadily went onward, \"breathing out threatenings and slaughter.\" But the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his ears, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\" The risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the stricken persecutor, \"Who art thou, Lord?\" he said, \"I am Jesus whom thou persecutest\" (  Acts 9:5  ;   22:8  ;   26:15  ).    This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light (  Acts 9:8  ), his companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (  9:11  ). Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church (  9:11-16  ). The whole purpose of his life was now permanently changed.    Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudes of Arabia (  Galatians 1:17  ), perhaps of \"Sinai in Arabia,\" for the purpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been made to him. \"A veil of thick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is known. 'Immediately,' says St. Paul, 'I went away into Arabia.' The historian passes over the incident [Compare   Acts 9:23   and   1 Kings 11:38   1 Kings 11:39  ]. It is a mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the apostle's history, a breathless calm, which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life.\" Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to preach the gospel \"boldly in the name of Jesus\" (  Acts 9:27  ), but was soon obliged to flee (  9:25  ;   2  co.  11:33 ) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee (  Acts 9:28   Acts 9:29  ) from persecution. He now returned to his native Tarsus (  Galatians 1:21  ), where, for probably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.    At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for \"a whole year\" became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were called \"Christians\" (  Acts 11:26  ).    The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples began to give effect to the Master's command: \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\"   The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga (  Acts 13:13  ), where John Mark deserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we have any record (  13:16-51  ; comp   10:30-43  ), Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in every city to watch over the churches which had been gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had set out.    After remaining \"a long time\", probably till A.D. 50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which was there held (  Acts 15  ) decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the council.    After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: \"Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.\" Mark proposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met. Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for Mark to come to him at Rome (  Colossians 4:10  ;   2  Tim   4:11  ).    Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went by land, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into \"regions beyond,\" and still went forward through Phrygia and Galatia ( 16:6 ). Contrary to his intention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some bodily affliction (  Galatians 4:13   Galatians 4:14  ). Bithynia, a populous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on the north-western coast of Asia Minor (  Acts 16:8  ). Of this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account except some references to it in his Epistle to the (  Galatians 4:13  ).    As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, and heard him cry, \"Come over, and help us\" (  Acts 16:9  ). Paul recognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed into Achaia, \"the paradise of genius and renown.\" He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn (  17:17-31  ). The Athenians had received him with cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having \"saluted the church\" there, and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode \"some time\" (  Acts 18:20-23  ).    He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land in the \"upper coasts\" (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. \"This city was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being world-wide\" (Stalker's Life of St. Paul). Here a \"great door and effectual\" was opened to the apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which they could reach.   Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they made was in danger (see  DEMETRIUS ), organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas (  2�Corinthians 2:12  ), whence after some time he went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the shores of the Adriatic (  Romans 15:19  ), he then came into Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the greater part of this time in Corinth (  Acts 20:2  ). During his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him (  Acts 20:17  ), and then sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D. 58.    While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See TEMPLE, HEROD'S.) Rescued from their violence by the Roman commandant, he was conveyed as a prisoner to Caesarea, where, from various causes, he was detained a prisoner for two years in Herod's praetorium (  Acts 23:35  ). \"Paul was not kept in close confinement; he had at least the range of the barracks in which he was detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts on the edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across the blue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus, where his spiritual children were pining for him, or perhaps encountering dangers in which they sorely needed his presence. It was a mysterious providence which thus arrested his energies and condemned the ardent worker to inactivity; yet we can now see the reason for it. Paul was needing rest. After twenty years of incessant evangelization, he required leisure to garner the harvest of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing; it was a time of internal mental activity and silent progress\" (Stalker's Life of St. Paul).    At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to the emperor (  Acts 25:11  ). Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the \"Augustan cohort.\" After a long and perilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to occupy his own hired house, under constant military custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the gospel to many of them during these \"two whole years,\" and with the blessed result of spreading among the imperial guards, and even in Caesar's household, an interest in the truth (Phil   1:13  ). His rooms were resorted to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles (  Acts 28:23   Acts 28:30   Acts 28:31  ), and thus his imprisonment \"turned rather to the furtherance of the gospel,\" and his \"hired house\" became the centre of a gracious influence which spread over the whole city. According to a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.    This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared against him. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. \"There can be little doubt that he appered again at Nero's bar, and this time the charge did not break down. In all history there is not a more startling illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner's dock stood the best man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels. The fatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the block; the headsman's axe gleamed in the sun and fell; and the head of the apostle of the world rolled down in the dust\" (probably A.D. 66), four years

Count":1,"dictText":["'=Saul (q.v.) was born about the same time as our Lord. His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy “for use in the Gentile world,” as “Saul” would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants.\n\n Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in reputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education his native city could afford. His father was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood ([Acts 23:6](/acts#Acts.23.6); [Phil. 3:5](/phil#Phil.3.5)). We learn nothing regarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from his youth up, “touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless” ([Phil. 3:6](/phil#Phil.3.6)).\n\n We read of his sister and his sister’s son ([Acts 23:16](/acts#Acts.23.16)), and of other relatives ([Rom. 16:7](/rom#Rom.16.7), [11](/rom#Rom.16.11), [12](/rom#Rom.16.12)). Though a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are not informed. “It might be bought, or won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his father might have been expected to desire him to make use of it.” Perhaps the most natural career for the youth to follow was that of a merchant. “But it was decided that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one.”\n\n According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade before entering on the more direct preparation for the sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents from goats’ hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest in Tarsus.\n\n His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived “in all good conscience,” unstained by the vices of that great city.\n\n After the period of his student-life expired, he probably left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the “Nazarenes.”\n\n For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to much excitement among the Jews and much disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furious persecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity.\n\n But the object of this persecution also failed. “They that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.” The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130 miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, with his few attendants, he steadily went onward, “breathing out threatenings and slaughter.” But the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his ears, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” The risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the stricken persecutor, “Who art thou, Lord?” he said, “I am Jesus whom thou persecutest” ([Acts 9:5](/acts#Acts.9.5); [22:8](/acts#Acts.22.8); [26:15](/acts#Acts.26.15)).\n\n This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light ([Acts 9:8](/acts#Acts.9.8)), his companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (9:11). Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church (9:11-16). The whole purpose of his life was now permanently changed.\n\n Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudes of Arabia ([Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17)), perhaps of “Sinai in Arabia,” for the purpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been made to him. “A veil of thick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is known. ‘Immediately,’ says St. Paul, ‘I went away into Arabia.’ The historian passes over the incident [comp. [Acts 9:23](/acts#Acts.9.23) and [1 Kings 11:38](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.38), [39](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.39)]. It is a mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the apostle’s history, a breathless calm, which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life.” Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to preach the gospel “boldly in the name of Jesus” ([Acts 9:27](/acts#Acts.9.27)), but was soon obliged to flee (9:25; [2 Cor. 11:33](/2cor#2Cor.11.33)) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee ([Acts 9:28](/acts#Acts.9.28), [29](/acts#Acts.9.29)) from persecution. He now returned to his native Tarsus ([Gal. 1:21](/gal#Gal.1.21)), where, for probably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.\n\n At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for “a whole year” became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were called “Christians” ([Acts 11:26](/acts#Acts.11.26)).\n\n The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples began to give effect to the Master’s command: “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”\n\n The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga ([Acts 13:13](/acts#Acts.13.13)), where John Mark deserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we have any record (13:16-51; comp. 10:30-43), Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in every city to watch over the churches which had been gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had set out.\n\n After remaining “a long time”, probably till A.D. 50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which was there held ([Acts 15](/acts#Acts.15)) decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the council.\n\n After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: “Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.” Mark proposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met. Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for Mark to come to him at Rome ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10); [2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11)).\n\n Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went by land, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into “regions beyond,” and still went forward through Phrygia and Galatia (16:6). Contrary to his intention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some bodily affliction ([Gal. 4:13](/gal#Gal.4.13), [14](/gal#Gal.4.14)). Bithynia, a populous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on the north-western coast of Asia Minor ([Acts 16:8](/acts#Acts.16.8)). Of this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account except some references to it in his Epistle to the Galatians (4:13).\n\n As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, and heard him cry, “Come over, and help us” ([Acts 16:9](/acts#Acts.16.9)). Paul recognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed into Achaia, “the paradise of genius and renown.” He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn (17:17-31). The Athenians had received him with cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having “saluted the church” there, and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode “some time” ([Acts 18:20-23](/acts#Acts.18.20)).\n\n He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land in the “upper coasts” (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. “This city was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being world-wide” (Stalker’s Life of St. Paul). Here a “great door and effectual” was opened to the apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which they could reach.\n\n Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they made was in danger (see DEMETRIUS), organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas ([2 Cor. 2:12](/2cor#2Cor.2.12)), whence after some time he went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the shores of the Adriatic ([Rom. 15:19](/rom#Rom.15.19)), he then came into Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the greater part of this time in Corinth ([Acts 20:2](/acts#Acts.20.2)). During his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him ([Acts 20:17](/acts#Acts.20.17)), and then sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D. 58.\n\n While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See  TEMPLE, HEROD’S.)  Rescued from their violence by the Roman commandant, he was conveyed as a prisoner to Caesarea, where, from various causes, he was detained a prisoner for two years in Herod’s praetorium ([Acts 23:35](/acts#Acts.23.35)). “Paul was not kept in close confinement; he had at least the range of the barracks in which he was detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts on the edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across the blue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus, where his spiritual children were pining for him, or perhaps encountering dangers in which they sorely needed his presence. It was a mysterious providence which thus arrested his energies and condemned the ardent worker to inactivity; yet we can now see the reason for it. Paul was needing rest. After twenty years of incessant evangelization, he required leisure to garner the harvest of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing; it was a time of internal mental activity and silent progress” (Stalker’s Life of St. Paul).\n\n At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to the emperor ([Acts 25:11](/acts#Acts.25.11)). Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the “Augustan cohort.” After a long and perilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to occupy his own hired house, under constant military custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the gospel to many of them during these “two whole years,” and with the blessed result of spreading among the imperial guards, and even in Caesar’s household, an interest in the truth ([Phil. 1:13](/phil#Phil.1.13)). His rooms were resorted to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles ([Acts 28:23](/acts#Acts.28.23), [30](/acts#Acts.28.30), [31](/acts#Acts.28.31)), and thus his imprisonment “turned rather to the furtherance of the gospel,” and his “hired house” became the centre of a gracious influence which spread over the whole city. According to a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.\n\n This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared against him. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. “There can be little doubt that he appered again at Nero’s bar, and this time the charge did not break down. In all history there is not a more startling illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner’s dock stood the best man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels. The fatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the block; the headsman’s axe gleamed in the sun and fell; and the head of the apostle of the world rolled down in the dust” (probably A.D. 66), four years before the fall of Jerusalem."],"eventGroups":["Persecution/First Martyr","Persecution/First Martyr","Saul Converted","Saul Converted","Church founded at Antioch","First Missionary Journey","First Missionary Journey","First Missionary Journey","First Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","Third Missionary Journey","Third Missionary Journey","Third Missionary Journey","Third Missionary Journey","Third Missionary Journey","Third Missionary Journey","Third Missionary Journey","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Paul Arrested and Imprisoned","Journey to Rome","Journey to Rome","Journey to Rome","Journey to Rome","Journey to Rome","First Missionary Journey","First Missionary Journey","Second Missionary Journey","First Missionary Journey"],"modified":"2020-08-28T20:09:25.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recxX9sIwBgo0CRDq","fields":{"personLookup":"pedahel_2290","personID":2290,"name":"Pedahel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recMGPRGXWaP7X6kg"],"father":["Ammihud 3"],"displayTitle":"Pedahel","status":"wip","eastons":["recYArGGqVRQCKJ1u"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1452,"maxYear":-1452,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pedahel_2290","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Redeemed of God, the son of Ammihud, a prince of Naphtali ([Num. 34:28](/num#Num.34.28))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recetOupRHkC0Lei7","fields":{"personLookup":"pedahzur_2291","personID":2291,"name":"Pedahzur","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec70dowYiiImlmsH","recXNdqHpTs6CjQrM","recvVNVZgx1ETWfJm","rechqRSk3pnf9FdHN","rech4obrDFlIpwR7m"],"children":["Gamaliel 1"],"displayTitle":"Pedahzur","status":"wip","eastons":["recdTl4euRqqE9fM6"],"verseCount":5,"minYear":-1490,"maxYear":-1490,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pedahzur_2291","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Rock of redemption, the father of Gamaliel and prince of Manasseh at the time of the Exodus ([Num. 1:10](/num#Num.1.10); [2:20](/num#Num.2.20))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recVXO78PqCxhqQSg","fields":{"personLookup":"pedaiah_2292","personID":2292,"name":"Pedaiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"verses":["recet9cVoaPkaL9Si"],"children":["Zebudah"],"displayTitle":"Pedaiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Pedaiah (of Rumah)","eastons":["recoPPr1Jl7dUfwSI"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-610,"maxYear":-610,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pedaiah_2292","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The father of Zebudah, who was the wife of Josiah and mother of king Jehoiakim ([2 Kings 23:36](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.36))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recaI10eYw8BBEqFc","fields":{"personLookup":"pedaiah_2293","personID":2293,"name":"Pedaiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"verses":["rechFdBZojjUcvNDr","recAChIQ9BTDQAU1g"],"siblings":["Jecamiah(no entry)","Hoshama(no entry)","Malchiram(no entry)","Nedabiah","Shealtiel","Shenazar(no entry)","Zedekiah(no entry)"],"father":["Jehoiachin"],"children":["Zerubbabel","Shimei 4"],"displayTitle":"Pedaiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Pedaiah (Father of Zebudah)","eastons":["recwyA3cNXbbl7IEw"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-1053,"maxYear":-1053,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pedaiah_2293","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The father of Zerubbabel ([1 Chr. 3:17-19](/1chr#1Chr.3.17))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recA3VsVxNLR62nIx","fields":{"personLookup":"pedaiah_2294","personID":2294,"name":"Pedaiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recsbDT8kimrAtj5I"],"children":["Joel 6"],"displayTitle":"Pedaiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Pedaiah ( son of Jehoiachin the captive )","eastons":["rec9994p9BIISZcRi"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1015,"maxYear":-1015,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pedaiah_2294","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":[".

He was the son of Jona ([Matt. 16:17](/matt#Matt.16.17)). His mother is nowhere named in Scripture. He had a younger brother called Andrew, who first brought him to Jesus ([John 1:40-42](/john#John.1.40)). His native town was Bethsaida, on the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip belonged. Here he was brought up by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and was trained to the occupation of a fisher. His father had probably died while he was still young, and he and his brother were brought up under the care of Zebedee and his wife Salome ([Matt. 27:56](/matt#Matt.27.56); [Mark 15:40](/mark#Mark.15.40); [16:1](/mark#Mark.16.1)). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew, James, and John, spent their boyhood and early manhood in constant fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed all the advantages of a religious training, and were early instructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with the great prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. They did not probably enjoy, however, any special training in the study of the law under any of the rabbis. When Peter appeared before the Sanhedrin, he looked like an “unlearned man” ([Acts 4:13](/acts#Acts.4.13)).\n\n “Simon was a Galilean, and he was that out and out...The Galileans had a marked character of their own. They had a reputation for an independence and energy which often ran out into turbulence. They were at the same time of a franker and more transparent disposition than their brethren in the south. In all these respects, in bluntness, impetuosity, headiness, and simplicity, Simon was a genuine Galilean. They spoke a peculiar dialect. They had a difficulty with the guttural sounds and some others, and their pronunciation was reckoned harsh in Judea. The Galilean accent stuck to Simon all through his career. It betrayed him as a follower of Christ when he stood within the judgment-hall ([Mark 14:70](/mark#Mark.14.70)). It betrayed his own nationality and that of those conjoined with him on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:7](/acts#Acts.2.7)).” It would seem that Simon was married before he became an apostle. His wife’s mother is referred to ([Matt. 8:14](/matt#Matt.8.14); [Mark 1:30](/mark#Mark.1.30); [Luke 4:38](/luke#Luke.4.38)). He was in all probability accompanied by his wife on his missionary journeys ([1 Cor. 9:5](/1cor#1Cor.9.5); comp. [1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)).\n\n He appears to have been settled at Capernaum when Christ entered on his public ministry, and may have reached beyond the age of thirty. His house was large enough to give a home to his brother Andrew, his wife’s mother, and also to Christ, who seems to have lived with him ([Mark 1:29](/mark#Mark.1.29), [36](/mark#Mark.1.36); 2:1), as well as to his own family. It was apparently two stories high (2:4).\n\n At Bethabara (R.V., [John 1:28](/john#John.1.28), “Bethany”), beyond Jordan, John the Baptist had borne testimony concerning Jesus as the “Lamb of God” ([John 1:29-36](/john#John.1.29)). Andrew and John hearing it, followed Jesus, and abode with him where he was. They were convinced, by his gracious words and by the authority with which he spoke, that he was the Messiah ([Luke 4:22](/luke#Luke.4.22); [Matt. 7:29](/matt#Matt.7.29)); and Andrew went forth and found Simon and brought him to Jesus ([John 1:41](/john#John.1.41)).\n\n Jesus at once recognized Simon, and declared that hereafter he would be called Cephas, an Aramaic name corresponding to the Greek Petros, which means “a mass of rock detached from the living rock.” The Aramaic name does not occur again, but the name Peter gradually displaces the old name Simon, though our Lord himself always uses the name Simon when addressing him ([Matt. 17:25](/matt#Matt.17.25); [Mark 14:37](/mark#Mark.14.37); [Luke 22:31](/luke#Luke.22.31), comp. 21:15-17). We are not told what impression the first interview with Jesus produced on the mind of Simon. When we next meet him it is by the Sea of Galilee ([Matt. 4:18-22](/matt#Matt.4.18)). There the four (Simon and Andrew, James and John) had had an unsuccessful night’s fishing. Jesus appeared suddenly, and entering into Simon’s boat, bade him launch forth and let down the nets. He did so, and enclosed a great multitude of fishes. This was plainly a miracle wrought before Simon’s eyes. The awe-stricken disciple cast himself at the feet of Jesus, crying, “Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord” ([Luke 5:8](/luke#Luke.5.8)). Jesus addressed him with the assuring words, “Fear not,” and announced to him his life’s work. Simon responded at once to the call to become a disciple, and after this we find him in constant attendance on our Lord.\n\n He is next called into the rank of the apostleship, and becomes a “fisher of men” ([Matt. 4:19](/matt#Matt.4.19)) in the stormy seas of the world of human life ([Matt. 10:2-4](/matt#Matt.10.2); [Mark 3:13-19](/mark#Mark.3.13); [Luke 6:13-16](/luke#Luke.6.13)), and takes a more and more prominent part in all the leading events of our Lord’s life. It is he who utters that notable profession of faith at Capernaum ([John 6:66-69](/john#John.6.66)), and again at Caesarea Philippi ([Matt. 16:13-20](/matt#Matt.16.13); [Mark 8:27-30](/mark#Mark.8.27); [Luke 9:18-20](/luke#Luke.9.18)). This profession at Caesarea was one of supreme importance, and our Lord in response used these memorable words: “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.”\n\n “From that time forth” Jesus began to speak of his sufferings. For this Peter rebuked him. But our Lord in return rebuked Peter, speaking to him in sterner words than he ever used to any other of his disciples ([Matt. 16:21-23](/matt#Matt.16.21); [Mark 8:31-33](/mark#Mark.8.31)). At the close of his brief sojourn at Caesarea our Lord took Peter and James and John with him into “an high mountain apart,” and was transfigured before them. Peter on that occasion, under the impression the scene produced on his mind, exclaimed, “Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles” ([Matt. 17:1-9](/matt#Matt.17.1)).\n\n On his return to Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax (a didrachma, half a sacred shekel), which every Israelite of twenty years old and upwards had to pay ([Ex. 30:15](/exod#Exod.30.15)), came to Peter and reminded him that Jesus had not paid it ([Matt. 17:24-27](/matt#Matt.17.24)). Our Lord instructed Peter to go and catch a fish in the lake and take from its mouth the exact amount needed for the tax, viz., a stater, or two half-shekels. “That take,” said our Lord, “and give unto them for me and thee.”\n\n As the end was drawing nigh, our Lord sent Peter and John ([Luke 22:7-13](/luke#Luke.22.7)) into the city to prepare a place where he should keep the feast with his disciples. There he was forewarned of the fearful sin into which he afterwards fell (22:31-34). He accompanied our Lord from the guest-chamber to the garden of Gethsemane ([Luke 22:39-46](/luke#Luke.22.39)), which he and the other two who had been witnesses of the transfiguration were permitted to enter with our Lord, while the rest were left without. Here he passed through a strange experience. Under a sudden impulse he cut off the ear of Malchus (47-51), one of the band that had come forth to take Jesus. Then follow the scenes of the judgment-hall (54-61) and his bitter grief (62).\n\n He is found in John’s company early on the morning of the resurrection. He boldly entered into the empty grave ([John 20:1-10](/john#John.20.1)), and saw the “linen clothes laid by themselves” ([Luke 24:9-12](/luke#Luke.24.9)). To him, the first of the apostles, our risen Lord revealed himself, thus conferring on him a signal honour, and showing how fully he was restored to his favour ([Luke 24:34](/luke#Luke.24.34); [1 Cor. 15:5](/1cor#1Cor.15.5)). We next read of our Lord’s singular interview with Peter on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where he thrice asked him, “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?” ([John 21:1-19](/john#John.21.1)).\n\n After this scene at the lake we hear nothing of Peter till he again appears with the others at the ascension ([Acts 1:15-26](/acts#Acts.1.15)). It was he who proposed that the vacancy caused by the apostasy of Judas should be filled up. He is prominent on the day of Pentecost (2:14-40). The events of that day “completed the change in Peter himself which the painful discipline of his fall and all the lengthened process of previous training had been slowly making. He is now no more the unreliable, changeful, self-confident man, ever swaying between rash courage and weak timidity, but the stead-fast, trusted guide and director of the fellowship of believers, the intrepid preacher of Christ in Jerusalem and abroad. And now that he is become Cephas indeed, we hear almost nothing of the name Simon (only in [Acts 10:5](/acts#Acts.10.5), [32](/acts#Acts.10.32); 15:14), and he is known to us finally as Peter.”\n\n After the miracle at the temple gate ([Acts 3](/acts#Acts.3)) persecution arose against the Christians, and Peter was cast into prison. He boldly defended himself and his companions at the bar of the council (4:19, 20). A fresh outburst of violence against the Christians (5:17-21) led to the whole body of the apostles being cast into prison; but during the night they were wonderfully delivered, and were found in the morning teaching in the temple. A second time Peter defended them before the council ([Acts 5:29-32](/acts#Acts.5.29)), who, “when they had called the apostles and beaten them, let them go.”\n\n The time had come for Peter to leave Jerusalem. After labouring for some time in Samaria, he returned to Jerusalem, and reported to the church there the results of his work ([Acts 8:14-25](/acts#Acts.8.14)). Here he remained for a period, during which he met Paul for the first time since his conversion (9:26-30; [Gal. 1:18](/gal#Gal.1.18)). Leaving Jerusalem again, he went forth on a missionary journey to Lydda and Joppa ([Acts 9:32-43](/acts#Acts.9.32)). He is next called on to open the door of the Christian church to the Gentiles by the admission of Cornelius of Caesarea (ch. 10).\n\n After remaining for some time at Caesarea, he returned to Jerusalem ([Acts 11:1-18](/acts#Acts.11.1)), where he defended his conduct with reference to the Gentiles. Next we hear of his being cast into prison by Herod Agrippa (12:1-19); but in the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates, and he went forth and found refuge in the house of Mary.\n\n He took part in the deliberations of the council in Jerusalem ([Acts 15:1-31](/acts#Acts.15.1); [Gal. 2:1-10](/gal#Gal.2.1)) regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the church. This subject had awakened new interest at Antioch, and for its settlement was referred to the council of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. Here Paul and Peter met again.\n\n We have no further mention of Peter in the Acts of the Apostles. He seems to have gone down to Antioch after the council at Jerusalem, and there to have been guilty of dissembling, for which he was severely reprimanded by Paul ([Gal. 2:11-16](/gal#Gal.2.11)), who “rebuked him to his face.”\n\n After this he appears to have carried the gospel to the east, and to have laboured for a while at Babylon, on the Euphrates ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)). There is no satisfactory evidence that he was ever at Rome. Where or when he died is not certainly known. Probably he died between A.D. 64 and 67."],"eventGroups":["Ascension","Pentecost/Church Founded","Pentecost/Church Founded","Pentecost/Church Founded","Pentecost/Church Founded","Pentecost/Church Founded","Pentecost/Church Founded","Persecution/First Martyr","Persecution/First Martyr","Peter and Cornelius","Peter and Cornelius","Peter and Cornelius","Peter and Cornelius","Herod's persecution of James and Peter","Herod's persecution of James and Peter","Second Missionary Journey"],"modified":"2021-07-09T20:27:54.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec9986BaC0TA1Dt1","fields":{"personLookup":"pethahiah_2319","personID":2319,"name":"Pethahiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rectBAXej5lPOeN1n"],"displayTitle":"Pethahiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Pethahiah (A priest)","eastons":["recxVxSnRpKNBVoPu"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1015,"maxYear":-1015,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pethahiah_2319","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The chief of one of the priestly courses (the nineteenth) in the time of David ([1 Chr. 24:16](/1chr#1Chr.24.16))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recB30j5lTG6uBi6Q","fields":{"personLookup":"pethahiah_2320","personID":2320,"name":"Pethahiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec9KrKAPKsR1N1Nj"],"displayTitle":"Pethahiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Pethahiah (Jozabad)","eastons":["rec5uREOQj8Sz9VBU"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-456,"maxYear":-456,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pethahiah_2320","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A Levite ([Ezra 10:23](/ezra#Ezra.10.23))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recNZta9Z5rXLVG08","fields":{"personLookup":"pethahiah_2321","personID":2321,"name":"Pethahiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recp9FoofeTkP3NzU"],"displayTitle":"Pethahiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Pethahiah (son of Meshezabeel)","eastons":["recb7zKr8FgteqAXg"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pethahiah_2321","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["[Neh. 9:5](/neh#Neh.9.5)."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec1IxrJB8exoGGh4","fields":{"personLookup":"pethahiah_2322","personID":2322,"name":"Pethahiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recRRlz3XK4eeQTTA"],"father":["Meshezabeel(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Pethahiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"A descendant of Judah","eastons":["rec3LpjIdGDZYwO62"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pethahiah_2322","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["A descendant of Judah who had some office at the court of Persia ([Neh. 11:24](/neh#Neh.11.24))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"reclne7vg8FGDnJEi","fields":{"personLookup":"pethuel_2323","personID":2323,"name":"Pethuel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rec6l4Iardk75VmJS"],"children":["Joel 7"],"displayTitle":"Pethuel","status":"wip","eastons":["recATEQggfc7BNabs"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-800,"maxYear":-800,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pethuel_2323","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Vision of God, the father of Joel the prophet ([Joel 1:1](/joel#Joel.1.1))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recaClxo5SWbh8PIe","fields":{"personLookup":"peulthai_2324","personID":2324,"name":"Peulthai","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"verses":["recw0vGGdovfGA2ha"],"siblings":["Ammiel 4","Issachar(no entry)","Jehozabad 1","Joah 1","Nethaneel 5","Sachar 2","Shemaiah 9"],"father":["Shimei(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Peulthai","status":"wip","eastons":["recAc7Qb1Z7rHSVqa"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1015,"maxYear":-1015,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"peulthai_2324","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Wages of the Lord, one of the sons of Obed-edom, a Levite porter ([1 Chr. 26:5](/1chr#1Chr.26.5))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec2AyE0G07aHlpHg","fields":{"personLookup":"phaltiel_2326","personID":2326,"name":"Phaltiel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recLszCTfDNty3aKV","recwxiMqUZUVq8uJw"],"father":["Laish 3"],"displayTitle":"Phaltiel","status":"wip","partners":["Michal"],"eastons":["rec3DUBFudsBsmSr5"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-1060,"maxYear":-1048,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"phaltiel_2326","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Deliverance of the Lord, the son of Laish of Gallim ([1 Sam. 25:44](/1sam#1Sam.25.44))= Phaltiel ([2 Sam. 3:15](/2sam#2Sam.3.15)).

Recent discoveries, however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the “new king.”\n\n For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a change appears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in his government his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve years of age.\n\n Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places along the Nile. This led him to suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those in the secret volunteered to give information regarding this burial-place. The result was that a party was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirty centuries. “The temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three thousand years.” The exploring party being guided to the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turned sharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.\n\n Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound “once more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human view for ever.” “It seems strange that though the body of this man,” who overran Palestine with his armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses, “mouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their colour could be distinguished” (Manning’s Land of the Pharaohs).\n\n Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view “the most beautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which characterized the features of the living man. Most remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body points to considerably more than threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king.”"],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recOdl9oB4UWmbiqP","fields":{"personLookup":"pharaoh_2331","personID":2331,"name":"Pharaoh","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","dictionaryLink":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/pharaoh.html","dictionaryText":"  The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I., the fourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The \"Harris papyrus,\" found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.    \"In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that 'the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.' Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of 'country' or 'district' attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert.

He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The “Harris papyrus,” found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.\n\n “In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that ‘the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.’ Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of ‘country’ or ’district’ attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh’s version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the ‘men children’ of the Israelites being recorded. The statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to [Ex. 1:10-22](/exod#Exod.1.10).”"],"modified":"2019-07-19T02:57:45.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recM8puJim5xv2bHw","fields":{"personLookup":"pharaoh_2332","personID":2332,"name":"Pharaoh","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recbOfBYLVD1ZuvuA","recYu8UZGEyHLp3pN","reczZyEyF3dywqi1V","recC5fMibyZ8g6Pbu","recukFm37rfA5uALY","reczUTT2SEEfrmcP8","rec6rziSpyiBfxJ91","recG404wG41UL6mek","reca9NxbZexcz334O"],"children":["Pharaoh’s

Philip entered into conversation with him, and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad tidings of the Saviour. The eunuch received the message and believed, and was forthwith baptized, and then \"went on his way rejoicing.\" Philip was instantly caught away by the Spirit after the baptism, and the eunuch saw him no more. He was next found at Azotus, whence he went forth in his evangelistic work till he came to Caesarea. He is not mentioned again for about twenty years, when he is still found at Caesarea (  Acts 21:8  ) when Paul and his companions were on the way to Jerusalem. He then finally disappears from the page of history.","events":["recrhqMyTEdBLpgcD","recrBjHLcBlfwkVDK","reczEc25UOMfzRC9z","rec62DJaeYJACSStB"],"verses":["recZOy2rMLOs1xrOW","recRXc4UswpBjvW22","recHb4fA4XW4vDrP9","recMlpFYbF9IawOqG","recUDNv6yRlOdyHXu","recyYUNVqifHzitrx","rect1rVTPErXyE3n1","recMZTWYfCoHD4MVl","recmHJ0CZB3YWCPDn","recbfee9FH7XAZSHv","recIZzT96lp4lkk1S","recFya4N7kHatMwX2","recN4L3NAWmrJxF8a","recRYSVw02q832jIR","rec97CG5cAO1B4ASN","recGBlhN3XQg1Vea1"],"displayTitle":"Phillip the Evangelist","status":"publish","alsoCalled":"Philip","Disambiguation (temp)":"Philip (Servants of Christ and instrumental in the early church: Philip the disciple and apostle of Christ, and Philip the evangelist.)","eastons":["recEApNRHUnWH15YV"],"timeline":["recXUpfeHouc4qLEl","recP6mZs3oSlZdrT0","recvI0SgATGCasGsV","recxOoLkd6wFyKysC","rec4bAiAcAOo9mPwO"],"verseCount":16,"minYear":33,"maxYear":60,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"philip_2347","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["One of the “seven” ([Acts 6:5](/acts#Acts.6.5)), called also “the evangelist” (21:8, 9).

He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a \"typical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns.\"    After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod's palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a \"malefactor.\" Pilate was not satisfied with this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2) preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of assuming the title of king (  Luke 23:2  ). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into the palace (  John 18:33  ) and examined him in private (37,38); and then going out to the deputation still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault in Jesus (  Luke 23:4  ). This only aroused them to more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace \"throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee.\" When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery (  Luke 23:11   Luke 23:12  ).    Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision (  Matthew 27:19  ). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with the \"just person.\" Pilate's feelings of perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried out, \"Not this man, but Barabbas.\" Pilate answered, \"What then shall I do with Jesus?\" The fierce cry immediately followed. \"Let him be crucified.\" Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowning what to do, said, \"Why, what evil hath he done?\" but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out, \"Away with him! crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state (  Matthew 27:28  ;   John 19:2  ), and putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" They took also the reed and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.    Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium (  Matthew 27:27  ) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, saying, \"Behold the man!\" But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\" and brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to be \"the Son of God.\" Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, \"Whence art thou?\" Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said, \"Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?\" Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, \"Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\"    After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, \"If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend.\" This settled the matter. He was afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, \"I am innocent of the blood of this just person.\" The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, \"His blood be on us, and on our children.\" Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, \"We have no king but Caesar;\" and now Jesus is given up to them, and led away to be crucified.   By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate's name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him, however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles (  3:13  ;  4:27 ;   13:28  ), and in   1�Timothy 6:13  . In A.D. 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, and he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide.","verses":["rece8JTwmEuPh5Psg","recX9iKvCGAayONBV","rec7PnM6kBSSqEnzH","recFURarAlcMN1rNa","rec9JnIgyAB2gKeHM","recJ4ExSNqrXTlhMw","reckx6NyVBM5nVn92","recQDoGSXBQYCGCoS","rech92Lprd0uQcEFn","recTdsazhkYX01KFr","reckRbb8qopJy7Pjs","recB3HO6x2ughxy77","recR1g1JVHop7Tn3E","rec7J07etK5f2Xw5N","rec6AmdOj5Pf2NJvk","recFPht9xAEdhkusH","recqJb3OMjTDvN1uC","rec6GlNBjtBXKf64F","reccQZjjkNBdA9SPG","rec93euzgz1E2zLJY","rec3Kdd7rqaVjXWoR","recldthNTvkxhs1b3","rec65zpXJhqusBsj8","recwYewrUK7xEcEA6","recy31MrwdEmiHL7e","rec5EFf6OmyvZvCx9","recmQagin346zPXln","reconWGKT65wxrIpx","recH05KFsLD0JQgre","recMNiRog3k5kuKDG","reckJF91LjFNDRS54","recOIhId3RJpSeSWq","recUGCSgLDI28MSmU","recCf0XgkFgAgzabA","recEJPj6HsYQmPWAW","recLPUqm9fV0sv2zj","recSPsdO2gsT86iHH","recisErR8ogDe7oGe","recxnfJLmUDvf7xEm","recq571ihjAr22P32","recE3sHFu0Qb14QXk","recSFThGG4gqvpv16","recD0kpFBtKyeru9p","recjzngMsxq5D98nC","rec4H63IHcd5jXQEs","recTHhigB3OUXJZtA","recdlUIfllqm3fLHy","rechBs1QyUICnAfzg","recoHGFtmDjx9teaP","reco28etJFeccwf3C","recZWqdn2qi7LAsjY","recZVMGXdv30fwYCP","recIMKN1VzrNVSXbq","recmVZMwuwMAAd6fb"],"displayTitle":"Pontius Pilate","status":"publish","eastons":["recbSLtSRoELo4rZa"],"verseCount":54,"minYear":26,"maxYear":65,"alphaGroup":"P","slug":"pilate_2365","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Probably connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, and called “Pilate” from the Latin pileatus, i.e., “wearing the pileus”, which was the “cap or badge of a manumitted slave,” as indicating that he was a “freedman,” or the descendant of one.

When the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim, in the “Arabah” or Jordan valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to “spy the land.” After five days they returned, having swum across the river, which at this season, the month Abib, overflowed its banks from the melting of the snow on Lebanon.

The fact of her covering the spies with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof (2:6) is an ‘undesigned coincidence’ which strictly corroborates the narrative. It was the time of the barley harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in the Jordan valley, so that the bundles of flax stalks might have been expected to be drying just then” (Geikie’s Hours, etc., ii., 390)."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recxDs613r5LdFUDt","fields":{"personLookup":"raham_2389","personID":2389,"name":"Raham","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E"],"verses":["recbQOBTu74Qvyzek"],"father":["Shema(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Raham","status":"wip","eastons":["recXMvBqLEOw7HtbZ"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-1470,"maxYear":-1470,"alphaGroup":"R","slug":"raham_2389","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Merciful, one of the descendants of Caleb, the son of Hezron ([1 Chr. 2:44](/1chr#1Chr.2.44))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recfgjyoISoTGHblO","fields":{"personLookup":"rakem_2390","personID":2390,"name":"Rakem","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["rec4hpOWgtnNNXWSJ"],"verses":["recwRlWYqZ4vDJLFK"],"siblings":["Ulam(no entry)"],"father":["Sheresh"],"displayTitle":"Rakem","status":"wip","verseCount":1,"minYear":0,"maxYear":0,"alphaGroup":"R","slug":"rakem_2390","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recH7JpZUIqyGxHkt","fields":{"personLookup":"ram_2391","personID":2391,"name":"Ram","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E","rechHR2dYztVvgNWa"],"verses":["recJeZNmz043S0jbM","rec6qNCseyIXRnpEb","recF8ENdgAQIPJjFi","recjlAqd8mKmhFpYB","recXtxDnLyFJ3Nnl0","recGaxNHJFybqo9KT"],"siblings":["Ashur(no entry)","Caleb 1","Jerahmeel 1","Segub 2"],"father":["Hezron 2"],"children":["Amminadab 1"],"displayTitle":"Ram","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Aram","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Ram ((Hebrew: אֲרָם Aram) is a son of Shem, according to the Table of Nations in Genesis 10 of the Hebrew Bible, and the father of Uz, Hul, Gether and Mash or Meshech.[1] The Book of Chronicles lists Aram, Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech as descendants of Shem, although without stating explicitly that Aram is the father of the other four.[2] Aram is usually regarded as being the eponymous ancestor of the Aramean people of Northern Mesopotamia and Syria.)","eastons":["recjrJRhZA9Ov8F0l"],"verseCount":6,"minYear":-1752,"maxYear":26,"alphaGroup":"R","slug":"ram_2391","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Hezron, and one of the ancestors of the royal line ([Ruth 4:19](/ruth#Ruth.4.19)).

He was the son of Naamah “the Ammonitess,” some well-known Ammonitish princess ([1 Kings 14:21](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.21); [2 Chr. 12:13](/2chr#2Chr.12.13)). He was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne, and he reigned seventeen years (B.C. 975-958). Although he was acknowledged at once as the rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt desire to modify the character of the government. The burden of taxation to which they had been subjected during Solomon’s reign was very oppressive, and therefore the people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard their demands for relief ([1 Kings 12:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.4)). After three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the people haughtily (6-15). “The king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord” (comp. 11:31). This brought matters speedily to a crisis. The terrible cry was heard (comp. [2 Sam. 20:1](/2sam#2Sam.20.1)):\n\n “What portion have we in David?  Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:  To your tents, O Israel:  Now see to thine own house, David” ([1 Kings 12:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.16)).\n\n And now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was appalled, and tried concessions, but it was too late (18). The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam’s own tribe, alone remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom, with Jerusalem as its capital; while the northern ten tribes formed themselves into a separate kingdom, choosing Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win back the revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was prevented by the prophet Shemaiah (21-24; [2 Chr. 11:1-4](/2chr#2Chr.11.1)) from fulfilling his purpose.\n\n In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, Shishak (q.v.), one of the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred up, no doubt, by Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against him. Jerusalem submitted to the invader, who plundered the temple and virtually reduced the kingdom to the position of a vassal of Egypt ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26); [2 Chr. 12:5-9](/2chr#2Chr.12.5)). A remarkable memorial of this invasion has been discovered at Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on the walls of a small temple there. These sculptures represent the king, Shishak, holding in his hand a train of prisoners and other figures, with the names of the captured towns of Judah, the towns which Rehoboam had fortified ([2 Chr. 11:5-12](/2chr#2Chr.11.5)).\n\n The kingdom of Judah, under Rehoboam, sank more and more in moral and spiritual decay. “There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.” At length, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, Rehoboam “slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David” ([1 Kings 14:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31)). He was succeeded by his son Abijah."],"modified":"2020-11-05T20:37:03.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"rec2zFyiyLF2Kcfja","fields":{"personLookup":"rehum_2413","personID":2413,"name":"Rehum","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["rectjukq3LLQt9leA","recooZrcVI1nXiqhe","recAimimqG849f2or","receaEfFuDYPun8pr","rec9QhUlNux5GTDI5"],"displayTitle":"Rehum","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Harim,Nehum","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Rehum (leader of clan of Israel)","eastons":["recmvZvmzxFJyqGRy"],"verseCount":5,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"R","slug":"rehum_2413","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["One of “the children of the province” who returned from the Captivity ([Ezra 2:2](/ezra#Ezra.2.2));

This calamity was sent “for Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.” David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul’s sons.

The narrative of his life is given in [Judg. 13](/judg#Judg.13)-16. He was a “Nazarite unto God” from his birth, the first Nazarite mentioned in Scripture ([Judg. 13:3-5](/judg#Judg.13.3); comp. [Num. 6:1-21](/num#Num.6.1)). The first recorded event of his life was his marriage with a Philistine woman of Timnath ([Judg. 14:1-5](/judg#Judg.14.1)). Such a marriage was not forbidden by the law of Moses, as the Philistines did not form one of the seven doomed Canaanite nations ([Ex. 34:11-16](/exod#Exod.34.11); [Deut. 7:1-4](/deut#Deut.7.1)). It was, however, an ill-assorted and unblessed marriage. His wife was soon taken from him and given “to his companion” ([Judg. 14:20](/judg#Judg.14.20)). For this Samson took revenge by burning the “standing corn of the Philistines” (15:1-8), who, in their turn, in revenge “burnt her and her father with fire.” Her death he terribly avenged (15:7-19). During the twenty years following this he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life. Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with the last twenty years of Eli’s life. After this we have an account of his exploits at Gaza (16:1-3), and of his infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery (16:4-20), and then of his melancholy death (16:21-31). He perished in the last terrible destruction he brought upon his enemies. “So the dead which he slew at his death were more [in social and political importance=the elite of the people] than they which he slew in his life.”\n\n “Straining all his nerves, he bowed:  As with the force of winds and waters pent,  When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars  With horrible convulsion to and fro  He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew  The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder  Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,  Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,  Their choice nobility and flower.”  Milton’s Samson Agonistes."],"modified":"2020-09-13T20:20:52.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recZsS2Zu0zIDwqdv","fields":{"personLookup":"samuel_2469","personID":2469,"name":"Samuel","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","birthYear":["rec1aOVahAVfBizcw"],"deathYear":["recZ7yCRJNwVu95o1"],"memberOf":["recuYvXjZsXumRLPL"],"dictionaryLink":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/samuel.html","dictionaryText":" heard of God.

Here his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life passed away. \"The child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men\" (  2:26  ; Compare   Luke 2:52  ). It was a time of great and growing degeneracy in Israel (  Judges 21:19-21  ;   1 Samuel 2:12-17   1 Samuel 2:22  ). The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased in number and in power, were practically masters of the country, and kept the people in subjection (  1�Samuel 10:5  ;   13:3  ).    At this time new communications from God began to be made to the pious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the night season, calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli, he answered, \"Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.\" The message that came from the Lord was one of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligate sons. Samuel told it all to Eli, whose only answer to the terrible denunciations (  1�Samuel 3:11-18  ) was, \"It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good\", the passive submission of a weak character, not, in his case, the expression of the highest trust and faith. The Lord revealed himself now in divers manners to Samuel, and his fame and his influence increased throughout the land as of one divinely called to the prophetical office. A new period in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.    The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning under the wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt, and \"went out against the Philistines to battle.\" A fierce and disastrous battle was fought at Aphek, near to Ebenezer (  1 Samuel 4:1   1 Samuel 4:2  ). The Israelites were defeated, leaving 4,000 dead \"in the field.\" The chiefs of the people thought to repair this great disaster by carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol of Jehovah's presence. They accordingly, without consulting Samuel, fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp near Aphek. At the sight of the ark among them the people \"shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\" A second battle was fought, and again the Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed their camp, slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings of this fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so soon as the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken, he fell backward from his seat at the entrance of the sanctuary, and his neck brake, and he died. The tabernacle with its furniture was probably, by the advice of Samuel, now about twenty years of age, removed from Shiloh to some place of safety, and finally to Nob, where it remained many years (  21:1  ).    The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched upon Shiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (Compare   Jeremiah 7:12  ;   Psalms 78:59  ). This was a great epoch in the history of Israel. For twenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek the whole land lay under the oppression of the Philistines. During all these dreary years Samuel was a spiritual power in the land. From Ramah, his native place, where he resided, his influence went forth on every side among the people. With unwearied zeal he went up and down from place to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people, endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of their sinfulness, and to lead them to repentance. His labours were so far successful that \"all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.\" Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh, one of the loftiest hills in Central Palestine, where they fasted and prayed, and prepared themselves there, under his direction, for a great war against the Philistines, who now marched their whole force toward Mizpeh, in order to crush the Israelites once for all. At the intercession of Samuel God interposed in behalf of Israel. Samuel himself was their leader, the only occasion in which he acted as a leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed. They fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a great slaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C. 1095, put an end to the forty years of Philistine oppression. In memory of this great deliverance, and in token of gratitude for the help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a great stone in the battlefield, and called it \"Ebenezer,\" saying, \"Hitherto hath the Lord helped us\" (  1�Samuel 7:1-12  ). This was the spot where, twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great defeat, when the ark of God was taken.    This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long period of peace for Israel (  1 Samuel 7:13   1 Samuel 7:14  ), during which Samuel exercised the functions of judge, going \"from year to year in circuit\" from his home in Ramah to Bethel, thence to Gilgal (not that in the Jordan valley, but that which lay to the west of Ebal and Gerizim), and returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. He established regular services at Shiloh, where he built an altar; and at Ramah he gathered a company of young men around him and established a school of the prophets. The schools of the prophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also at Gibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an important influence on the national character and history of the people in maintaining pure religion in the midst of growing corruption. They continued to the end of the Jewish commonwealth.    Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised the functions of his judicial office, being the friend and counsellor of the people in all matters of private and public interest. He was a great statesman as well as a reformer, and all regarded him with veneration as the \"seer,\" the prophet of the Lord. At the close of this period, when he was now an old man, the elders of Israel came to him at Ramah (  1 Samuel 8:4   1 Samuel 8:5   1 Samuel 8:19-22  ); and feeling how great was the danger to which the nation was exposed from the misconduct of Samuel's sons, whom he had invested with judicial functions as his assistants, and had placed at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also from a threatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded that a king should be set over them. This request was very displeasing to Samuel. He remonstrated with them, and warned them of the consequences of such a step. At length, however, referring the matter to God, he acceded to their desires, and anointed Saul (q.v.) to be their king (  11:15  ). Before retiring from public life he convened an assembly of the people at Gilgal (ch. 12), and there solemnly addressed them with reference to his own relation to them as judge and prophet.    The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah, only occasionally and in special circumstances appearing again in public (  1�Samuel 1315  ,15) with communications from God to king Saul. While mourning over the many evils which now fell upon the nation, he is suddenly summoned (ch.16) to go to Bethlehem and anoint David, the son of Jesse, as king over Israel instead of Saul. After this little is known of him till the time of his death, which took place at Ramah when he was probably about eighty years of age. \"And all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah\" (  25:1  ), not in the house itself, but in the court or garden of his house. (Compare   2�Kings 21:18  ;   2  Chr  33:20 ;   1�Kings 2:34  ;   John 19:41  .)    Samuel's devotion to God, and the special favour with which God regarded him, are referred to in   Jeremiah 15:1   and   Psalms 99:6  .","verses":["recY9cuzbNIFLfSg1","rec1qZoMzt4c1sw8u","recLYW4KnNjtTDXWG","recQcAoMJKHnWxJA5","recDsEGO7h43FNz9h","recrI4i1laHjYz2Ku","rec1gwoTpvgCDnumx","recm9mh4JH3xtSSer","reclmStFu8YN0NORP","recN6cANKS6BONQh1","recTaZ5LptkKd4DBI","recLGzE28EEv0DgNj","rec2Z3McoZS1TZulB","recgT7adYkVwG5W4m","recp4b4YW9RzPpxz8","recU3LPzb5yjTiaSP","recZvmOp97bGUDyl1","recU6enfUaYQixfI4","recMtQMExdacgeSmE","recsQv0mkCeN0HBtU","recHfER7FAgp7n9z5","recGhJbiiUU8Dwdt0","rechEmOP9Up7hlGv3","recJEcgbDBJEOpIiL","recm5z1k6bI8pBl6B","recivhi2fqlcm7O8Q","recQJHaej6OIT2Jtq","recjas6yNGaRd1lqf","recKLr0AUSi0oadqf","recHGfNvb9jyZjCtK","reckTib0bc9tEeLP5","recbs85UQ9I7p1lPH","recJCFtrHFL8XAiky","rec9hqMSFFf9amZsV","rec7TMHgvWKd8LnyX","recs8nTuAojMYMtme","reczvrRVpyOi7Uyv3","recAY5lbeQnWa1Qay","recz7C30xidPW6Hha","recB9GxeqOZ8Dhf0D","recptBGO9fnxlH7p1","recXYQSgJnU5nQPcB","rec96fgenU0Xsx1az","reczha28mwkx9N9vO","recb3bAIZf8UwfI7H","recambMfTVJjX3iWw","recd1kHCCYeCKVo1M","recw2a9q2D9Lxn4g8","recWxARcN28uLyEL1","recAvXZnEqMXtMjOu","recElKumHB1RqS08o","reclNxEyY78tbDeNX","rec0T91h1zJjV2jJn","rec9xq1AhPWzQMLWB","rec4pxut8OsGh2ZjK","recD6uGSFgwQ9SpPi","reco1RJcaeujvYSKd","recaLgloJKP91iPfs","rec0NSDVNfBQm0fDz","recMN29wYdVovPizL","recg8UyXLMPK20h9V","recMOfqiXqpit0T9W","recXDLpEOwpUD9Yq5","recjmhw2j00W6XOcD","reciWaOz7A4TU23ja","recWsokPXFWeYWJf7","recFM6CbazCPCYFVr","recj0Hn55nqgzr5x1","rechzz6zasOCwFIQV","recTNuq41PyUekgVx","recXeSXXEDK4VIS3o","recdXl06Awy89vZYq","rec9c4GatGFb6LAkd","recwfDtvotS0HzBgB","rec83IvAOep3IlgyA","rec1Sd2BpyK5JZIqd","recT8aTjl3BfGHGJf","recJnnZGZx9SrwmU2","rec4n8aBxlBr5hRXc","recgavroCEcNsqsxH","reck6C8kKXPvmdQoA","recVgcIcslgcImXG1","recLP1Ya2JAPHp5Cb","recA3HKecaE2TfKoW","rec1Kixcw6j2NDYh0","recnX2iL316GVCcl5","recVkNHDZTvW6V2dR","recprZgTBY3IFckEc","reciFT1V4Ay0Nu1XZ","recf5U8zHXRrbItlY","recRw3Rxp4FWPvypD","rec5pz6kuUTiBbt9O","recUJDF75oxR3G1JY","recU6EKv6u8ZCyClH","recYkmiII4M49lpQ4","rec2qDIhxZPc2j8RH","reco1PFrql9hmptoZ","recGvVgivKZzsM9mn","recM1NebX76C74CzD","recntRqalxUf8GRjw","recq8vf28OvETlfqS","recvvaW9QBe7Pb5ea","recNtazRWS89XSXQx","recyGATDaXarG64eJ","recyKy8PziSxMg29C","receOwUxOkIeiR1Mr","recIrWYa5xsGCtpvE","recEiJFKNrZE5SVGp","recpPf2GKIidbpJ2t","recoJJumXTxuOJKJ2","recAr99425Fw9f8YC","rect7ui9ep1eVBkyF","receuWQ6Gsu4r2QmV","recH4XiMmEzwwNjKQ","recAAvfwpst9aUdg8","reckys28gsM87JMhD","receMgTvnOd2MtwOF","recMULiMFc1dBYuTl","recP4IR3nf134t0Yw","recJBUVKjvrBOBSys","rec0h7rHKUNkK8U3l","recSq6c2zChKBp3TZ"],"chaptersWritten":["recQ9L6sfa0CWf8GS","recxGczDPGWmecQhD","recCm2DWE3zKDSnJ1","rec0nurYuJScaN1Xi","recl2ItLxseNwJRqk","recWaMEHcqDRNxgIo","recfQ8vCYCPM1Zdhb","rec20qS21pdPP0YOx","recQolu4nVFcQwaNu","recDiLa8pD4kXHSUE","rec37SscfGTcRZyPr","rec16GvK7rfcDDD90","recGZVAf1dpNuAwnv","recTQOrWohkuTwqMn","recpPAfBFsb9QaZvG","recXrEbk8Tb5ahtRa","recGggvPu1ZVfu3CK","recvOx9iCL04DxdIy","recGxBXncllL5Q3MO","recBow8zJvd7y8Gxl","recS3PS3TEvu38Pnx","recPjfSkXwKJVsj3O","recuSi5JM3aBCwdAQ","rectMQStHirhCXsHq","recbpPunqiVGYg68O","rec9G8e7trKJtRjM0","recOuyxAS0aVmC8lJ","reczjujwxrh8eGN7Q","rec9KLfZ9FcD5xgLC","recp2OAUBOLF8iv1R","reczy0VRwGTx2fhWg","recQVapu1YbDIGQkK","recn4ESCpiFjeGaCY","recCwWU2x9oqa7qV0","rec19LeyEFCspmg5N","recNe61jMqnQQN5Uv","rec7zUq70fRZRqKkZ","rec3c7IhC4KhsMTgv","recbYwKbnIF7B8ChW","recfF7oyCct4wk1Vr","rec1pbtWyuJC3Y4Mn","recM8Xcv3bOUIUGjX","recQysI0lNoep8ViB","recn9sbuzqAtgp8Sz","rec5uQ21R6khWQCBJ","recz5YuUwXOcvSKpd","recjFkRD3A4uTw8VM","rec1GIDeWkCJCMQog","recKW8aYmsXfGBlgv","recFvp51LbEPe4XdA","rec4YEhKFmRlzzcii","recWYkw342whJqETl","recbIZ8kf3DjLkkYB","recuLJkFTWWowElfi","recFL2pSSEhKJbqAt","reciWX0ICsL42Vc4p","recs6afL1V306fZC7","recOLetFBdjHedmIM","recQdMktfczEFobAL","recAQW86u4vcbE7SK","recPwVqEptXm6JilW","recSh1Wtk3yALG8di","recrX0JvZsQiVwNva","recBzsKYJgF3fBBQD","recp5v6ficixJUyyU","recsAWtM801mXxPiJ","recqxpqRX1OtlmF04","recet9fjVH2WyS5sg","recRTadhSLiiWH8fM","reclFwXrPVnfsrLHQ","recz1arTM9CQhDhy0","recieeGmwbblVWK8u","rec2gO0taCNMj3JfF","recMJ7MRpni7UXKmU","recjElnpq4OHmM2Do","recQqOX8KU2CUQJ4h","recgJTFGfHqCf3mHe","recnHwQqhX95SNP1r","recTZ1b4y4SDS80zJ","recDQBURWk06n8iqB"],"mother":["Hannah"],"father":["Elkanah 2"],"children":["Abijah 3","Joel 1"],"displayTitle":"Samuel","status":"publish","alsoCalled":"Shemuel","eastons":["rechCngecnzOZkN0z"],"verseCount":122,"minYear":-1165,"maxYear":64,"alphaGroup":"S","slug":"samuel_2469","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["Heard of God.

Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Kish (probably his only son, and a child of prayer, “asked for”), of the tribe of Benjamin, the first king of the Jewish nation. The singular providential circumstances connected with his election as king are recorded in [1 Sam. 8](/1sam#1Sam.8)-10. His father’s she-asses had strayed, and Saul was sent with a servant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah (10:5, “the hill of God,” A.V.; lit., as in R.V. marg., “Gibeah of God”), Saul and his servant went toward the north-west over Mount Ephraim, and then turning north-east they came to “the land of Shalisha,” and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and at length came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel’s home at Ramah (9:5-10). At this point Saul proposed to return from the three days’ fruitless search, but his servant suggested that they should first consult the “seer.” Hearing that he was about to offer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and “behold, Samuel came out against them,” on his way to the “bamah”, i.e., the “height”, where sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul’s question, “Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is,” Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming (9:15-17), and received Saul as his guest. He took him with him to the sacrifice, and then after the feast “communed with Saul upon the top of the house” of all that was in his heart. On the morrow Samuel “took a vial of oil and poured it on his head,” and anointed Saul as king over Israel (9:25-10:8), giving him three signs in confirmation of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home in Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God came upon him, and “he was turned into another man.” The simple countryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkable change suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and the people said in their astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”, a saying which passed into a “proverb.” (Comp. 19:24.)\n\n The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown to the people. The “anointing” had been in secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must be confirmed by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn assembly “before the Lord” at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn (10:17-27), and it fell upon Saul, and when he was presented before them, the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was rent for the first time in Israel by the loud cry, “God save the king!” He now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a kind of bodyguard, “a band of men whose hearts God had touched.” On reaching his home he dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of his former life.\n\n Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the Ammonite at Jabeshgilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribes of Israel rallied at his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a great army to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite invaders at Jabesh (11:1-11). Amid the universal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel “all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal.” Samuel now officially anointed him as king (11:15). Although Samuel never ceased to be a judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to an end.\n\n Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeing the land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and for this end he gathered together an army of 3,000 men ([1 Sam. 13:1](/1sam#1Sam.13.1), [2](/1sam#1Sam.13.2)). The Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men, occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly without any direction from his father “smote” the Philistines in Geba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and “people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude,” encamped in Michmash, which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for seven days in Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel had appointed (10:8); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, as it was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not waited long enough (13:13, 14).\n\n When Saul, after Samuel’s departure, went out from Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to that number (13:15), against the Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a pomegrante tree at Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady esSuweinit alone intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested, uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with his armour-bearer planned an assault against the Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army (14:1-15). Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into the wady, and on their hands and knees climbed to the top of the narrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of the Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of the Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistines was thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. “It was a very great trembling;” a supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men, a band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines, and the tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfway between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totally routed. “So the Lord saved Israel that day.” While pursuing the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, “Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening.” But though faint and weary, the Israelites “smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon” (a distance of from 15 to 20 miles). Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb which was abundant there (14:27). This was afterwards discovered by Saul (ver. 42), and he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed, saying, “There shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground.” He whom God had so signally owned, who had “wrought this great salvation in Israel,” must not die. “Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place” ([1 Sam. 14:24-46](/1sam#1Sam.14.24)); and thus the campaign against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul’s second great military success.\n\n Saul’s reign, however, continued to be one of almost constant war against his enemies round about (14:47, 48), in all of which he proved victorious. The war against the Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at length ([1 Sam. 15](/1sam#1Sam.15)). These oldest and hereditary ([Ex. 17:8](/exod#Exod.17.8); [Num. 14:43-45](/num#Num.14.43)) enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the south and south-west of Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to execute the “ban” which God had pronounced ([Deut. 25:17-19](/deut#Deut.25.17)) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. The cup of their iniquity was now full. This command was “the test of his moral qualification for being king.” Saul proceeded to execute the divine command; and gathering the people together, marched from Telaim ([1 Sam. 15:4](/1sam#1Sam.15.4)) against the Amalekites, whom he smote “from Havilah until thou comest to Shur,” utterly destroying “all the people with the edge of the sword”, i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty of rebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and in conniving at his soldiers’ sparing the best of the sheep and cattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordan valley, said unto him, “Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected thee from being king” (15:23). The kingdom was rent from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the Lord chose to be Saul’s successor, and whom Samuel anointed (16:1-13). From that day “the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.” He and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of the schools of the prophets.\n\n David was now sent for as a “cunning player on an harp” ([1 Sam. 16:16](/1sam#1Sam.16.16), [18](/1sam#1Sam.16.18)), to play before Saul when the evil spirit troubled him, and thus was introduced to the court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the king. At length David returned to his father’s house and to his wonted avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three years. The Philistines once more invaded the land, and gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah. Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped on the northern slope of the same valley which lay between the two armies. It was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, the champion of the Philistines (17:4-54), an exploit which led to the flight and utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently into his service (18:2); but he became jealous of him (ver. 9), and on many occasions showed his enmity toward him (ver. 10, 11), his enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at different times he tried in vain to carry out.\n\n After some time the Philistines “gathered themselves together” in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul “gathered all Israel together,” and “pitched in Gilboa” ([1 Sam. 28:3-14](/1sam#1Sam.28.3)). Being unable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two of his retinue, betook himself to the “witch of Endor,” some 7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startling communication that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel (ver. 16-19), who appeared to him. “He fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel” (ver. 20). The Philistine host “fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa” (31:1). In his despair at the disaster that had befallen his army, Saul “took a sword and fell upon it.” And the Philistines on the morrow “found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.” Having cut off his head, they sent it with his weapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the family sepulchre at Zelah ([2 Sam. 21:13](/2sam#2Sam.21.13), [14](/2sam#2Sam.21.14))."],"modified":"2020-10-30T16:45:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recqpdBK0N5U5Gchx","fields":{"personLookup":"sceva_2480","personID":2480,"name":"Sceva","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","dictionaryLink":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/sceva.html","dictionaryText":" an implement, a Jew, chief of the priests at Ephesus (  Acts 19:13-16  ); i.e., the head of one of the twenty-four courses of the house of Levi.

Among these was Hezekiah, who had entered into an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. He accordingly led a very powerful army of at least 200,000 men into Judea, and devastated the land on every side, taking and destroying many cities ([2 Kings 18:13-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13); comp. [Isa. 22](/isa#Isa.22), [24](/isa#Isa.24), [29](/isa#Isa.29), and [2 Chr. 32:1-8](/2chr#2Chr.32.1)). His own account of this invasion, as given in the Assyrian annals, is in these words: “Because Hezekiah, king of Judah, would not submit to my yoke, I came up against him, and by force of arms and by the might of my power I took forty-six of his strong fenced cities; and of the smaller towns which were scattered about, I took and plundered a countless number. From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, asses and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape...Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and divers treasures, a rich and immense booty...All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government.” (Comp. [Isa. 22:1-13](/isa#Isa.22.1) for description of the feelings of the inhabitants of Jerusalem at such a crisis.)\n\n Hezekiah was not disposed to become an Assyrian feudatory. He accordingly at once sought help from Egypt ([2 Kings 18:20-24](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.20)). Sennacherib, hearing of this, marched a second time into Palestine ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17), [37](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.37); 19; [2 Chr. 32:9-23](/2chr#2Chr.32.9); [Isa. 36:2-22](/isa#Isa.36.2). [Isa. 37:25](/isa#Isa.37.25) should be rendered “dried up all the Nile-arms of Matsor,” i.e., of Egypt, so called from the “Matsor” or great fortification across the isthmus of Suez, which protected it from invasions from the east). Sennacherib sent envoys to try to persuade Hezekiah to surrender, but in vain. He next sent a threatening letter ([2 Kings 19:10-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.10)), which Hezekiah carried into the temple and spread before the Lord. Isaiah again brought an encouraging message to the pious king ([2 Kings 19:20-34](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.20)). “In that night” the angel of the Lord went forth and smote the camp of the Assyrians.

When David was returning to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, a strife arose between the ten tribes and the tribe of Judah, because the latter took the lead in bringing back the king. Sheba took advantage of this state of things, and raised the standard of revolt, proclaiming, “We have no part in David.” With his followers he proceeded northward.

While he lay asleep Jael crept stealthily up to him, and taking in her hand one of the tent pegs, with a mallet she drove it with such force through his temples that it entered into the ground where he lay, and “at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there he fell down dead.” The part of Deborah’s song ([Judg. 5:24-27](/judg#Judg.5.24)) referring to the death of Sisera (which is a “mere patriotic outburst,” and “is no proof that purer eyes would have failed to see gross sin mingling with Jael’s service to Israel”) is thus rendered by Professor Roberts (Old Testament Revision):\n\n “Extolled above women be Jael,  The wife of Heber the Kenite,  Extolled above women in the tent.  He asked for water, she gave him milk;  She brought him cream in a lordly dish.  She stretched forth her hand to the nail,  Her right hand to the workman’s hammer,  And she smote Sisera; she crushed his head,  She crashed through and transfixed his temples.  At her feet he curled himself, he fell, he lay still;  At her feet he curled himself, he fell;  And where he curled himself, there he fell dead.”"],"modified":"2020-07-11T17:56:01.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recfgjRO9XO8HY689","fields":{"personLookup":"sisera_2758","personID":2758,"name":"Sisera","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recrtXmkYYgq8vlrX","recAZnNJS495Mzrcs"],"displayTitle":"Sisera","status":"wip","Disambiguation (temp)":"Sisera (captivity of the exiles)","eastons":["recHwrft0gjNdBJT5"],"verseCount":2,"minYear":-445,"maxYear":-445,"alphaGroup":"S","slug":"sisera_2758","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The ancestor of some of the Nethinim who returned with Zerubbabel ([Ezra 2:53](/ezra#Ezra.2.53); [Neh. 7:55](/neh#Neh.7.55))."],"modified":"2020-07-11T17:55:49.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recUR8KYptP0X0GA4","fields":{"personLookup":"sister_of_tahpenes_2759","personID":2759,"name":"Sister of Tahpenes","gender":"Female","verses":["recukFm37rfA5uALY","reczUTT2SEEfrmcP8"],"siblings":["Tahpenes"],"children":["Genubath"],"displayTitle":"Sister of Tahpenes","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"sister","verseCount":2,"minYear":-984,"maxYear":-984,"alphaGroup":"S","slug":"sister_of_tahpenes_2759","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recnqwmQlchdVX96L","fields":{"personLookup":"so_2760","personID":2760,"name":"So","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["reclVXVjNp5mIE6pZ"],"displayTitle":"So","status":"wip","eastons":["recXCACJMeo1Bged3"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-725,"maxYear":-725,"alphaGroup":"S","slug":"so_2760","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["(Nubian, Sabako), an Ethiopian king who brought Egypt under his sway.

Shelomoh), David's second son by Bathsheba, i.e., the first after their legal marriage (  2�Samuel 12  ). He was probably born about B.C. 1035 (  1�Chronicles 22:5  ;   29:1  ). He succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood, probably about sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., \"beloved of the Lord\" (  2 Samuel 12:24   2 Samuel 12:25  ). He was the first king of Israel \"born in the purple.\" His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: \"Assuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me.\" His history is recorded in 1Kings 1-11 and 2Chr. 1-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father's death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah (  1�Kings 1:5-40  ). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the \"Augustan age\" of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages (  1�Kings 11:1-8  ;   1 Kings 14:21   1 Kings 14:31  ).    Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son (  1�Kings 2:1-9  ;   1�Chronicles 22:7-16  ;   28  ). As soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh (  1�Kings 3:1  ), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings. (See  HIRAM  .)   For some years before his death David was engaged in the active work of collecting materials (  1�Chronicles 29:6-9  ;   2  Chr.   2:3-7  ) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God (  1�Chronicles 22:8  ); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon. (See  TEMPLE  .)   After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel (  1�Kings 7:1-12  ). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the name of \"The House of the Forest of Lebanon.\" In front of this \"house\" was another building, which was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again was the \"Hall of Judgment,\" or Throne-room (  1�Kings 7:7  ;   10:18-20  ;   2  Chr   9:17-19  ), \"the King's Gate,\" where he administered justice and gave audience to his people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.    Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city (Eccl   2:4-6  ). He then built Millo (LXX., \"Acra\") for the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts around it (  1 Kings 9:15   1 Kings 9:24  ;   11:27  ). He erected also many other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies (  1�Kings 9:15-19  ;   2  Chr   8:2-6  ). Among his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military outpost.    During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations (  1�Kings 9:26-28  ;   1 Kings 10:11   1 Kings 10:12  ;   2  Chr   1 Kings 8:17   1 Kings 8:18  ;   9:21  ). This was the \"golden age\" of Israel. The royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon's court were unrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was \"thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl\" (  1 Kings 4:22   1 Kings 4:23  ).    Solomon's reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. \"He spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes\" (  1 Kings 4:32   1 Kings 4:33  ).    His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near \"to hear the wisdom of Solomon.\" Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was \"the queen of the south\" (  Matthew 12:42  ), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. \"Deep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety.\" (  1�Kings 10:1-13  ;   2  Chr   9:1-12  .) She was filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: \"there was no more spirit in her.\" After an interchange of presents she returned to her native land.    But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The bright day of Solomon's glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. \"As he grew older he spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built (  1�Kings 11:3  ), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon (  Judges 8:27  ), or the Danites (  Judges 18:30   Judges 18:31  ), but was downright idolatrous.\" (  1�Kings 11:7  ;   2  Kings   23:13  .)    This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him (  1 Kings 11:14-22   1 Kings 11:23-25   1 Kings 11:26-40  ), and one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and \"with him was buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel.\" \"He leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name.\"    \"The kingdom of Solomon,\" says Rawlinson, \"is one of the most striking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences.\", Historical

He was the first king of Israel “born in the purple.” His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: “Assuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me.” His history is recorded in [1 Kings 1](/1kgs#1Kgs.1)-11 and [2 Chr. 1](/2chr#2Chr.1)-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father’s death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah ([1 Kings 1:5-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.5)). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the “Augustan age” of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages ([1 Kings 11:1-8](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1); [14:21](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.21), [31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31)).\n\n Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son ([1 Kings 2:1-9](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.1); [1 Chr. 22:7-16](/1chr#1Chr.22.7); [28](/1chr#1Chr.28)). As soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh ([1 Kings 3:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.1)), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings.\n\n For some years before his death David was engaged in the active work of collecting materials ([1 Chr. 29:6-9](/1chr#1Chr.29.6); [2 Chr. 2:3-7](/2chr#2Chr.2.3)) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God ([1 Chr. 22:8](/1chr#1Chr.22.8)); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon.\n\n After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel ([1 Kings 7:1-12](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.1)). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the name of “The House of the Forest of Lebanon.” In front of this “house” was another building, which was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again was the “Hall of Judgment,” or Throne-room ([1 Kings 7:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.7); [10:18-20](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.18); [2 Chr. 9:17-19](/2chr#2Chr.9.17)), “the King’s Gate,” where he administered justice and gave audience to his people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.\n\n Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city ([Eccl. 2:4-6](/eccl#Eccl.2.4)). He then built Millo (LXX., “Acra”) for the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts around it ([1 Kings 9:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15), [24](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.24); 11:27). He erected also many other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies ([1 Kings 9:15-19](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15); [2 Chr. 8:2-6](/2chr#2Chr.8.2)). Among his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military outpost.\n\n During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations ([1 Kings 9:26-28](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26); [10:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.11), [12](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.12); [2 Chr. 8:17](/2chr#2Chr.8.17), [18](/2chr#2Chr.8.18); 9:21). This was the “golden age” of Israel. The royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon’s court were unrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was “thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl” ([1 Kings 4:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.22), [23](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.23)).\n\n Solomon’s reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. “He spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes” ([1 Kings 4:32](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.32), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.33)).\n\n His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near “to hear the wisdom of Solomon.” Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was “the queen of the south” ([Matt. 12:42](/matt#Matt.12.42)), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. “Deep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety.” ([1 Kings 10:1-13](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.1); [2 Chr. 9:1-12](/2chr#2Chr.9.1).) She was filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: “there was no more spirit in her.” After an interchange of presents she returned to her native land.\n\n But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The bright day of Solomon’s glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. “As he grew older he spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built ([1 Kings 11:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.3)), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon ([Judg. 8:27](/judg#Judg.8.27)), or the Danites ([Judg. 18:30](/judg#Judg.18.30), [31](/judg#Judg.18.31)), but was downright idolatrous.” ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13).)\n\n This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him ([1 Kings 11:14-22](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.14), [23-25](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.23), [26-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.26)), and one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and “with him was buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel.” “He leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name.”\n\n “The kingdom of Solomon,” says Rawlinson, “is one of the most striking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences.”, Historical

He consolidated and organized his conquests on a large scale. He subdued Northern Syria and Hamath, and the kings of Syria rendered him homage and paid him tribute. His ambition was to found in Western Asia a kingdom which should embrace the whole civilized world, having Nineveh as its centre. Menahem, king of Israel, gave him the enormous tribute of a thousand talents of silver, “that his hand might be with him” ([2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19); [1 Chr. 5:26](/1chr#1Chr.5.26)). The fact that this tribute could be paid showed the wealthy condition of the little kingdom of Israel even in this age of disorder and misgovernment.

We know nothing of his father but that he was a Greek ([Acts 16:1](/acts#Acts.16.1)). He is first brought into notice at the time of Paul’s second visit to Lystra (16:2), where he probably resided, and where it seems he was converted during Paul’s first visit to that place ([1 Tim. 1:2](/1tim#1Tim.1.2); [2 Tim. 3:11](/2tim#2Tim.3.11)). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his “own son in the faith,” arranged that he should become his companion ([Acts 16:3](/acts#Acts.16.3)), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist ([1 Tim. 4:14](/1tim#1Tim.4.14)), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea ([Acts 17:14](/acts#Acts.17.14)). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica (17:15; [1 Thess. 3:2](/1thess#1Thess.3.2)). We next find him at Corinth ([1 Thess. 1:1](/1thess#1Thess.1.1); [2 Thess. 1:1](/2thess#2Thess.1.1)) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus ([Acts 19:22](/acts#Acts.19.22)), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia (20:4), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him ([Phil. 1:1](/phil#Phil.1.1)), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment ([Heb. 13:23](/heb#Heb.13.23)). During the apostle’s second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments ([2 Tim. 4:13](/2tim#2Tim.4.13)).

Only four of these courses or “families” of the priests returned from the Exile ([Ezra 2:36-39](/ezra#Ezra.2.36)); but they were then re-distributed under the old designations. The priests served at the temple twice each year, and only for a week each time. Zacharias’s time had come for this service. During this period his home would be one of the chambers set apart for the priests on the sides of the temple ground. The offering of incense was one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who should have this great honour, an honour which no priest could enjoy more than once during his lifetime.\n\n While Zacharias ministered at the golden altar of incense in the holy place, it was announced to him by the angel Gabriel that his wife Elisabeth, who was also of a priestly family, now stricken in years, would give birth to a son who was to be called John, and that he would be the forerunner of the long-expected Messiah ([Luke 1:12-17](/luke#Luke.1.12)). As a punishment for his refusing to believe this message, he was struck dumb and “not able to speak until the day that these things should be performed” (20). Nine months passed away, and Elisabeth’s child was born, and when in answer to their inquiry Zacharias wrote on a “writing tablet,” “His name is John,” his mouth was opened, and he praised God (60-79). The child (John the Baptist), thus “born out of due time,” “waxed strong in spirit” (1:80)."],"modified":"2021-01-06T20:48:09.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recLdATro2BBFgSJa","fields":{"personLookup":"zacharias_3011","personID":3011,"name":"Zacharias","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recdv0EPNN0TnEOa0","recBMkYUIxC7cK5wU","recXBXTnxBmFU4Xbb"],"father":["Jehoiada 2"],"displayTitle":"Zacharias","status":"wip","alsoCalled":"Zechariah","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Zechariah (son of Jehoiada)","eastons":["recvdx3WcLQPOFg9h"],"verseCount":3,"minYear":-842,"maxYear":33,"alphaGroup":"Z","slug":"zacharias_3011","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son or grandson of Jehoiada, the high priest in the times of Ahaziah and Joash.

prophet of Judah, the eleventh of the twelve minor prophets. Like Ezekiel, he was of priestly extraction. He describes himself (1:1) as “the son of Berechiah.” In [Ezra 5:1](/ezra#Ezra.5.1) and 6:14 he is called “the son of Iddo,” who was properly his grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second year of Darius (B.C. 520), about sixteen years after the return of the first company from exile. He was contemporary with Haggai ([Ezra 5:1](/ezra#Ezra.5.1)).\n\n His book consists of two distinct parts, (1) chapters 1 to 8, inclusive, and (2) 9 to the end. It begins with a preface (1:1-6), which recalls the nation’s past history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions (1:7-6:8), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action, the crowning of Joshua (6:9-15), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God’s Christ.\n\n Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be any longer kept, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God’s presence and blessing.\n\n The second part of the book (ch. 9-14) bears no date. It is probable that a considerable interval separates it from the first part. It consists of two burdens.\n\n The first burden (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God’s providential dealings with his people down to the time of the Advent.\n\n The second burden (ch. 12-14) points out the glories that await Israel in “the latter day”, the final conflict and triumph of God’s

He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the brother of Jehoahaz ([2 Kings 23:31](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.31); [24:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.17), [18](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.18)). His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet “he did evil in the sight of the Lord” ([2 Kings 24:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.19), [20](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.20); [Jer. 52:2](/jer#Jer.52.2), [3](/jer#Jer.52.3)). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, “with all his host” ([2 King 25:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.1)), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, “every worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God’s fury to the dregs” ([2 Kings 25:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.3); [Lam. 4:4](/lam#Lam.4.4), [5](/lam#Lam.4.5), [10](/lam#Lam.4.10)). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (B.C. 588) to Babylon ([2 Kings 25:1-7](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.1); [2 Chr. 36:12](/2chr#2Chr.36.12); [Jer. 32:4](/jer#Jer.32.4), [5](/jer#Jer.32.5); 34:2, 3; 39:1-7; 52:4-11; [Ezek. 12:12](/ezek#Ezek.12.12)), where he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.\n\n After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land ([Jer. 52:16](/jer#Jer.52.16)). Gedaliah, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah, ruled over Judah ([2 Kings 25:22](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.22), [24](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.24); jer. 40:1, 2, 5, 6)."],"modified":"2020-10-30T19:50:27.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recCrIW9D4Qzh5zff","fields":{"personLookup":"zedekiah_3029","personID":3029,"name":"Zedekiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recpVwfoZFpFbLXtD","rec71mXM2HSRkq7zH","recVpoTw2FJrpEo8M","recpaEykcG2yjjN6x","rec9Swe2chqgPVcXx"],"father":["Chenaanah 2"],"displayTitle":"Zedekiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Zedekiah(son of Kenaanah)","eastons":["recKfSV2GEIOQUGbk"],"verseCount":5,"minYear":-897,"maxYear":-588,"alphaGroup":"Z","slug":"zedekiah_3029","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Chenaanah, a false prophet in the days of Ahab ([1 Kings 22:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.11), [24](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.24); [2 Chr. 18:10](/2chr#2Chr.18.10), [23](/2chr#2Chr.18.23))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recRNkRmTCTCbcGVw","fields":{"personLookup":"zedekiah_3030","personID":3030,"name":"Zedekiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","memberOf":["reciI2noa29XOlF3E"],"verses":["recEjVcBsjGUVrsXb"],"siblings":["Jecamiah(no entry)","Hoshama(no entry)","Malchiram(no entry)","Nedabiah","Pedaiah 2","Shealtiel","Shenazar(no entry)"],"father":["Jehoiachin"],"displayTitle":"Zedekiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Zedekiah (Jehoiachin)","verseCount":1,"minYear":-1053,"maxYear":-1053,"alphaGroup":"Z","slug":"zedekiah_3030","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recBialedQuyBn3jJ","fields":{"personLookup":"zedekiah_3031","personID":3031,"name":"Zedekiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recUQL6q6QV1afTOA","rectAyr1SKhCfNo7f"],"father":["Maaseiah(no entry)"],"displayTitle":"Zedekiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"zedekiah (son of Shaphan)","verseCount":2,"minYear":-599,"maxYear":-599,"alphaGroup":"Z","slug":"zedekiah_3031","Easton's Count":0,"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recOYSO3eyz8CG0lg","fields":{"personLookup":"zedekiah_3032","personID":3032,"name":"Zedekiah","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recFA7T8bprJuN8wx"],"father":["Hananiah 5"],"displayTitle":"Zedekiah","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation (temp)":"Zedekiah (son of Hananiah)","eastons":["rec5PMJrj0KsjmMgV"],"verseCount":1,"minYear":-606,"maxYear":-606,"alphaGroup":"Z","slug":"zedekiah_3032","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The son of Hananiah, a prince of Judah in the days of Jehoiakim ([Jer. 36:12](/jer#Jer.36.12))."],"modified":"2019-07-27T11:49:43.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recE9JL6NWRxMRIWP","fields":{"personLookup":"zeeb_3033","personID":3033,"name":"Zeeb","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recoWiKzPl7eacsJu","recOvYgx5rvQO9F6i","recdgHjW12yUhaLGv"],"displayTitle":"Zeeb","status":"publish","eastons":["rectpNIzfBEr6jsoi"],"verseCount":3,"minYear":-1245,"maxYear":-1245,"alphaGroup":"Z","slug":"zeeb_3033","Easton's Count":1,"dictText":["The wolf, one of the two leaders of the great Midianite host which invaded Israel and was utterly routed by Gideon.

It received its name from the “first-born” of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ([Gen. 10:15](/gen#Gen.10.15), [19](/gen#Gen.10.19)). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a “great” city ([Josh. 11:8](/josh#Josh.11.8); [19:28](/josh#Josh.19.28)). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ([Judg. 1:31](/judg#Judg.1.31)). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel ([Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12)). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its “virgin daughter” ([Isa. 23:12](/isa#Isa.23.12)), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel ([1 Kings 11:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.33)). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6); [1 Chr. 22:4](/1chr#1Chr.22.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8)). It is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa. 23:2](/isa#Isa.23.2), [4](/isa#Isa.23.4), [12](/isa#Isa.23.12); [Jer. 25:22](/jer#Jer.25.22); [27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3); [47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8); [28:21](/ezek#Ezek.28.21), [22](/ezek#Ezek.28.22); [32:30](/ezek#Ezek.32.30); [Joel 3:4](/joel#Joel.3.4)). Our Lord visited the “coasts” of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), [Matt. 15:21](/matt#Matt.15.21); [Mark 7:24](/mark#Mark.7.24); [Luke 4:26](/luke#Luke.4.26); and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ([Mark 3:8](/mark#Mark.3.8); [Luke 6:17](/luke#Luke.6.17)). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ([Acts 27:3](/acts#Acts.27.3), [4](/acts#Acts.27.4)).\n\n This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a “king of the Sidonians,” probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, “the goddess of the Sidonians.” In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians."],"modified":"2020-05-17T01:54:23.000Z"},"createdTime":"2018-03-19T00:26:39.000Z"},{"id":"recaxRuD7J2stdTED","fields":{"personLookup":"ziha_3078","personID":3078,"name":"Ziha","isProperName":true,"gender":"Male","verses":["recKIvJO5iYLV85fx","reccgbYT4WDLQNwck"],"displayTitle":"Ziha","status":"wip","ambiguous":true,"Disambiguation
