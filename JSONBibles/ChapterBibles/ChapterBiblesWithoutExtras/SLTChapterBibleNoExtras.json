{"Gen.1":"[1]In the beginning God formed the heavens and the earth.[2]And the earth was desolation and emptiness, and darkness over the face of the deep: and the spirit of God moved over the face of the waters.[3]And God will say there shall be light, and there shall be light.[4]And God will see the light that it is good, and God will separate between the light and between the darkness.[5]And God will call to the light day, and to the darkness he called night: and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be one day.[6]And God will say there shall be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and there shall be a separating between waters to waters.[7]And God shall make a firmament, and he shall separate between the waters which are from the lower part of the firmament and between the waters which are from the upper part of the firmament: and it shall be so.[8]And God will call to the firmament the heavens: and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the second day.[9]And God will say the waters shall be gathered together from the under part of the heavens to one place, and the dry shall be seen: and it shall be so.[10]And God will call to the dry, earth; and to the gathering of the waters he called seas: and God will see that it is good.[11]And God will say the earth shall bring forth the tender grass, and the green herb bearing seed, and the fruit tree making fruit according to its kind, in which is the seed in it upon the earth: and it shall be so.[12]And the earth shall bring forth the tender grass, the green herb bearing seed according to its kind, and the tree making fruit in which the seed is in it, according to its kind: and God will see that it is good.[13]And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the third day.[14]And God will say there shall be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate between the day and between the night: and they shall be for signs and for set times, and for days and for years.[15]And they shall be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth: and it shall be so.[16]And God will make two great lights; the great light for the rule of the day, and the small light for the rule of the night and the stars.[17]And God will give them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.[18]And to rule in the day and in the night, and to separate between the light and between the darkness: And God will see that it is good.[19]And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the fourth day.[20]And God will say the waters shall breed abundantly creeping things, the living soul, and birds shall fly over the earth, over the face of the firmament of the heavens.[21]And God will form great sea monsters and every living soul creeping, which the waters bred abundantly according to their kind, and every bird of wing according to its kind: and God will see that it is good.[22]And God will praise them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and birds shall multiply in the earth.[23]And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the fifth day.[24]And God will say, the earth shall bring forth the living soul according to its kind, cattle and creeping things, and living things of the earth after its kind: and it shall be so.[25]And God will make the living thing of the earth according to its kind, and cattle according to its kind, and every creeping thing of the earth according to its kind: and God will see that it is.[26]And God will say, We will make man in our image according to our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and every creeping thing creeping upon the earth.[27]And God will form man in his image, in the image of God he formed him; male and female he formed them.[28]And God will praise them, and God will say to them, be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing creeping upon the earth.[29]And God will say, Lo, I gave to you every green herb scattering seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree scattering seed; to you it shall be for food.[30]And to every living thing of the earth, and to all the birds of the heavens and to every thing creeping upon the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food: and it shall be so.[31]And God will see every thing which he made: and lo, very good and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the sixth day.","Gen.2":"[1]And the heavens and the earth shall be completed and all their army.[2]And God will complete in the seventh day his work which he made, and he will rest in the seventh day from all his work which he made.[3]And God will praise the seventh day, and will consecrate it, because in it he ceased from all his works which God formed to make.[4]These the generations of the heavens and the earth in creating them, in the day of Jehovah God’s making the earth and the heavens.[5]And every green thing of the field before it shall be in the earth, and every green herb of the field before it will spring up: for Jehovah God rained not upon the earth and not a man to work the earth.[6]And a vapor shall go up from the earth and it watered all the face of the earth.[7]And Jehovah God will form man of the dust from the earth, and will blow into his nostrils the breath of lives, and man shall be for a living soul.[8]And Jehovah God will plant a garden in Eden from the east; and he will put there the man which he will form.[9]And Jehovah God will cause to grow out of the earth every tree pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of lives in the midst of the garden, and the tree to know good and evil.[10]And a river shall go out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it shall be separated into four heads.[11]The name of the one, Pison: it is that surrounding all the land Havilah, where there is gold.[12]And the gold of that land is good. There bdellium and onyx stone.[13]And the name of the second river, Gihon: that surrounding all the land of Cush.[14]And the name of the third river, Hiddekel, that going forth east of Assyria. And the fourth river, Euphrates.[15]And Jehovah God will take the man and will set him down in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.[16]And Jehovah God will appoint to the man, saying, From every tree of the garden eating, thou shalt eat.[17]But from the tree to know good and evil thou shalt not eat from it, for in the day of thy eating from it, dying, thou shalt die.[18]And Jehovah God will say, It is not good for man to be alone; I will make for him a help as before him.[19]And Jehovah God will form out of the earth every living thing of the field, and all the birds of the heavens, and he will bring in to the man to see what he will call to it; and all which the man will call it to the living soul, that its name.[20]And the man will call the names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field; but to the man was not found a help as before him.[21]And Jehovah God will cause to fall a deep sleep upon the man, and he will sleep; and he will take one of his ribs and will close up the flesh underneath it.[22]And Jehovah God will build the rib which he took from the man, into a woman, and will bring her to the man.[23]And the man will say, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; and this shall be called woman, because she was taken from man.[24]Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will cleave to his woman; and they shall be into one flesh.[25]And they two shall be naked, the man and his woman, and they shall not be ashamed.","Gen.3":"[1]And the serpent was crafty above every beast of the field which Jehovah God made; and he will say to the woman, Is it because God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?[2]And the woman will say to the serpent, From the fruit of the tree of the garden we shall eat.[3]And from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat from it, and ye shall not touch upon it, lest ye shall die.[4]And the serpent will say to the woman, Dying ye shall not die.[5]For God is knowing in the day of your eating from it, and your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.[6]And the woman will see that the tree is good for food, and that it is a desire to the eyes, and a tree desired to make wise; and she will take from its fruit and will eat, and will give also to her man with her, and he will eat.[7]And the eyes of the two shall be opened, and they shall know that they are naked; and they shall sew together the leaves of the fig tree, and shall make to themselves girdles.[8]And they shall hear the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden at the breeze of the day: and Adam and his wife will hide from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the wood of the garden.[9]And Jehovah God will call to the man, and will say to him, Where art thou?[10]And he will will say, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I shall be afraid, because I am naked, and I will hide myself.[11]And he will say, Who showed to thee that thou art naked? Of the tree which I charged thee not to eat, didst thou eat from it?[12]And the man will say, The woman which thou gavest with me, she gave to me from the tree, and I shall eat.[13]And Jehovah God will say to the woman, What is this thou didst? And the woman will say, The serpent deceived me and I shall eat.[14]And Jehovah God will say to the serpent, Because thou didst this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust thou shalt eat all the days of thy life.[15]And I will put enmity between thee and between the woman, and between thy seed and between her seed; it shall lie in wait for thee as to the head, and thou shalt lie in wait for him as to the heel.[16]To the woman he said, Multiplying, I will multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and to thy husband thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.[17]And to Adam he said, Because thou didst listen to the voice of thy wife, and thou wilt eat from the tree which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat from it; cursed the earth for thy sake; in labor shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;[18]And thorns and weeds shall it cause to sprout forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the green herb of the field.[19]In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat food until thy turning back to the earth; for out of it thou wert taken; for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou turn back.[20]And Adam will call his wife’s name Life, for she was the mother of all living.[21]And Jehovah God will make to Adam and to his wife, coats of skin, and will clothe them.[22]And Jehovah God will say, Lo, Adam became as one from us, to know good and evil: and now lest he shall send forth his hand and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity:[23]And Jehovah God will send him forth from the garden of Eden to work the earth which he was taken from there.[24]And he will drive out Adam; and he will set up from the east of the garden of Eden, cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning itself about to keep the way of the tree of lives.","Gen.4":"[1]And Adam knew Life, his wife, and she will conceive and bear Cain, and said, I obtained a man of Jehovah.[2]And she will add to bear his brother Abel; and Abel shall be a feeder of sheep, and Cain was a laborer of the earth.[3]And it shall be at the end of days, and Cain shall bring in from the fruit of the earth an offering to Jehovah.[4]And Abel, he also brought in the first-born of his sheep, and their fat. And Jehovah will look to Abel and to his gift.[5]And to Cain and to his offering he looked not: and Cain will be very angry, and his countenance will fall.[6]And Jehovah will say to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why does thy countenance fall?[7]If thou shalt do well thou shalt be lifted up; and if thou shalt not do well, sin lies at the entrance; and to thee his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.[8]And Cain will speak to Abel his brother; and it shall be in their being in the field, Cain will rise up against Abel his brother, and will kill him.[9]And Jehovah will say to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? and he will say, I know not: am I my brother’s watcher?[10]And he will say, What didst thou? the voice of thy brother’s bloods, crying out to me from the earth.[11]And now cursed art thou, from the earth, which opened her mouth to take thy brother’s bloods from thy hand.[12]When thou shalt work the earth she shall not add to give her strength to thee. Wandering and fleeing shalt thou be in the earth.[13]And Cain will say to Jehovah, My sin is great, above bearing.[14]Lo, thou didst drive me out this day from above the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be wandering and fleeing in the earth; and it shall be, every one finding me will kill me.[15]And Jehovah will say to him, Therefore, every one killing Cain, he shall be avenged seven fold. And Jehovah will put a sign upon Cain, lest any finding him, smite him.[16]And Cain went out from the face of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, eastward of Eden.[17]And Cain will know his wife, and she will conceive and bear Enoch: and he will be building a city, and will call the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.[18]And to Enoch shall be born Irad; and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methusael; and Methusael begat Lamech.[19]And Lamech shall take to him two women: the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.[20]And Adah will bear Jabal; he was the father of him remaining in the tent, and riches.[21]And his brother’s name Jubal; he was father of all laying hold of the harp and pipe.[22]And Zillah, she also will bear Tubal Cain, sharpening every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.[23]And Lamech will say his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and give ear to my word: for I killed a man to my wound, and a son to my cutting.[24]If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, also Lamech seventy and seven.[25]And Adam will know his wife again, and she will bear a son, and she will call his name Seth: for God set me a second seed instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.[26]And to Seth, to him also a son shall be born, and he will call his name Enos: then it was begun to call in the name of Jehovah.","Gen.5":"[1]This the writing of the generations of Adam: in the day God formed Adam, in the likeness of God, he made him.[2]Male and female he formed them;

And Isaak will go to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.[2]And Jehovah will be seen to him, and will say, Thou shalt not go down to Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall say to thee.[3]Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee, for to thee and to thy seed will I give all these lands; and I established the oath which I sware to Abraham thy father.[4]And I will increase thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and I will give to thy seed all these lands: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be praised.[5]Because that Abraham listened to my voice, and he will watch my watches, my commands, my statutes, and my precepts.[6]And Isaak dwelt in Gerar.[7]And the men of the place will ask concerning his wife; and he will say, She is my sister: for he will be afraid to say, My wife, lest the men of the place will kill me for Rebekah, because she is good in appearance.[8]And it was when the days there were long to him, and Abimelech king of the Philistines shall bend forward through the window, and will see, and behold, Isaak playing with Rebekah his wife.[9]And Abimelech will call to Isaak, and will say, Surely, behold, she thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaak will say to him, Because I said, Lest I shall die for her.[10]And Abimelech will say, What this thou didst to us? nearly one of the people lay with thy wife, and thou broughtest blame upon us.[11]And Abimelech will command all the people, saying, He touching this man and his wife, dying, shall die.[12]And Isaak will sow in that land, and will find in that year a hundred measures; and Jehovah will praise him.[13]And the man will become great, and went going, and he became great, until that he became very great.[14]And there will be to him possession of flocks, and possession of oxen, and service of many; and the Philistines will envy him.[15]And all the wells which his father’s servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them and filled them with dust.[16]And Abimelech will say to Isaak, Go from us: for thou wert strong above us exceedingly.[17]And Isaak will go from thence, and will sit down in the valley of Gerar, and will dwell there.[18]And Isaak will dwell, and he will dig the wells of waters which they digged in the days of Abraham his father; and the Philistines will stop them after Abraham died: and he will call them the names after the names which his father called them.[19]And Isaak’s servants will dig in the valley and will find there a well of waters.[20]And the shepherds of Gerar will contend with Isaak’s shepherds, saying; The waters are to us: and he will call the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.[21]And they will dig another well, and will strive for that also: and he will call its name Sitnah.[22]And he will remove from thence, and will dig another well; and they strove not for that: and he will call its name Rehoboth; and he will say, For now Jehovah made wide for us, and made us fruitful in the earth.[23]And he will go up from thence to the well of the oath.[24]And Jehovah will be seen to him in that night, and will say, I am the God of Abraham thy father: thou shalt not be afraid, for I am with thee, and I praised thee, and I increased thy seed, for sake of Abraham my servant.[25]And he will build an altar there, and will call on the name of Jehovah, and will stretch out there his tent: and there Isaak’s servants will dig a well.[26]And Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol, leader of his army.[27]And Isaak will say to them, Wherefore came ye to me, and ye hated me, and will send me away from you?[28]And they will say, Seeing we saw that Jehovah was with thee: and we will say, There shall be an oath between us, between us and between thee, and we will make a covenant with thee.[29]Wilt thou do evil to us as that we touched thee not, as that we did to thee only good, and we sent thee away in peace, thou now art praised of Jehovah.[30]And he will make to them a drinking, and they will eat and drink.[31]And they will rise early in the morning, and they will swear, a man to his brother, and Isaak will send them away and they will go from him in peace.[32]And it shall be in that day, and Isaak’s servants will come and announce to him concerning the well which they digged, and they will say to him, We found water.[33]And he will call it oath: for this the name of the city the well of the oath till this day.[34]And Esau will be the son of forty years, and he will take a wife, Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemah, daughter of Elon the Hittite.[35]And they will be bitterness of spirit to Isaak and to Rebekah.","Gen.27":"[1]And it shall be as Isaak grew old, and his eyes shall be weak for seeing, and he will call Esau his son the great, and he will say to him, My son: and he will say to him, Behold me.[2]And he will say, Behold now, I grew old; I knew not the day of my death.[3]Therefore take now, thy weapon, thy quiver and thy bow, and go forth to the field and hunt for me a hunting.[4]And make for me dainties as that I loved, and bring it to me, and eating, that my soul shall praise thee before I shall die.[5]And Rebekah heard in the speaking of Isaak to Esau his son: and Esau went to the field to hunt, a hunting, to bring.[6]And Rebekah spake to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speaking to Esau thy brother, saying,[7]Bring to me a hunting, and make for me dainties, and eating, and I will praise thee before Jehovah, before my death.[8]And now my son, hear to my voice, according to that I command thee.[9]Go now to the flocks, and take to me from thence two kids of the she-goats good, and I will make them dainties for thy father, as that he loved.[10]And thou shall bring to thy father, and eating, so that he will praise thee before his death.[11]And Jacob will say to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother a man of hair, and I a smooth man:[12]Perhaps my father will feel me, and I was in his eyes as mocking; and I brought a curse and not a praise.[13]And his mother will say to him, Upon me thy curse my son; only hear to my voice, and go take to me.[14]And he will go, and will take, and bring to his mother: and his mother will make dainties as that his father loved.[15]And Rebekah will take desirable covering of Esau her son, the great, which was with her in the house, and will put upon Jacob her son, the small.[16]And the nakedness of the skins of the shegoats, she put upon his hands and upon the smoothness of his neck.[17]And she will give the dainties, and the bread which she made, into the hand of Jacob her son.[18]And he will go to his father and will say, My father. And he will say, Behold me; who thou my son?[19]And Jacob will say to his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I did according to that thou spakest to me: arise, now, sit and eat from my hunting, so that thy soul shall praise me.[20]And Isaak will say to his son, How this, thou wert quick to find my son? and the will say, Because Jehovah thy God caused to meet before me.[21]And Isaak will say to Jacob, Come near, now, and I shall feel thee, my son, if thou this my son Esau or not.[22]And Jacob will come near to Isaak his father, and he will feel him, and he will say, The voice, the voice of Jacob; and the hands, the hands of Esau.[23]He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau’s hands. So he blessed him.[24]And he will say, Thou this my son Esau? and he will say, I.[25]And he will say, Bring near to me, and eating of my son’s hunting, so that my soul shall praise thee. And he will bring near to him and he will eat: and he will bring wine to him, and he will drink.[26]And Isaak his father will say to him, Come near, now, and kiss me, my son.[27]And he will come near, and will kiss him: and he will smell the smell of his garment, and he will bless him, and he will say, See, the smell of my son as the smell of a field which Jehovah praised.[28]And God will give to thee from the dew of the heavens, and from the fatness of the earth, and a multitude of corn and new wine.[29]And nations shall serve thee, and peoples shall bow down to thee; be lord over thy brother, and thy mother’s sons shall bow down to thee: cursed he cursing thee, and blessed he praising thee.[30]And it shall be after that Isaak finished to praise Jacob, and it shall be Jacob going will but go out from the face of Isaak his father, and Esau his brother came from his hunting.[31]And he also will make dainties, and will bring to his father; and he will say to his father, Will my father rise and eat from his son’s hunting, that thy soul shall bless me?[32]And Isaak his father will say to him, Who art thou?

For he said, I will appease his face with the gift going before me, and after this I will see his face; perhaps he will receive my face.[21]And the gift will pass over before his face, and he remained in that night in the camp.[22]And he will rise in that night and take his two wives and his two maids, and his eleven sons, and he will pass over the passage of Jabbok.[23]And he will take them and will cause them to pass through the torrent, and he will cause to pass through what is to him.[24]And Jacob will be left alone by himself, and a man will wrestle with him till the ascending of the morning.[25]And he will see that he will not prevail over him and he will touch upon the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh will be alienated in his wrestling with him.[26]And he will say, Send me away, for the morning ascended: and he will say, I will not send thee away, unless thou didst bless me.[27]And he will say to him, What thy name? and he will say, Jacob.[28]And he will say, Thy name shall no more be said Jacob, but Israel, for thou wert a prince with God and with men, and thou shalt prevail.[29]And Jacob will ask and will say, Announce now, thy name: and he will say, For what this thou wilt ask for my name? and he will bless him there.[30]And Jacob will call the name of the place, the face of God: for I saw God lace to face, and my soul shall be saved.[31]And the sun will rise to him when he passed through the face of God, and he limped upon his thigh.[32]For this, the sons of Israel will not eat the sinew which dried up which is upon the hollow of the thigh, even till this day; for he touched upon the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew which dried up.","Gen.33":"[1]And Jacob will lift up his eyes and will see, and behold Esau came, and with him four hundred men.

and he will remove the gad-fly from Pharaoh, and from his servants, and from his people; not one was left over.[32]And Pharaoh will make his heart heavy also in this time; he sent not forth the people.","Exod.9":"[1]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and speak to him, Thus said Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Send forth my people and they shall serve me.[2]For if thou refusest to send forth, but yet thou holdest fast upon them,[3]Behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field; upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen and upon the sheep: death exceedingly heavy.[4]And Jehovah separated between the cattle of Israel and between the cattle of Egypt: and nothing shall die from all the sons of Israel, spoken of.[5]And Jehovah will set an appointment, saying, To-morrow Jehovah will do this word in the land.[6]And Jehovah will do this word in the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt will die: and from the cattle of the sons of Israel, not one died.[7]And Pharaoh will send, and behold, from the cattle of Israel, there died not even one And the heart of Pharaoh will be heavy, and he sent not forth the people.[8]And Jehovah will say to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you your two fists full of ashes of the furnace; and Moses sprinkled it towards the heavens in the eyes of Pharaoh.[9]And it was for dust upon all the land of Egypt, and it was upon man, and upon quadruped for a burning sore breaking forth with pustules over all the land of Egypt.[10]And they will take ashes of the furnace and will stand before Pharaoh; and Moses will sprinkle it towards the heavens; and it will be a burning sore, breaking forth with pustules upon man and upon quadruped.[11]And the sacred scribes will not be able to stand before Moses on account of the burning sore: for the burning sore was upon the sacred scribes, and in all Egypt.[12]And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he heard not to them: as Jehovah spake to Moses.[13]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Send forth my people, and they shall serve me.[14]For in this time I send all my plagues into thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: so that thou shalt know that there is not as I in all the earth.[15]For now I sent forth my hand, and surely I will smite thee and thy people with death; and thou shalt be destroyed from the earth.[16]And yet for this I raised thee up in order to cause thee to see my strength; and for the sake of declaring my name in all the earth.[17]As yet lifting up thyself against my people not to send them forth?[18]Behold, I rain at this time to-morrow, hail exceedingly heavy, which was not as this in Egypt from the day it was founded even now.[19]And now send forth to secure thy cattle, and all which is to thee in the field: every man and quadruped which shall be found in the field, and shall not be gathered together to the house, and the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.[20]He fearing the word of Jehovah from the servants of Pharaoh, caused his servants to flee, and his cattle to the houses.[21]Whoever didn’t respect the word of Yahweh left his servants and his livestock in the field.[22]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward the heavens, and there shall be hail upon all the land of Egypt, upon man and upon quadruped, and upon the green herb of the field in the land of Egypt.[23]And Moses will stretch forth his rod towards the heavens, and Jehovah gave voices, and hail; and fire will go upon the earth: and Jehovah will rain hail upon the land of Egypt.[24]And there will be hail and fire taking hold in the midst of the hail, exceedingly heavy, which was not as this upon all the land of Egypt from the time it was for a nation.[25]And the hail will strike in all the land of Egypt, all which is in the field, from man, and even to quadruped, and every green herb of the field; the hail smote and broke in pieces every tree of the field.[26]Only in the land of Goshen, there were the sons of Israel, was no hail.[27]And Pharaoh will send and call for Moses and for Aaron, and will say to them, I sinned this time: Jehovah is just, and I and my people unjust.[28]Pray ye to Jehovah and much, from there being voices of God and hail; and I will send you forth, and ye shall not add to stand.[29]And Moses will say to him, When I have gone forth from the city, I will spread forth my hands to Jehovah; the voices shall cease, and the hail shall be no more; for thou shalt know that to Jehovah is the earth.[30]And thou and thy servants, I knew that ye will not yet fear from before Jehovah God.[31]And the flax and the barley were struck: for the barley was ripe, and the flax high.[32]And the wheat and spelt were not struck, for they were late.[33]And Moses will go forth from Pharaoh out of the city, and he will spread forth his hands to Jehovah, and the voices will cease; and the hail and the rain was not poured upon the earth.[34]And Pharaoh will see that the rain ceased, and the hail and the voices; and he will add to sin, and he will make his heart heavy, he and his servants.[35]And Pharaoh’s heart will be bound fast, and he sent not forth the sons of Israel; as Jehovah spake by the hand of Moses.","Exod.10":"[1]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to Pharaoh: for I made his heart heavy, and the heart of his servants; for sake of my setting these my signs within him.[2]And that thou shalt recount in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what I performed in Egypt, and my signs which I set up among them; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.[3]And Moses will come, and Aaron, to Pharaoh, and they will say to him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Until long didst thou refuse to humble thyself from before me. Send forth my people and they shall serve me.[4]For if thou refusest to send forth my people, behold me bringing to-morrow the locust into thy bounds.[5]And it covered the eye of the earth, and he shall not be able to see the earth: and it shall eat the remainder of that escaping, being left to you from the hail; and it shall eat every tree springing up to you out of the field.[6]And they filled thy houses and all the houses of thy servants, and the houses of all Egypt; which thy fathers saw not, and thy fathers’ fathers, from the day they were upon the earth, even till this day. And he will turn away and go forth from Pharaoh.[7]And Pharaoh’s servants will say to him, How long will this, be to us for a snare? Send forth the men, and they shall serve Jehovah their God, before thou shalt know that Egypt is destroyed.[8]And he will turn back Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh, and he will say to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God: who and who are they going.[9]And Moses will say, With our youths and with our old men will we go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and with our oxen will we go: for a festival of Jehovah is to us.[10]And he will say to them, So will Jehovah be with you, as I will send you forth, and your little ones: see ye, for evil is manifest before you.[11]Not so: go now, ye men, and serve Jehovah; for this ye yourselves were seeking. And he will drive them out from before Pharaoh.[12]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt, with the locust, and it will come up upon the land of Egypt; and it shall eat every green herb of the land, all which the hail left.[13]And Moses will stretch forth his rod upon the land of Egypt, and Jehovah drove an east wind upon the earth, all that day and all the night: it was morning, and the east wind raised up the locust.[14]And the locust will come up upon all the land of Egypt, and it will rest in all the bounds of Egypt exceeding many: before it was there no locust thus like it, and after it, it shall not be thus.[15]And it will cover the eye of all the earth, and the land will be dark; and it will eat every green herb of the land, and all the fruit of the tree which the hail left: and not a green thing was left in the tree, and in the green herb of the field, in all the land of Egypt.[16]And Pharaoh will hasten to call for Moses and for Aaron; and he will say, I sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.[17]And at this time take away now my sin, only this time, and pray ye to Jehovah your God, and he will remove from me only this death.[18]And he will go forth from Pharaoh, and will pray to Jehovah.[19]And Jehovah will turn a wind of the sea, exceedingly strong, and he will take away the locust and will drive it into the sea of sedge: not one locust remained in all the bounds of Egypt.[20]And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he sent not forth the sons of Israel.[21]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards the heavens, and darkness shall be upon the land of Egypt, and the darkness shall be felt.[22]And Moses will stretch forth his hand toward the heavens, and there shall be thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.[23]They saw not a man his brother, and they rose not up each from his lower part, three days: and to all the sons of Israel there was light in their dwellings.[24]And Pharaoh will call to Moses, and will say, Go ye, serve Jehovah: only your sheep and your oxen shall be left; also your little ones shall go with you.[25]And Moses will say, Thou also shalt give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and we sacrificed to Jehovah our God.[26]And also our cattle shall go with us; a hoof shall not be left; for from us we shall take to serve Jehovah our God; and we shall not know what we shall serve Jehovah till we come there.[27]And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he not being willing to send them forth.[28]And Pharaoh will say to him, Go from me, watch to thyself; thou shalt not add to see my face, for in the day of thy seeing my face thou shalt die.[29]And Moses will say, Thou spakest well: I will no more add to see thy face.","Exod.11":"[1]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Yet one blow will I bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; after this he will send you forth from here; when his sending forth to go, driving, he will drive you out from here.[2]Speak now in the ears of the people; they shall ask each from his friend, and a woman from her friend, vessels of silver and vessels of gold.[3]And Jehovah will give favor to the people in the eyes of the Egyptians: also the man Moses was exceedingly great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the eyes of the people.[4]And Moses will say, Thus said Jehovah, About the middle of the night I will go forth into the midst of Egypt.[5]And every first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maid which is behind the two mill-stones; and every first-born of quadruped.[6]And a great cry was in all the land of Egypt, such as was not, and such shall not be added.[7]And against all the sons of Israel, a dog shall not sharpen his tongue, from man and even to cattle: so that ye shall know that Jehovah will separate between Egypt and between Israel.[8]And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and worship to me, saying, Go forth, thou, and all the people which are at thy feet: and after this I will go forth. And he will go forth from Pharaoh in the heat of anger.[9]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Pharaoh will not hear to you; so that my wonders be multiplied in the land of Egypt.[10]And Moses and Aaron did all these signs before Pharaoh; and Jehovah will bind fast Pharaoh’s heart, and he sent not forth the sons of Israel from his land.","Exod.12":"[1]And Jehovah will say to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,[2]This month is to you the beginning of months: this to you the first month of the year.[3]Speak ye to all the assembly of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month and they shall take to them each a sheep, according to the house of the fathers; a sheep for a house.[4]And if the house shall be little from being for a sheep, and he taking, and his neighbor drawing nigh his house according to the number of souls; each according to the mouth of his eating shall ye reckon for the sheep.[5]A perfect sheep, a male, the son of a year, shall be to you from the he-lambs and from the goats ye shall take.[6]And it shall be to you for a preservation till the fourteenth day of this month; and they shall slaughter it, all the convocation of the assembly of Israel, between the two evenings.[7]And they took from the blood and gave upon the two door-posts, and upon the lintel within the houses which they shall eat it in them.[8]And they shall eat the flesh in that night roasted with fire and unleavened; upon bitter herbs shall they eat it.[9]Ye shall not eat from it raw and boiled from boiling with water, but roasted with fire, its head with its legs with its inner part.[10]Ye shall not leave from it till morning: and that remaining from it till morning, ye shall burn with fire.[11]And so shall ye eat it, your loins girded, your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand: and ye ate it in hasty flight; a passing over to Jehovah.[12]And I passed over in the land of Egypt in this night, and I struck every first-born in the land of Egypt from man even to quadruped: and against all the gods of Egypt I will do judgments: I Jehovah.[13]And the blood was to you for a sign upon the houses where you are there: and I saw the blood and I passed over you, and the blow shall not be upon you to destroy, in my striking upon the land of Egypt.[14]And this day shall be to you for a remembrance; and ye kept it a festival to Jehovah for your generations: ye shall keep a festival a law forever.[15]Seven days ye shall eat unleavened; wholly in the first day shall ye turn away leaven in your houses; for all eating leavened and that soul was destroyed from Israel from the first day even to the seventh day.[16]And in the first day a calling of holiness, and in the seventh day a calling of holiness shall be to you; every service shall not be done in them only what shall be eaten by every soul; this only shall be done by you.[17]And ye watched the unleavened; for in this self-same day I brought forth your armies out of the land of Egypt and watch ye this day for your generations a law forever.[18]In the first, in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened till the one and twentieth day of the month in the evening.[19]Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses; for all eating from the leavened, that soul shall be destroyed from the assembly of Israel, for the sojourner or for the native of the land.[20]All leavened ye shall not eat: in all your dwellings ye shall eat unleavened.[21]And Moses will call for all the old men of Israel and he will say to them, Draw out and take to yourselves a sheep according to your tribes, and slaughter the passing over.[22]And take ye a bundle of hyssop, and dip in the blood that is upon the threshhold, and touch upon the lintel, and upon the two door-posts from the blood which is upon the threshhold and ye shall not come forth each from the door of his house till morning.[23]And Jehovah passed over to strike the Egyptians; and he saw the blood upon the lintel, and upon the two doorposts, and Jehovah passed by the door and will not give him destroying to come in to your houses to strike.[24]And watch ye this word for a law to thee and to thy sons forever.[25]And it shall be when ye shall come to the land which Jehovah will give to you, as he spake, watch ye this service.[26]And it shall be when your sons shall say to you, What this service to you?[27]And they said, This the sacrifice of the passing over to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt in his striking the Egyptians, and he delivered our houses. And the people will bow down and will worship.[28]And the sons of Israel will go, and will do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; thus did they.[29]And it will be in the middle of the night, and Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting upon his throne, to the first-born of the captive which is in the house of the pit; and every first-born of the cattle.[30]And Pharaoh will rise up in the night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there will be a great cry in Egypt: for not a house where there was not the dead there.[31]And he will call for Moses and for Aaron by night, and he will say, Arise, go forth from the midst of my people, also ye, also the sons of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah as ye spake.[32]Also your sheep, also your oxen take as ye spake, and go and bless also me.[33]And Egypt will be strong upon the people to hasten to send them forth out of the land; for they said, We are all dying.[34]And the people will take up their dough before it will be leavened, their kneading-bowls bound in their garments upon their shoulders.[35]And the sons of Israel did as Moses spake: and they will ask of the Egyptians, silver vessels and gold vessels, and garments.[36]And Jehovah gave favor to the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they will lend them; and they will strip the Egyptians.[37]And the sons of Israel will remove from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand footmen; men apart from the little ones.[38]And also a great mixture went up with them; and sheep and oxen, very much cattle.[39]And they will cook the dough which they brought out of Egypt unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for they were driven out of Egypt, for they could not linger, and also they made not for themselves food.[40]And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they dwelt in Egypt, was thirty years and four hundred years.[41]And it will be from the end of thirty years and four hundred years, in this self-same day all the armies of Jehovah will go forth out of the land of Egypt.[42]This a night of watchings to Jehovah, for bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt: it is this night to Jehovah of watching to all the sons of Israel for their generations.[43]And Jehovah will say to Moses and Aaron, This the law of the passing over: every son of a stranger shall not eat of it.[44]And every servant of a man bought with silver, and thou hast circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.[45]The sojourner and the hireling shall not eat of it.[46]In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not bring forth out of the house from the flesh without, and ye shall not break a bone of it.[47]All the assembly of Israel shall do it.[48]And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and do the passing over to Jehovah, all the males to him being circumcised, and then he shall draw near to do it; and he was as a native of the land: and every one uncircumcised shall not eat of it.[49]One law shall be to the native and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of you.[50]And all the sons of Israel will do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.[51]And it will be in this self-same day, Jehovah brought forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their armies.","Exod.13":"[1]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[2]Consecrate to me every first-born bursting open every womb among the sons of Israel, of man and of cattle: it is to me.[3]And Moses will say to the people, Remember this day which ye came forth out of Egypt, out of the house of servants; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you forth from here: and leavened shall not be eaten.[4]The day ye came forth in the month of Abib.[5]And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee forth to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware to thy fathers to give to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; and do thou this service in this month.[6]Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened, and in the seventh day a festival to Jehovah.[7]Unleavened shall be eaten seven days: and leavened shall not be seen to thee in all thy bounds.[8]And announce to thy son in this day, saying, For this Jehovah did to me in my coming out of Egypt.[9]And it was to thee for a sign upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes; so that the law of Jehovah shall be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought thee forth out of Egypt.[10]And watch this law according to its appointment from days to days.[11]And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee to the land of the Canaanites, as he sware to thee and to thy fathers, and he gave it to thee.[12]And thou madest pass over all bursting open the womb, to Jehovah; and every one bursting forth young of the quadruped which shall be to thee; the males are to Jehovah.[13]And every first-born of the ass, thou shalt redeem with a sheep; and if thou shalt not redeem, thou shalt break his neck: and every first-born of man among thy sons thou shalt redeem.[14]And it was when thy son shall ask thee to-morrow, saying, What this? and thou saidst to him, With strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt from the house of servants.[15]And it shall be when Pharaoh was hard to send us forth, and Jehovah will kill every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man to the firstborn of cattle; for this I sacrifice to Jehovah all bursting forth the womb, the males; and all the first-born of my sons I will redeem.[16]And it was for a sign upon thy hand, and for bands between thine eyes: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought us forth from Egypt.[17]And it shall be in Pharaoh’s sending forth the people, and God directed not the way of the land of the Philistines, for it is near; for God said, Lest the people shall grieve in their seeing war, and they turn back to Egypt.[18]And God will turn the people about the way of the desert, the sea of sedge: and the sons of Israel went up active out of the land of Egypt.[19]And Moses will take the bones of Joseph with him: for swearing he caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying, For reviewing, God will review you; and carry up my bones with you from here.[20]And they will remove from Succoth, and they will encamp in Etham, in the extremity of the desert.[21]And Jehovah went before them the day in a pillar of cloud, to direct them the way; and the night in a pillar of fire to give light to them; to go the day and the night.[22]And the pillar of cloud will not give way, the day, and the pillar of fire, the night, before the people.","Exod.14":"[1]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[2]Speak to the sons of Israel, and they shall turn back and shall encamp before the mouth of Hahiroth, between Migdol and between the sea, before Baal-Zephon: before them shall ye encamp by the sea.[3]And Pharaoh will say concerning the sons of Israel, They are wandering in perplexity in the land; the desert closed upon them.[4]And I bound fast Pharaoh’s heart, and he pursued after them; and I will be honored in Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they will do so.[5]And it was announced to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh will be turned, and his servants, against the people, and they will say, What this we did, that we sent forth Israel from serving us?[6]And he will harness his chariot, and he took his people with him.[7]And he will take six hundred chosen chariots, and all the horsemen of Egypt, and rulers over them all.[8]And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he will pursue after the sons of Israel: and the sons of Israel went forth with a high hand.[9]And the Egyptians will pursue after them, and they will enclose them, having encamped by the sea; all the horse, the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army, by the mouth of Hahiroth, before Baal-Zephon.[10]And Pharaoh drew near, and the sons of Israel will lift up their eyes, and behold, Egypt encamped behind them; and they will be exceedingly afraid: and the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah.[11]And they will say to Moses, Because no tombs are in Egypt, didst thou take us to die in the desert? what this thou didst to us to bring us forth out of Egypt?[12]Is not this the word which we spake to thee in Egypt, saying, Desist from us, and we will serve the Egyptians? For it is good to us to serve Egypt rather than that we died in the desert.[13]And Moses will say to the people, Ye shall not fear; stand ye and see the deliverance of Jehovah, which he will do to you this day: for the Egyptians whom ye saw this day, ye shall not add to see them more forever.[14]Jehovah will wage war for you and ye shall be silent.[15]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Why wilt thou cry to me? speak to the sons of Israel and they shall remove.[16]And thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and break it up: and the sons of Israel shall go in the midst of the sea on dry land.[17]And I, behold me binding fast the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall go after them: and I will be honored in Pharaoh, and upon all his army, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen.[18]And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah in the getting me honor in Pharaoh, in his chariots and in his horsemen.[19]And the messenger of God going before the camp of Israel will remove, and will go from behind them; and the pillar of the cloud will remove from before them, and will stand from behind them,[20]And it will come between the camp of Egypt and between the camp of Israel; and it will be the cloud, and the darkness, and it will make the night light: and this drew not near to this all the night.[21]And Moses will stretch forth his hand over the sea, and Jehovah will cause the sea to go by a strong east wind all the night; and he will set the sea for dry land, and the waters will be rent.[22]And the sons of Israel will go in the midst of the sea on dry land; and the waters to them a wall from their right hand and from their left.[23]And the Egyptians will pursue and will go after them, all the horse of Pharaoh and his chariots and his horsemen to the midst of the sea.[24]And it will be in the watch of the morning, Jehovah will look forth to the camp of Egypt in the pillar of fire and the cloud, and he will disturb the camp of Egypt.[25]And he will remove the wheel of their chariots, and they will drive in heaviness; and Egypt will say, I will flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah waged war for them against Egypt.[26]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and the waters shall turn back upon Egypt, upon its chariots and upon its horsemen.[27]And Moses will stretch forth his hand over the sea, and the sea will turn back before the morning to its perpetuity. And the Egyptians fled at meeting it, and Jehovah will shake off Egypt in the midst of the sea.[28]And the waters will turn back, and will cover the chariots and the horsemen, to all Pharaoh’s army coming after them into the sea: and there was not left among them even one.[29]And the sons of Israel came upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were to them a wall from the right hand and from the left.[30]And Jehovah will save Israel in that day, from the hand of Egypt: and Israel will see the Egyptians dead upon the lip of the sea.[31]And Israel will see the great hand which Jehovah did upon Egypt; and the people will fear Jehovah, and they will believe in Jehovah, and in Moses his servant.","Exod.15":"[1]Then will Moses sing, and the sons of Israel, this song to Jehovah; and they will speak, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, for exalting himself, he was exalted: the horse and his horsemen he threw into the sea.[2]Jehovah my strength and song, and he shall be to me for salvation: this my God, and I will cause him to rest; the God of my father, and I will exalt him.[3]Jehovah, a man of war: Jehovah his name.[4]The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he threw into the sea; his chosen rulers sank in the sea of sedge.[5]The depths will cover them: they will go down into the deep as a stone.[6]Thy right hand, Jehovah, was magnified in strength: thy right hand, Jehovah, will break in pieces the enemy.[7]And in the multitude of thy majesty thou wilt destroy those rising up against thee: thou wilt send forth thine anger; it shall eat them as straw.[8]And by the spirit of thine anger the waters shook them off, the flowings stood up as a heap: the depths were contracted in the heart of the sea.[9]The enemy said, I will pursue, I will enclose, I will divide the spoil: my soul shall be filled with them: I will draw out my sword, my hand shall dispossess them.[10]Thou didst blow with thy spirit; the sea covered them: they rolled down as lead in the great waters.[11]Who like thee among the gods, O Jehovah? who like thee magnified in in holiness, wonderful in praise, doing a wonder?[12]Thou didst stretch forth thy right hand, the earth will swallow them.[13]Thou didst lead in thy kindness this people thou didst redeem: thou didst conduct with thy strength to thy holy dwelling.[14]The peoples heard, and they will be angry: pain took those inhabiting Philistia.[15]Then the chiefs of Edom trembled; the mighty of Moab, trembling, shall take them; all those dwelling in Canaan melted away.[16]Dread shall fall upon them and terror: by the greatness of thine arm they shall be dumb as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Jehovah: till this people pass over, thou didst buy.[17]Thou shalt bring them in and shalt plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, into the place of thy Sabbath, thou didst make, O Jehovah: a holy place, O Jehovah, which thy hands prepared.[18]Jehovah shall reign forever and yet.[19]For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen, into the sea, and Jehovah will turn back over them the water of the sea: and the sons of Israel went on the dry land in the midst of the sea.[20]And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, will take the drum in her hand; and all the women will go forth after her, with drums and with lutes.[21]And Miriam will sing to them, Sing ye to Jehovah; for being lifted up, he was lifted up: the horse and his horseman he threw into the sea.[22]And Moses will remove Israel from the sea of sedge, and they will come forth to the desert of Shur; and they will go three days into the desert, and they found not water.[23]And they will come to Marah, and they will not be able to drink the waters of Marah, for they are bitter: for this he called the name bitterness.[24]And the people will murmur against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?[25]And he will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will show him a tree, and he will cast into the waters, and the waters will become sweet: then he set to him a law and judgment, and there he tried him.[26]And he will say, If hearkening thou wilt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and thou wilt do the right in his eyes, and give ear to his commands, and watch all his laws, every disease which I put upon Egypt I will not put upon thee: for I am Jehovah healing thee.[27]And they will come to Ailam; and twelve fountains of water there, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.","Exod.16":"[1]And they will remove from Ailam, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel will come to the desert of Sin, which is between Ailam and between Sinai, the fifteenth day of the second month of their coming out of the land of Egypt.[2]And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the desert.[3]And the sons of Israel will say to them, Who will give to die by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt in our sitting by the pot of flesh, in our eating bread to satiety? for ye brought us forth to this desert to kill all this convocation with hunger.[4]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold me raining for you bread from the heavens; and the people shall go forth and shall gather the word of a day in its day, so that I shall try them, whether they will go in my law or not.[5]And it was in the sixth day, and they prepared what they shall bring in; and it was double to what they will gather day by day.[6]And Moses will say, and Aaron, to all the sons of Israel, The evening, and ye knew that Jehovah brought you out of the land of Egypt:[7]And the morning, and ye saw the glory of Jehovah, in his hearing your murmurings against Jehovah and what are we that ye will murmur against us?[8]And Moses will say, In Jehovah giving you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety; in Jehovah hearing your murmurings which ye murmured against him: and what are we? not against us your murmurings but against Jehovah.[9]And Moses will say to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, Come near before Jehovah: for he heard your murmurings.[10]And it shall be as Aaron spake to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and they will turn to the desert, and behold, the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud.[11]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[12]I heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye knew that I am Jehovah your God.[13]And it shall be in the evening, the quail shall come up and shall cover the camp: and in the morning the dew was lying round about the camp.[14]And the dew lying will go up, and behold, upon the face of the desert a small thing being peeled off thin, as pitch upon the earth.[15]And the sons of Israel will see, and they will say, each to his brother, What this?

And Moses will say to them, Why will ye contend with me, and why will ye tempt Jehovah?[3]And the people will thirst there for water; and the people will murmur against Moses, and will say, For what this did ye bring us up out of Egypt to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?[4]And Moses will cry to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? yet a little and they will stone me.[5]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Pass over before the people and take with thee from the old men of Israel; and thy rod which thou didst strike with it the river, take in thy hand and go.[6]And behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and strike upon the rock, and waters shall come forth from it, and the people drank.

aromatics and pure frankincense: it shall be part for part.[35]And make it a perfume, an ointment, a work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy.[36]And pound fine from it to small dust, and give from it before the testimony in the tent of appointment where I will meet with thee there: holy of holies, shall it be to you.[37]And the perfume which thou shalt make, according to its measure ye shall not make to you: it shall be holy to you for Jehovah.[38]A man who shall make like it to smell in it, and he shall be cut off from his people.","Exod.31":"[1]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, Saying,[2]See, I called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.[3]And I will fill him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work.[4]To meditate work of skill, to work in gold and in silver and in brass.[5]And in graving stone for filling up, and in graving wood, to work in all work.[6]And I, behold, I gave him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all the wise of heart I gave wisdom; and they shall make all which I commanded thee:[7]The tent of appointment, and the ark of testimony, and the cover which is upon it, and all the vessels of the tent,[8]And the table and its vessels, and the pure chandelier and all its vessels, and the altar of incense,[9]And the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the wash-basin and its base,[10]And the garments of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to be priests,[11]The oil of anointing, and the incense of aromatics for the holy place: according to all which I commanded thee they shall do.[12]And Jehovah will say to Moses, saying.[13]Speak thou to the sons of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths shall ye watch: for it is a sign between me and between you for your generations, to know that I am Jehovah consecrating you.[14]And watch ye the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. He profaning it, dying, shall die; for all doing work in it, and that soul shall be cut off from the midst of his people.[15]Six days shall work be done, and the seventh day the Sabbath, a holy rest to Jehovah: all doing work in the day of the Sabbath, dying, shall die.[16]And the sons of Israel shall watch the Sabbath to do the Sabbath for their generation, a covenant forever.[17]Between me and between the sons of Israel it is a sign forever: for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day he rested and he will be refreshed.[18]And he will give to Moses when he ceased to speak to him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone written by the finger of God.","Exod.32":"[1]And the people will see that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, and the people will assemble to Aaron, and will say to him, Arise, make to us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we shall not know what was to him.[2]And Aaron will say to them, Break off the gold ear-rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters, and bring to me.[3]And all the people will break off the gold ear-rings which are in their ears, and they will bring to Aaron.[4]And he will take from their hand, and will form it with a graver, and he will make it a molten calf: and they will say, These thy gods, Israel, who brought thee up from the land of Egypt.[5]And Aaron will see, and he will build an altar before it; and Aaron will call and say, A festival to Jehovah tomorrow.[6]And they will rise early early on the morrow, and they will raise up a burnt-offering, and they will bring near peace; and the people will sit down to eat and drink, and they will rise up to play.[7]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, Go, descend: for thy people were corrupted whom thou didst bring up out of the land of Egypt.[8]For they turned aside quickly from the way which I commanded them: they made for them a molten calf, and worship to it, and will sacrifice to it, and will say, These thy gods, Israel, which raised thee up out of the land of Egypt.[9]And Jehovah will say to Moses, I saw this people, and behold, it a people of a hard neck.[10]And thou be at rest to me, and my wrath shall kindle against them, and I will consume them: and I will make thee into a great nation.[11]And Moses will supplicate the face of Jehovah, his God, and will say, For what will thy wrath kindle against thy people which thou didst bring forth out of the land of Egypt by thy great power and with a strong hand?[12]Lest the Egyptians shall speak, saying, With evil he brought them forth to kill them in the mountains, and to finish them from the face of the earth. Turn back from the heat of thy wrath, and repent concerning evil towards thy people.[13]Remember Abraham, Isaak, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear to them by thyself, and thou wilt speak to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land which I said, I will give to your seed and they inherited forever.[14]And Jehovah repented concerning the evil which he spake to do to his people.[15]And Moses will turn and will go down from the mount, and the two tables of testimony in his hand: the tables were written from the two opposite sides; from hence and from thence they were written.[16]And the tables they the work of God, and the writing the writing of God, it being cut in the tables.[17]And Joshua will hear the voice of the people in making a loud noise, and he will say to Moses, A voice of war in the camp.[18]And he will say, Not the voice of the shouting of victory, and not the voice of the shouting of defeat: the voice of shouting I heard.[19]And it will be when he drew near to the camp, and he will see the calf and the lute: and the wrath of Moses will kindle, and he will cast the tables out of his hand, and he will break them under the mount.[20]And he will take the calf which they made, and will burn it in fire, and which he will crush even to small dust, and will scatter upon the face of the water, and will give the sons of Israel to drink.[21]And Moses will say to Aaron, What did this people to thee that thou didst bring upon it a great sin?[22]And Aaron will say, The wrath of my lord shall not kindle: thou knowest the people that it is in sin.[23]And they will say to me; Make to us gods which shall go before us: for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we knew not what was to him.[24]And I said to them, To whom is gold, he shall break it off. And they will give it to me, and I shall cast it into the fire and this calf will come out.[25]And Moses will see the people that it was uncovered (for Aaron uncovered it for overthrow among their enemies).[26]And Moses will stand in the gate of the camp, and will say, Who for Jehovah? to me.

And he turned back to the camp; and his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from the midst of the tent.[12]And Moses will say to Jehovah, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou madest not known to me whom thou wilt send with me. And thou saidst, I knew thee by name, and also thou didst find favor in mine eyes.[13]And now, if now I found grace in thine eyes, make known to me now thy way, and I shall know thee, so that I shall find grace in thine eyes: and see that thy people is this nation.[14]And he will say, My face and my rest shall go to thee.[15]And he will say to him, If thy face led them not, thou wilt not bring us up from here.[16]And in what shall it be known here that I found favor in thine eyes, I and thy people? Is it not in thy going with us? and we shall be distinguished, I and thy people, above all the people which are upon the face of the earth.[17]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Also this word which thou spakest, I will do: for thou didst find grace in mine eyes and I shall know thee by name.[18]And he will say, Cause me now to see thy glory.[19]And he will say, I will cause all my good to pass by before thee, and I called upon the name of Jehovah before thee; and I compassionated whom I will compassionate, and I pitied whom I will pity.[20]And he will say, Thou shalt not be able to see my face: for none shall see my face, and live.[21]And Jehovah will say, Behold, a place with me, and stand thou upon the rock.[22]And it was in the passing by of my glory, and I put thee in a cavern of the rock; and I hedged in with my hand upon thee till I passed by.[23]And I turned aside my hand, and thou sawest behind me: and they shall not see my face.","Exod.34":"[1]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Carve to thyself two tables of stones like as the first: and I wrote upon the tables the words which were upon the first tables which thou didst brake.[2]And be prepared at morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and stand by me there upon the head of the mount.[3]And no man shall come up with thee, and also a man shall not be seen in all the mountain: also the sheep and the cattle shall not feed before that mountain.[4]And he will carve the two tables of stones as the first; and Moses will rise early in the morning, and will go up to the mount Sinai as Jehovah commanded him, and he will take in his hand the two stone tables.[5]And Jehovah will come down in a cloud, and he will stand with him there, and will call upon the name of Jehovah.[6]And Jehovah will pass by before him, and Jehovah will call, Jehovah God merciful and compassionate, deferring anger, and much in kindness and truth,[7]Watching kindness for thousands, taking away iniquity, and transgression and sin, and acquitting, will not cleanse; striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and upon the sons’ sons, upon the third and the fourth.[8]And Moses will hasten and bow down to the earth, and will worship.[9]And he will say, If now I found grace in thine eyes, my lord, my lord will go now in the midst of us (for it is a people of a hard neck) and forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take possession of us.[10]And he will say, Behold, I make a covenant before all thy people: and I will do wonders which were not created in all the earth, and in all nations; and all the people where thou art among them saw the work of Jehovah: for it is a fearful thing which I do with thee.[11]Watch to thyself what I command thee this day: behold me driving out from before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.[12]Watch to thyself lest thou shalt make a covenant with those dwelling in the land which thou goest upon it, lest it shall be for a snare in the midst of thee.[13]For their altars thou shalt lay waste, and their pillars thou shalt break, and their images thou shalt cut off.[14]For thou shalt not worship another God: for Jehovah, his name is Jealous; he is a jealous God.[15]Lest thou shalt make a covenant to those dwelling in the land and they committed fornication after their gods, and sacrificed to their gods, and call to thee, and thou didst eat from his sacrifice;[16]And thou didst take from his daughters to thy sons, and they committed fornication after their gods, and they made thy sons commit fornication after their gods.[17]Thou shalt make to thee no molten gods.[18]The festival of unleavened thou shalt watch. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened, which I commanded thee, for the appointment of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou earnest forth out of Egypt.[19]All opening the womb is to me: all thy cattle, the male, the firstling of the ox or sheep.[20]And the first-born of the ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep: and if thou shalt not ransom, thou shalt break his neck.

Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother’s milk.[27]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Write to thyself these words; for upon the mouth of these words, I made a covenant with thee and with Israel.[28]And he will be there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he ate not bread and drank not water. And he will write upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words.[29]And it shall be in Moses’ coming down from the mount Sinai (and the two tables of testimony in.

for it is an error; and they brought their offering a sacrifice to Jehovah, and their sin before Jehovah, for their error.[26]And it was forgiven to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, to all the people in error.[27]And if one soul shall sin in error, and he brought a she goat the daughter of a goat, for sin.[28]And the priest expiated for the soul erring, in sinning in error before Jehovah, to expiate for him; and it was forgiven to him.[29]The native among the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, one law shall be to you, for doing in error.[30]And the soul which shall do with a high hand, from the native, and from the stranger, it reproaches Jehovah, and that soul was cut off from the midst of its people.[31]For it despised the word of Jehovah, and broke his command; being cut off, that soul shall be cut off; its iniquity upon it.[32]And the sons of Israel shall be in the desert, and they shall find a man gathering wood in the day of the Sabbath.[33]And they having found him, will bring him gathering wood to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the assembly.[34]And they will put him in watch, for it was not specified what shall be done to him.[35]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Dying, the man shall die: all the assembly stoned him with stones without the camp.[36]And all the assembly shall bring him forth without the camp, and they shall stone him with stones, and he shall die; as Jehovah commanded Moses.[37]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[38]Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, They made to them fringes of flowers upon the wings of their garment for their generations; and they gave upon the fringes of the wing a thread of cerulean purple;[39]And it was to you for fringes, and ye saw it, and ye remembered all the commands of Jehovah, and ye did them; and ye shall not seek after your heart, and after your eyes, which ye committed fornication after them.[40]So that ye shall remember, and ye did all my commands, and ye were holy to your God.[41]I am Jehovah your God who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to be to you for God; I am Jehovah your God.","Num.16":"[1]And Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, will take, and Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab; and On, son of Peleth, sons of Reuben;[2]And they will rise up before Moses, and men from the sons of Israel, fifty and two hundred chiefs of the assembly, called by appointment, and men of name:[3]And they will gather together against Moses, and against Aaron, and they will say to them, Much to you for all the assembly, all of them are holy, and Jehovah in the midst of them: and wherefore shall be lifted up over the gathering of Jehovah?[4]And Moses will hear, and will fall upon his face:[5]And he will speak to Korah and to all his assembly, saying, The morning Jehovah will make known who is to him, and the holy; and bring near to him: and whom he will choose for him he will bring near to himself.[6]This do ye: take to you censers, Korah and all his assembly:[7]And ye shall give fire in them and put upon them incense, before Jehovah to-morrow: and it was the man whom Jehovah shall choose, he is holy: much to you, ye sons of Levi.[8]And Moses will say to Korah, Hear, now, ye sons of Levi:[9]Is this small for you that the God of Israel separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to him to serve the services of the dwelling of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to serve them?[10]He will bring thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and did ye seek also the priesthood?[11]For this thou and all thine assembly being collected together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye shall murmur against him?[12]And Moses will send to call for Dathan and for Abiram, sons of Eliab and they will say, We will not come up.[13]Is this small that thou broughtest us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, that thou ruling also wilt rule over us?[14]But not to a land flowing with milk and honey didst thou bring us; and wilt thou give to us the inheritance of field and vineyard? the eyes of these men wilt thou bore out? we will not come up.[15]And it will be kindled to Moses greatly, and he will say to Jehovah, Thou wilt not turn to their gift: not one ass did I take from them, and I did not evil to one of them.[16]And Moses will say to Korah, Be thou and all thine assembly before Jehovah, thou and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:[17]And take each his censer and put incense upon them, and bring them near before Jehovah, each his censer and put incense upon them, and bring them near before Jehovah, each his censer, fifty and two hundred censers; and thou and Aaron, each his censer.[18]And they will take each his censer and will give upon them fire, and will put incense upon them, and they will stand at the door of the tent of appointment, and Moses and Aaron.[19]And Korah will gather against them all the assembly at the door of the tent of appointment; and the glory of Jehovah will be seen to all the assembly.[20]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,[21]Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them as in a moment,[22]And they shall fall upon their faces, and they will say, God, the God of the spirits for all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry against all the assembly.[23]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[24]Speak to all the assembly, saying, Go up from round about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.[25]And Moses will rise up and go to Dathan and Abiram; and the old men of Israel will go after him.[26]And he will speak to the assembly, saying, Remove, now, from the tents of these guilty men, and ye shall not touch upon any thing which is to them lest ye shall he destroyed in all their sin.[27]And they will go up from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, from round about; and Dathan and Abiram will come forth, standing at the door of their tents, and their wives and their sons and their little ones.[28]And Moses will say, By this shall ye know that Jehovah sent me to do all these works; for not from my heart.[29]If according to the death of all men these shall die, if the providence of all men shall be reviewed upon them, Jehovah sent me not.[30]And if Jehovah shall create a creation, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them and all which is to them, and they went down living to hades; and ye know that these men rejected Jehovah,[31]And it shall be as he finished to speak all these words, the earth shall cleave asunder which is under them:[32]And the earth shall open her mouth and shall swallow them and their houses, and all the men which to Korah, and all the possessions.[33]And they went down, and all which is to them, living, to hades, and the earth shall cover over them; and they shall perish from the midst of the gathering.[34]And all Israel which were round about them fled at their voice: for they said, Lest the earth shall swallow us.[35]And a fire will come forth from Jehovah and will consume the fifty and two hundred men bringing the incense.[36]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[37]Say to Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, and he shall take up the censers from the midst of the burning, and scatter the fire afar off; for they were consecrated.[38]The censers of these sinners against their souls, and they made them beaten plates, a covering for the altar: for they brought them before Jehovah, and they will be consecrated: and they will be for a sign to the sons of Israel.[39]And Eleazar the priest will take the brazen censers, which they being burnt brought near; and they shall beat them out a covering for the altar,[40]A remembrance to the sons of Israel, so that a man, a stranger, shall not come near, he who is not from the seed of Aaron, to burn incense before Jehovah; and he shall not be as Korah and as his assembly: as Jehovah spake to him by the hand of Moses.[41]And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will murmur on the morrow against Moses, and against Aaron, saying, Ye killed the people of Jehovah.[42]And it shall be in the gathering together of the assembly against Moses and against Aaron, and they shall turn towards the tent of appointment;

And they will fall upon their faces.[46]And Moses will say to Aaron, Take a censer and give upon it fire from off the altar, and put incense, and go quickly to the assembly, and expiate for them: for anger went forth from before Jehovah; for it began smiting.[47]And Aaron will take as Moses spake, and he will run into the midst of the assembly; and behold, it began smiting among the people: and he will give incense and will expiate for the people.[48]And he will stand between the dead and between the living; and the smiting will be withheld.[49]And they dying in the smiting will be fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides they dying for the words of Korah.[50]And Aaron will turn back to Moses to the door of the tent of appointment: and the smiting was withheld.","Num.17":"[1]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[2]Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from them a rod, a rod according to the house of the father, from all the chiefs according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: thou shalt write each his name upon his rod.[3]And Aaron’s name shalt thou write upon the rod of Levi: for one rod is for the head of the house of their fathers.[4]And place them in the tent of appointment before the testimony, where I will pass over to you there.[5]And it was the man whom I shall desire him, his rod shall be fruitful: and I caused to cease from me the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they are murmuring against you.[6]And Moses will speak to the sons of Israel, and all their chiefs will give to him a rod for one chief, a rod for one chief, according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: and Aaron’s rod in the midst of their rods.[7]And Moses will place the rods before Jehovah in the tent of testimony.[8]And it shall be on the morrow, and Moses will go into the tent of testimony; and behold, Aaron’s rod was fruitful for the house of Levi, and the blossom will come forth and the flower will flourish and will show almonds.[9]And Moses will bring forth all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel: and they shall see and shall take each his rod.[10]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Turn back Aaron’s rod before the testimony, for preservation, for a sign for the sons of contradiction; and thou shalt finish their murmurings from me, and they shall not die.[11]And Moses will do: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.[12]And the sons of Israel will speak to Moses, saying, Behold, we expired, we perished, we all perished.[13]All coming near, coming near the dwelling of Jehovah, and dying, shall die: shall we die to breathe out life?","Num.18":"[1]And Jehovah will say to Aaron, Thou, and thy sons, and thy father’s house with thee, shall bear the iniquity of the holy place: and thou and thy sons with thee, shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.[2]And also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, and they shall be joined to thee, and they shall serve thee: and thou and thy sons with thee, before the tent of testimony.[3]And they watched thy watches, and the watches of all the tent: but to the vessels of the holy place, and to the altar they shall not come near, and they shall not die, also they, also ye.[4]And they were joined to thee, and they watched the watches of the tent of appointment for all the service of the tent: and the stranger shall not come near to you.[5]And ye watched the watches of the holy place, and the watches of the altar; and anger shall no more be upon the sons of Israel.[6]And I, behold, I took your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel: to you being given a gift to Jehovah to serve the services of the tent of appointment.[7]And thou and thy sons with thee shall watch your priesthood for all the word of the altar, and to within the vail; and ye served: the services a gift I will give your priesthood; and the stranger coming near shall die.[8]And Jehovah will speak to Aaron, And I, behold, I gave to thee the watches of my offerings for all the holy things of the sons of Israel; to thee I gave them, for the anointing, and to thy sons for a law forever.[9]This shall be to thee from the holy of holies, from the fire: all their oblations for all their gifts, and for all their sins, and for all their sacrifices, which they shall give back to me, it is holy of holies to thee and to thy sons.[10]In the holy of holies ye shall eat it; every male shall eat it: holy shall it be to thee.[11]And this is to thee; the offerings of their gifts for all the liftings up of the sons of Israel: to thee I gave them, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, for a law forever: all clean in thy house shall eat it.[12]All the fat of the oil, and all the fat of the new wine, and of the grain, their first-fruits which they shall give to Jehovah, to thee I gave them.[13]The first-fruits, all which are in the land which they shall bring to Jehovah, shall be to thee;

And Balak, son of Zippor, the king of Moab in that time.[5]And he will send messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the sons of his people, to call to him, saying, Behold, a people came forth out of Egypt: behold, it covered the eye of the earth, and it dwelt from before me.[6]And now, come now, curse to me this people, for he is strong above me: perhaps I shall be able to strike upon him, and drive him out of the land, for I know whom thou shalt praise is praised, and whom thou shalt curse, shall be cursed.[7]And the old men of Moab and the old men of Midian, will go, and divinations in their hand; and they will come to Balsam, and they will speak to him the words of Balak.[8]And he will say to them, Remain here this night, and I will turn back word to you according as Jehovah will speak to me: and the leaders of Moab will dwell with Balaam.[9]And God will come to Balaam, and will say, What men these with thee?[10]And Balaam will say to God, Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent to me,[11]Behold, the people came forth out of Egypt, and it will cover the eye of the earth: now come curse him to me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against him and I drove him out.[12]And God will say to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for he is praised.[13]And Balaam will rise in the morning and will say to the leaders of Balak, Go to your land: for Jehovah refused to give me to go with you.[14]And the leaders will rise and go to Balak, and say, Balaam refused to come with us,[15]And Balak will add yet to send leaders, many and honorable, more than these.[16]And they will go to Balaam, and say to him, Thus said Balak, son of Zippor, Now thou wilt not withhold from coming to me:[17]For honoring, I will honor thee greatly, and all which thou shalt say to me I will do; and come, now, curse to me this people.[18]And Balaam will answer, and say to the servants of Balak, If Balak will give to me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to pass over the mouth of Jehovah my God to do little or great.[19]And now, sit ye down, now also in here this night, and I shall know what Jehovah will add to speak with me.[20]And God will come to Balaam at night, and say to him, If the men have come to call to thee, rise up, go with them, and only the word which I shall speak to thee, thou shalt do it.[21]And Balaam will rise up in the morning, and saddle his ass, and go with the leaders of Moab.[22]And the anger of God will kindle because he went; and the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the way, for an adversary to him: and he rode upon his ass, and his two young men with him.[23]And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass will turn from the way and go into the field: and Balaam will strike the ass to turn her in the way.[24]And the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the hollow of the vineyards, an enclosure hence, and an enclosure thence.[25]And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will press to the wall, and she will press Balaam’s foot to the wall; and he will add to strike her,[26]And the messenger of Jehovah will add to pass by and stand in a narrow place where is no way to turn to the right, and to the left.[27]And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will lie down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger will kindle, and he will strike the ass With a rod.[28]And Jehovah will open the mouth of the ass, and she will say to Balaam, What did I to thee that thou hast smitten me this three beats?[29]And Balaam will say to the ass, Because thou didst vex me: would that a sword was in my hand, for now I had killed thee.[30]And the ass will say to Balaam, Am not I thine ass which thou didst ride upon me ever since thou wert till this day? and being accustomed, was I accustomed to do to thee thus? And he will say, No.[31]And Jehovah will uncover the the eyes of Balsam, and he will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and he will bow down and worship upon his face.[32]And the messenger of Jehovah will say to him, For what didst thou strike thine ass this three beats? behold, I came forth for an adversary, for the way is perverse before me.[33]And the ass will see me, and will turn before me this three beats: unless she turned from before me for now also I had slain thee, and preserved her alive.[34]And Balaam will say to the messenger of Jehovah, I sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest to meet me in the way; and now if evil in thine eyes, I will turn back to me.[35]And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Balaam, Go with the men: and only the word which I shall speak to thee thou shalt speak it: and Balaam will go with the leaders of Balak.[36]And Balak will hear that Balsam came, and he will go forth to meet him to a city of Moab, which is by the boundary of Arnon, which is in the end of the boundary.[37]And Balak will say to Balaam, Sending, did I not send to thee to call to thee? wherefore camest thou not to me? indeed shall I not be able to honor thee?[38]And Balaam will say to Balak, Behold, I come to thee: being able, shall I be able to speak any thing? the word which Jehovah shall put in my mouth I will speak it.[39]And Balaam will go with Balak and they will come to Kirjath Huzoth.[40]And Balak will sacrifice oxen and sheep, and he will send to Balaam and to the leaders which were with him.[41]And it will be in the morning, and Balak will take Balaam, and will bring him up to the heights of Baal, and he will see from thence the end of the people.","Num.23":"[1]And Balaam will say to Balak, Build to me here seven altars, and prepare to me here seven bullocks and seven rams.[2]And Balak will do as Balsam spake, and Balak will bring up, and Balaam, a bullock and a ram upon the altar.[3]And Balsam will say to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to my meeting: and the word which he will shew to me I will announce to thee.

This shall be to you the land according to the boundaries round about.[13]And Moses will command the sons of Israel, saying, This the land which ye shall inherit it by lot, which Jehovah commanded to give to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.[14]For the tribe of the sons of Reuben took according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to the house of their fathers, and the half tribe of Manasseh took their inheritance.[15]The two tribes and the half tribe took their inheritance from the other side to Jordan of Jericho eastward from the rising.[16]And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,[17]These the names of the men which shall cause you to inherit the land: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.[18]And one chief, one chief shall ye take from a tribe to cause to inherit the land.[19]And these the names of the men: for the tribe of Judah: Caleb, son of Jephunneh.[20]And for the tribe of the sons of Simeon: Shemuel, son of Ammihud.[21]For the tribe of Benjamin: Elidad, the son of Chislon.[22]And for the tribe of the sons of Dan: chief Bukki, son of Jogli.[23]For the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of the sons of Manasseh: the chief Hanniel, son of Ephod.[24]And for the tribe of the sons of Ephraim: chief Kemuel, son of Shiphtan.[25]And for the tribe of the sons of Zebulon: Elizaphan, son of Parnach.[26]And for the tribe of the sons of Issachar: chief Paltiel, son of Azzan.[27]And for the tribe of the sons of Asher: chief Ahihud, son of Shelomi.[28]And for the tribe of the sons of Naphtali: chief Pedahel, son of Ammihud.[29]These whom Jehovah commanded to cause the sons of Israel to inherit in the land of Canaan.","Num.35":"[1]And Jehovah will speak to Moses in the desert of Moab by Jordan of Jericho, saying,[2]Command the sons of Israel, and they gave to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and areas to the cities round about them shall ye give to the Levites.[3]And the cities were to them to dwell in; and their areas shall be for their cattle, and for their horses, and for all their beasts.[4]And the areas of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites from the wall of the city and without, a thousand cubits round about.[5]And ye measured from without the city the east side two thousand cubits, and the south side two thousand by the cubit, and the side of the sea two thousand by the cubit, and the north side two thousand by the cubit; and the city in the midst: this shall be to them the areas of the cities.[6]And the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, six cities of refuge, which ye shall give to flee there to the slayer: and upon them ye shall give forty and two.[7]All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, forty and eight cities: them and their areas.[8]And the cities which ye shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel: from the many ye shall multiply;

cities of refuge shall they be.[15]For the sons of Israel and for the stranger, and for the sojourner in the midst of you shall be six cities: these for refuge to flee there all smiting a soul in error.[16]And if with an instrument of iron he smote him, the slayer shall die; the slayer he dying, shall die.[17]And if with a stone of the hand which he shall die by it he smote him, he the slayer shall die; dying, the slayer shall die.[18]Or with an instrument of wood of the hand, which he shall die by it he smote him, he the slayer shall die; dying, the slayer shall die.[19]The nearest relative of blood he shall kill the slayer: in his meeting him he shall kill him.[20]And if in hatred he thrust at him, or cast upon him, or in lying in wait, he shall die.[21]Or in enmity he smote with his hand, and he will die; dying, he smiting shall die; he is a slayer: the nearest relative of blood shall kill the slayer in his meeting him.[22]And if suddenly, not in enmity, he thrust him, or cast upon him any instrument in not lying in wait,[23]Or with any stone which he shall die by it in not seeing, and it will fall upon him and he shall die, and he not an enemy to him and not seeking his hurt:[24]And the assembly judged between him smiting, and between the nearest relation of blood according to these judgments:[25]And the assembly delivered the slayer out of the hand of the nearest relation of blood, and the assembly turned him back to the city of his refuge where he fled there: and he dwelt in it till the death of the great priest who anointed him with the holy oil.[26]And if going out the slayer shall go out of the boundary of the city of his refuge where he shall flee there;[27]And the nearest relation of blood finding him without the boundary of the city of his refuge, and the nearest relation of blood slew the slayer;

as the small so the great shall ye hear; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is to God; and the word which shall be hard for you, ye shall bring to me and I heard it.[18]And I will command you in that time all the words which ye shall do.[19]And we shall remove from Horeb and we shall go all that great and fearful desert which ye saw, the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we shall come to Kadesh-Barnea.[20]And I said to you, Ye came to the mountain of the Amorite which Jehovah our God gave to us.[21]See, Jehovah thy God gave the land before thee: go up, possess, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers spake to thee; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not be pressed down.[22]And ye shall come near to me all of you, and ye will say, We will send men before us, and they shall search out for us the land, and shall turn us back word the way which we shall go up into it, and the cities which we shall come into them.[23]And the word will be good in mine eyes: and I will take from you twelve men, one man to a tribe.[24]And they will turn and go up to the mountain, and they will come to the valley of Eshcol, and will search it out.[25]And they will take in their hand from the fruit of the land, and they will come down to us and will turn us back word, and will say, A good land which Jehovah our God gave to us.[26]And ye were not willing to go up, and ye will rebel against the mouth of Jehovah your God,[27]And ye will murmur in your tents, and say, In Jehovah’s hating us he brought us out of the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us.[28]Whither are we going up? our brethren melted our heart, saying, A people great and high above us; cities great and fortified to the heavens; and also, the sons of the Anakims, we saw there.[29]And I said to you, Ye shall not be terrified, and ye shall not be afraid of them.[30]Jehovah your God went before you; he will fight for you according to all that he did to you in Egypt before your eyes.[31]And in the desert where thou sawest that Jehovah thy God lifted thee up, as a man will lift up his son, in all the way that ye went till your coming to this place.[32]And in this word ye are not believing in Jehovah your God.[33]He going in the way before you to search out for you a place for you to encamp, in fire by night, to cause you to see in what way ye shall go in it, and in a cloud by day.[34]And Jehovah will hear the voice of your words, and he will be angry, and he will swear, saying,[35]If a man among these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I sware to give to your fathers,[36]Except Caleb, son of Jephunneh;

for thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.[28]And command Joshua and strengthen him, and make him firm, for he shall pass through before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.[29]And we shall dwell in the valley over against the House of Opening.","Deut.4":"[1]And now Israel, hear to the laws and to the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that ye shall live and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers gave to you.[2]Ye shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, and ye shall not take away from it, to watch the commands of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.[3]Your eyes saw what Jehovah did upon Baal-Peor: for every man who went after Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God destroyed him from the midst of you.[4]And ye cleaving to Jehovah your God, are living all of you this day.[5]See, I taught you laws and judgments as Jehovah my God commanded me, to do thus in the midst of the land where ye are going there to possess it.[6]And watch and do: for it is your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples who shall hear all these laws, and say, Only this great nation a wise and understanding people.[7]For what great nation to whom God being near to it as Jehovah our God in all our calling to him?[8]And what great nation to whom laws and judgments just, as all the instructions which I give before you this day?[9]Only watch to thyself and watch thy soul greatly, lest thou shalt forget the words which thine eyes saw, and lest they shall remove from thy heart all the days of thy life: and make them known to thy sons and to the sons of thy sons.[10]The day thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, in Jehovah saying to me, Gather to me the people and I will cause them to hear my word, that they shall be taught to fear me all the days which they live upon the land;

he will not desert thee, and he will not destroy thee, and he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware to them.[32]For ask now to the former days which were before thee from the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the end of the heavens to the end of the heavens, Has there been as this great word, or was heard like it?[33]Did people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire as thou didst hear, and shall live?[34]Or did God try to go and take to him a nation from the midst of a nation by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a strong hand and by an extended arm, and by great fears, according to all that Jehovah your God did to you in Egypt before your eyes?[35]Thou sawest to know that Jehovah he is God: no more beside him.[36]Out of the heavens he caused thee to hear his voice to instruct thee: and upon earth he caused thee to see his great fire, and thou heardest his words from the midst of the fire.[37]And because that he loved thy fathers he will choose in his seed after him, and he will bring thee out before him with his great strength from Egypt.[38]To drive out nations great and strong above thee, from thy face, to bring thee in to give to thee their land an inheritance as this day.[39]And know thou this day, and turn back to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in the heavens from above and upon the earth underneath: and none yet.[40]And watch thou his laws and his commands which I am commanding thee this day, that it shall be good to thee and to thy sons after thee, and that thou shalt prolong the days upon the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee, all the days.[41]Then Moses will separate three cities in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;[42]For the slayer to flee there when he shall slay his friend without knowledge; and he hated him not yesterday the third day; and he fled to one of these cities and he lived:[43]Bezer in the desert, in the land of the plain to the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan, to the Manassites.[44]And this the instruction which Moses set before the sons of Israel.[45]These the testimonies and the laws and the judgments which Moses spake to the sons of Israel in their going forth out of Egypt,[46]In the other side of Jordan, in the valley over against the House of Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon, whom Moses smote, and the sons of Israel, in their going out of Egypt.[47]And they shall possess their land and the land of Og, king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, which in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;[48]From Aroer, which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and even to mount Sion (it is Hermon.)[49]And all the desert the other side of Jordan, from the sun-rising and even to the sea, the desert under the springs of Pisgah.","Deut.5":"[1]And Moses will call to all Israel, and say, Hear, thou Israel, the laws and the judgments which I speak in your ears this day, and learn them, and watch to do them.[2]Jehovah our God cut out with us a covenant in Horeb.[3]Jehovah cut not out this covenant with our fathers, but with us, we, these here this day, all we living.[4]Face to face Jehovah spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire.[5](I stood between Jehovah and between you in that time to announce to you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid on account of the fire and ye went not up into the mount,) saying,[6]I Jehovah thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of servants.[7]There shall not be to thee other gods before me.[8]Thou shalt not make to thee a carved thing, any appearance that is in the heavens from above, and which is in the earth underneath, and that is in the waters under the earth:[9]Thou shalt not worship to them, and thou shalt not serve them; for I Jehovah thy God, a jealous God, striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and the fourth for hating me,[10]And doing mercy to thousands for loving me and for watching my commands.[11]Thou shalt not lift up the name of Jehovah thy God for evil, for Jehovah will not acquit whoever shall lift up his name for evil.[12]Watch the day of the Sabbath to consecrate it, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.[13]Six days thou shalt work and do all thy work,[14]And the seventh day, the Sabbath to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and thine ox, and thine ass, and all thy cattle, and thy stranger who is in thy gates; so that thy servant and thy maid shall rest like thyself.[15]And remember that thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out from there by a strong hand and by an extended arm: for this, Jehovah thy God commanded thee to do the day of the Sabbath.[16]Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee, so that thy days shall be prolonged and so that it shall be good to thee upon the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee,[17]Thou shalt not kill,[18]“Neither shall you commit adultery.[19]“Neither shall you steal.[20]“Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.[21]and thou shalt not desire thy friend’s wife;

and so that thy days shall be prolonged.[3]And hear, O Israel, and watch to do, that it shall be well to thee, and that ye shall multiply greatly as Jehovah the God of your fathers spake to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey.[4]Hear, Israel;

thou shalt remember what Jehovah thy God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.[19]The great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs and the wonders; and the strong hand and the extended arm by which Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do to all people of whose face thou art afraid.[20]And also the hornet, Jehovah thy God will send among you till the destroying of those being left and of those hiding from thy face.[21]Thou shalt not be terrified from their faces, for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great and fearful God.[22]And Jehovah thy God cast out these nations from thy face, little, little;

so that he caused thee to know that upon bread only man shall not live, but upon all going out of the mouth of Jehovah shall man live.[4]Thy garments decayed not from thee, and thy feet swelled not this forty years.[5]And know thou with thy heart that as a man will chastise his son, Jehovah thy God chastises thee.[6]And watch thou the commands of Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways and to fear him.[7]For Jehovah thy God brings thee to a good land, a land of torrents of water, fountains, and depths going forth in the valley and in the mountain;[8]A land of wheat and barley and the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate, a land of the olive tree, of oil and honey;[9]A land where thou shalt eat bread in it not with poverty; thou shalt not want any thing in it; a land whose stones, iron, and out of its mountains thou shalt hew out brass.[10]And thou atest and wert satisfied, and didst bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he gave to thee.[11]Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, not watching his commands and his judgments and his laws which I command thee this day:[12]Lest thou shalt eat and thou wert satisfied, and thou wilt build good houses and thou dwelt;[13]And thy cattle and thy sheep shall multiply, and thy silver and thy gold shall multiply to thee, and all which is in thee shall multiply;[14]And thy heart was lifted up and thou didst forget Jehovah thy God bringing thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants;[15]He causing thee to go in the great and fearful desert, the fiery serpent and the scorpion, and a thirsty land, where is no water: he bringing forth to thee water from the rock of flint;[16]He giving thee to eat manna in the desert which thy fathers knew not, in order to humble thee, and in order to try thee to do thee good in thy lost state:[17]And thou saidst in thy heart, My strength and the bone of my handmade for me this wealth.[18]And remember Jehovah thy God; for he gave to thee strength to make wealth in order to set up his covenant, which he sware to our fathers, as this day.[19]And it was, if forgetting, thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and thou wentest after other gods, and served them and worshipped to them, I testified against you this day, that perishing, ye shall perish.[20]As the nations which Jehovah destroys before you, so shall ye be destroyed, because ye will not hear to the voice of Jehovah your God.","Deut.9":"[1]Hear, Israel: Thou passest this day over Jordan to go to possess nations great and strong above thee;

and thou shalt not drink the wine, and thou shalt not gather, for the worm shall eat it.[40]Olive trees shall be to thee in all thy boundaries, and thou shalt not be anointed with oil, for thine olive shall slip away.[41]And thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be to thee, for they shall go into captivity.[42]All thy wood and the fruit of thy land shall the grasshopper seize.[43]The stranger which is in the midst of thee shall go up above thee, going up, going up; and thou shalt go down beneath, beneath.[44]He shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be for head, and thou shalt be for tail.[45]And all these curses came upon thee and pursued thee and overtook thee, till he destroyed thee; for thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to watch his commands and his laws which he commanded thee.[46]And they were upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed even to forever.[47]Because that thou servedst not Jehovah thy God in joy and in a good heart for the multitude of all things.[48]And thou servedst thine enemies which Jehovah shall send forth against thee in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things and he gave a yoke of iron upon thy neck till his destroying thee.[49]Jehovah shall raise up against thee a nation from far off, from the extremity of the earth, as the eagle shall fly, whose tongue thou shalt not hear;[50]A nation strong of face who shall not lift up the face to the old man, and shall not compassionate the young.[51]And it shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land till he destroyed thee: which shall not leave to thee grain, new wine or new oil, the offspring of thine oxen and the flocks of thy sheep, till his destroying thee.[52]And he passed upon thee in all thy gates until the coming down of thy high and inaccessible fortresses which thou trustest in them in all thy land: and he passed upon thee in all thy gates in all thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.[53]And thou atest the fruit of thy belly, the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters, which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, in the distress and in the straitness which thine enemy shall press upon thee:[54]The man tender in thee, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil upon his brother, and upon the wife of his bosom, and upon the remainder of his sons which he shall leave:[55]The gift to one of them of the flesh of his sons which he shall eat from: nothing remaining to him of all things in the distress and in the straitness which his enemy shall press upon thee in all thy gates.[56]She tender and delicate in thee, who tried not to set the sole of her foot upon the earth from delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil upon the husband of her bosom, and upon her son, and upon her daughter,[57]And upon her afterbirth coming forth from between her feet, and upon her sons which she shall bear: for she will eat them in want of all things, in secret, in the distress and in the straitness which thine enemy shall press upon thee in thy gates.[58]If thou shalt not watch to do all the words of this law being written in this book, to fear this honored and fearful name JEHOVAH THY GOD;[59]And Jehovah made thy smiting wonderful, and the smitings of thy seed, great and lasting blows, and evil and lasting diseases.[60]And he turned back upon thee all the sicknesses of Egypt, of which thou west afraid from their face, and they did cleave to thee.[61]Also every disease and every blow which is not written in the book of this law, Jehovah will bring them up upon thee, till he destroyed thee.[62]And ye were left few in extension, instead of which ye were as the stars of the heavens for multitude, because thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah thy God.[63]And it being as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you, so Jehovah shall rejoice over you to destroy you and to cut you off; and ye were torn away from the land which thou wentest in there to possess it.[64]And Jehovah scattered thee among all peoples from the end of the earth even to the end of the earth; and thou servedst there other gods which thou knewest not, thou and thy fathers, wood and stone.[65]And among these nations thou shalt not rest, and there shall not be rest to the sole of thy foot: and Jehovah gave to thee there a trembling heart and a wasting away of the eyes, and a faintness of soul.[66]And thy lives were hung before thee; and thou wert afraid night and day, and thou shalt not trust to thy life.[67]In the morning thou shalt say, Who shall give evening? and in the evening thou shalt say, Who shall give morning? from the feat of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and from the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.[68]And Jehovah turned thee back to Egypt in ships, in the way; which I said to thee, Thou shalt not add more to see it: and ye were sold there to thine enemies for servants, and for maids, and none buying.","Deut.29":"[1]These the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.[2]And Moses will call to all Israel and will say, to them, Ye saw all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;[3]The great temptations which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:[4]And Jehovah gave not to you an heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, even to this day.[5]And I shall lead you forty years in the desert: your garments did not fall away from you, and thy shoe was not warn away from thy foot.[6]Bread ye ate not, and wine and strong drink ye drank not; so that ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.[7]And ye shall come to this place; and Sihon, king of Heshbon, will come, and Og, king of Bashan, to our meeting, to war; and we shall smite them.[8]And we shall take their land and give it for an inheritance to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of the Manassites.[9]And watch ye the words of this covenant, and do them, so that ye shall be circumspect in all things which ye shall do.[10]Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads of your tribes, your old men, and your scribes, every man of Israel;[11]Your little ones, your wives and thy stranger which is in the midst of thy camp, from him cutting thy woods to him drawing thy waters:[12]For thy passing into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God made with thee this day:[13]In order to set thee this day to him for a people, and he shall be to thee for God as he spake to thee, and as he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob.[14]And not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath;[15]But with those being here with us, standing before Jehovah our God, and with those not here with us this day:[16](For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we passed through in the midst of the nations which ye passed through;[17]And ye shall see their abominations and their rollings, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them:)[18]Lest there be among you man or woman, or family or tribe, whom his heart turn this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be among you a root bearing poverty and wormwood;[19]And it was in his hearing the words of this oath, and he blessed himself in his heart, saying, Peace shall be to me, if in the hardness of my heart, I shall go to add satiating to thirst:[20]Jehovah shall not be willing to forgive him, for then the anger of Jehovah shall smoke, and his jealousy against that man, and every curse written in this book lay upon him, and Jehovah wiped out his name from under the heavens.[21]And Jehovah separated him for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in the book of this law:[22]And said, Another generation of your sons who shall rise up from after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a land afar off, and they saw the blows of that land, and the sicknesses which Jehovah made sick in it;[23]Pitch and burning salt, all its land; it shall not be sown, and it shall not sprout, and no green herb shall come up upon it, as the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath:[24]And all the nations said, For what did Jehovah thus to this land? what the heat of this great anger?[25]And they said, Because they left the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which he made with them; in his bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.[26]And they will go and serve other gods, and will worship to them gods which they knew them not, and a portion not to them.[27]And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against this land, to bring upon it all the curses written in this book.[28]And Jehovah will tear them up from their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great anger, and will send them to another land as this day.[29]Hidden things to Jehovah our God: and uncovered things to us and to our sons to forever, to do all the words of this law.","Deut.30":"[1]And it being when all these words shall come upon thee, the blessing, and the curse which I gave before thee, and thou shalt turn back to thy heart in all these nations where Jehovah thy God thrust thee away there,[2]And thou turnedst back to Jehovah thy God, and heardst to his voice according to all which I command thee this day, thou and thy sons, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:[3]And Jehovah thy God turned back thy captivity, and pitied thee, and he turned back and gathered thee from all the peoples, where Jehovah thy God scattered thee there.[4]If thy expelling shall be to the end of the heavens, from there thy God will gather thee, and from there he will take thee:[5]And Jehovah thy God brought thee to the land which thy fathers inherited, and thou inheritedst it: and he did good to thee and multiplied thee above thy fathers.[6]And Jehovah thy God circumcised thy heart and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, for the sake of thy life.[7]And Jehovah thy God gave all these curses upon thine enemies and upon those hating thee, who chased thee.[8]And thou shalt turn back and hear to the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commands which I command thee this day.[9]And Jehovah thy God caused thee to abound in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land for good: for Jehovah will turn back to be glad over thee for good as he was glad over thy fathers:[10]If thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God to watch his commands and his laws written in the book of this law, if thou shalt turn back to Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.[11]For this command which I command thee this day, it was not great for thee, and it was not far off.[12]It is not in the heavens to say, Who shall go up for us to the heavens to take it to us and cause us to hear it and do it?[13]And it is not beyond the sea, to say, Who shall pass over for us to the other side of the sea, and take it to us and cause us to hear it and do it?[14]For the word is very near to thee in thy mouth and in thy heart to do it.[15]See, I gave before thy face this day the life and the good, and the death and the evil;[16]That I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways, to watch his commands and his laws and his judgments, and live thou and multiply: and Jehovah thy God blessed thee in the land which thou wentest there to possess it.[17]And if thy heart shall turn aside and thou shalt not hear, and be thrust away and worship to other gods, and serve them;[18]I announced to you this day that perishing, ye shall perish; ye shall not prolong the days upon the land which thou passest over Jordan to go in there to possess it.[19]I called to witness against you this day the heavens and the earth, the life and the death I gave before thee, the blessing and the curse: and choose upon life, so that thou shalt live, thou and thy seed:[20]To love Jehovah thy God; to hear to his voice and to cleave to him (for this thy life and the length of thy days) to dwell upon the land which Jehovah aware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob, to give to them.","Deut.31":"[1]And Moses will go and speak these words to all Israel.[2]And he will say to them, The son of a hundred and twenty years I this day; I shall no more be able to go out and to come in: and Jehovah said to me, Thou shalt not pass through this Jordan.[3]Jehovah thy God he goes over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and possess thou them: Joshua he passes over before thee as Jehovah spake.[4]And Jehovah did to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land which be destroyed them.[5]And Jehovah gave them before you, and ye did to them according to all the commands which I commanded you.[6]Be strong and be active; ye shall not fear, and ye shall not be terrified from their face, for Jehovah thy God, he goes with thee; he will not relax thee and he will not forsake thee.[7]And Moses will call to Joshua and say to him before the eyes of all Israel, Be strong and be active, for thou shalt go in with this people to the land which Jehovah sware to thy fathers to give to them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.[8]And Jehovah he goes before thee; he shall be with thee; he will not relax thee, and he will not forsake thee; thou shalt not fear, and thou shalt not be dismayed.[9]And Moses will write this law and will give it to the priests, the sons of Levi, lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the old men of Israel.[10]And Moses commanded them, saying, From the end of seven years, in the appointment of the year of remission in the festival of tents,[11]In the coming of all Israel to see the face of Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their ears.[12]Gather the people, the men and the women and the little ones and thy stranger which is in thy gates, so that they shall hear, and so that they shall learn and fear Jehovah your God, and watch to do all the words of this law:[13]And their sons which knew not shall hear and shall learn to fear Jehovah your God all the days which they lived upon the land which ye pass over Jordan there to possess it.[14]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold thy days draw near to die: call Joshua, and stand ye in the tent of appointment, and I will command him. And Moses will go, and Joshua, and they will stand in the tent of appointment.[15]And Jehovah will be seen in the tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of the cloud will stand at the door of the tent.[16]And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold thee lying down with thy fathers, and this people rising up and committing fornication after the gods of the foreigner of the land where he going there in the midst of him, and he forsook me and brake my covenant which I made with him.[17]And my anger was kindled against him in that day, and I forsook them, and I hid my face from them, and he was for consuming, and many evils finding him, and afflictions, and he said in that day, Is it not because God is not in the midst of me these evils find us?[18]Hiding, I will hide my face in that day for all the evils which he did, for he turned to other gods.[19]And now write ye for you this song, and teach it to the sons of Israel: put it in their mouth so that this song shall be to me for a testimony among the sons of Israel.[20]For I shall bring him to the land which I sware to his fathers, flowing milk and honey; and he ate and was satisfied and was fat, and turned to other gods, and they served them and despised me and brake my covenant.[21]And it was when many evils and afflictions shall find him, and this song testified before him for a witness: for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouth of his seed; for I knew his formation which he did this day, before I shall bring him to the land which I sware.[22]And Moses will write this song in that day, and will teach it to the sons of Israel.[23]And he will command Joshua the son of Nun, and will say, Be strong and active: for thou shalt bring in the sons of Israel to the land which I sware to them, and I will be with thee.[24]And it shall be when Moses finished to write the words of this law upon a book until he finished them;[25]And Moses will command the Levites lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,[26]Take the book of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and it was there for a witness against thee.[27]For I knew thy rebellion and thy hard neck: behold, in my yet living with you this day, ye were rebelling against Jehovah; and much more after my death.[28]Gather to me all the old men of your tribes and your scribes, and I will speak in their ears these words, and I will take the heavens and the earth to witness against them.[29]For I knew after my death that acting wickedly, ye will be corrupted, and turn aside from the way that I commanded you; and evil met you in the last of the days, for ye will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to Make him angry in the work of your hands.[30]And Moses will speak in the ears of all the gathering of Israel the words of this song till he finished them.","Deut.32":"[1]Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; Thou earth shalt hear the words of my mouth.[2]My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My word shall pour out as the dew, As the showers upon the herbage, And as the rains upon the green herb:[3]For I will call the name of Jehovah: Give ye greatness to our God.[4]The Rock, his work complete: For all his ways judgment: A God of faithfulness and not of iniquity Just and right is he.[5]He acted wickedly to him; not his sons their blot: A generation perverted and crooked.[6]To Jehovah will ye recompense this, A people foolish and not wise?

And it shall burn to the lowest hades, And it shall consume the land and its produce, And it shall burn the foundations of the mountains.[23]I will gather evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.[24]Exhausted with hunger, consumed with burning, And bitter destruction: And I will send upon them the tooth of beasts, With the wrath of those crawlers of the dust.[25]The sword shall bereave without, And terror from the chambers, Also the youth, also the virgin, The suckling, with the man of gray hair.[26]I have said I will blow them away, I will turn away their remembrance from man;[27]Unless I shall fear the enemy’s their adversaries shall dissemble, Lest they shall say, Our high hand And not Jehovah did all this.[28]For they a nation destroying counsels, And no understanding in them.[29]Would they were wise! will they look at this? Will they discern to their latter part?[30]How shall one chase a thousand; And two shall cause ten thousand to flee, If that their Rock had not sold them, And Jehovah delivered them up?[31]For their rock not as our Rock, And our enemies judging.[32]For their vine from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes the grapes of poverty, The clusters of bitterness to them.[33]Their wine the wrath of dragons, And the fierce head of asps.[34]Is not this laid up with me, Sealed up in my treasuries?[35]To me vengeance and requital; At the time their foot shall waver: For the day of their destruction is near, And he hastened things prepared for them.[36]For Jehovah will judge his people, And upon his servants will he have compassion; When he shall see that the hand has failed, And nothing detained and left.[37]And he said, Where their gods, The rock they trusted in it?[38]Whose fat of their sacrifices they shall eat; They shall drink the wine of their libations They shall rise up, and they shall succor you, It shall be for you protection.[39]See ye now, that I, I am he, And no God with me: I will kill, and I will preserve alive; I struck through and through, and I will heal; And none takes away out of my hand.[40]For I will lift up my hand to the heavens, And I said, I live forever.[41]If I sharpened the lightning of my sword, And my hand shall lay hold upon judgment, I will turn back vengeance to mine adversaries, And to those hating me I will requite,[42]I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall eat flesh, From the blood of the wounded and the captivity, From the head of the enemy’s leaders.[43]Rejoice ye nations with him, For he will raise up the blood of his servants, And he will turn back vengeance to his adversaries, And he will expiate for his land, his people.[44]And Moses will come and speak all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua, son of Nun.[45]And Moses will finish speaking all these words to all Israel:[46]And he will say to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I call upon you to witness this day, which ye shall command your sons to watch and to do, all the words of this law.[47]For it is not an empty word for you, but it is your life; and in this word ye shall prolong the days upon the land which ye pass through Jordan there to inherit it.[48]And Jehovah will speak to Moses in this self-same day, saying,[49]Come up to this mountain Abarim, the mountain Nebo, which is in the lend of Moab against the face of Jericho; and see the land of Canaan which I gave to the sons of Israel for a possession.[50]And die in the mountain which thou earnest there, and be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount for and was gathered to his people:[51]Because ye acted treacherously against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of contradiction, of Kadesh in the desert Zin; because ye consecrated me not in the midst of the sons of Israel.[52]But thou shalt see the land from before, and thou shalt not come in there to the land which I gave to the sons of Israel.","Deut.33":"[1]And this the blessing which Moses the man of God praised the sons of Israel before his death.[2]And he will say, Jehovah came from mount Sinai, and he rose up from Seir to them;

and he will take of thy words.[4]Moses commanded a law for us, the inheritance of the gathering of Jacob.[5]And he will be king in Jeshurun, in the gathering the heads of the people, he united together the tribes of Israel.[6]Reuben shall live and shall not die; and his men shall be of number.[7]And this to Judah: and he will say, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and thou wilt bring him to his people; his hands a multitude for him, and thou wilt be a help from his adversaries.[8]And to Levi he said, Thy Truth and thy Light to the godly man whom they tried in the trial; thou wilt contend with him at the water of contention.[9]He saying to his father and to his mother, I saw him not, and his brethren he knew not, and he knew not his sons; for they watched thy sayings and they will keep thy covenant.[10]And they shall teach thy judgments to Jacob, and thy law to Israel; they will put incense at thy nose, and whole burnt-offerings upon thine altar.[11]Bless, Jehovah, his strength, and thou wilt accept the work of his hands: smite through and through the loins of those rising up against him, and those hating him, lest they shall rise up.[12]To Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell confidently by him; he covered over him all the day, and he dwelt between his shoulders.[13]And to Joseph he said, His land from the blessing of Jehovah, from the most excellent of the heavens, from the dew and from the deep reclining beneath,[14]And from the most excellent of the produce of the sun, and from the most excellent thrust forth of the moons,[15]And from the head of the mountains of the beginning, and from the most excellent of the perpetual hills,[16]And from the most excellent of the earth and its fulness, and the acceptance of him dwelling in the bramble: it shall come to the head of Joseph, and to the crown of the consecrated of his brethren.[17]The honor to him the first-born of the bullock, his horns the horns of the unicorn: with them he will thrust the peoples together to the extremity of the earth: these the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these the thousands of Manasseh[18]And to Zebulon he said, Rejoice, Zebulon, in thy going forth, and Issachar, in thy tents.[19]They shall call the peoples to the mountain; there they shall sacrifice sacrifices of justice, for they shall suck the abundance of the sea, and the bidden things hid in the sand.[20]And to Gad he said, Blessed he enlarging Gad: he dwelt as a lion, and he tore up the arm, also the crown.[21]And he will see the first-fruits to himself, for there the portion of the ruler he covered: and he will mark out the heads of the people; he did the justice of Jehovah, and his judgments with Israel.[22]And to Dan he said, Dan a lion’s whelp: he shall spring forth from Bashan.[23]And to Naphtali he said, Naphtali satisfied with acceptance, and filled with the blessing of Jehovah, he shall possess the sea and the south.[24]And to Asher he said, Asher blessed from sons; he shall be accepted of his brethren, and he dipped his foot in oil.[25]Thy bolt, iron and brass; and as thy days, thy rest.[26]None as the God of Jeshurun, riding the heavens in thy help and in his lifting up the choirs.[27]The God of the beginning testifying, and underneath, the perpetual arms: and he will thrust out the enemy from before thee, and will say, Destroy.[28]And Israel shall dwell confidently alone; the eye of Jacob upon a land of grain and new wine, also his heavens shall drop dew.[29]Happy, thou, Israel: who like thee, a people saved by Jehovah, the shield of thy help, and who the sword of thy lifting up and thine enemies will lie to thee, and thou wilt tread upon their heights.","Deut.34":"[1]And Moses will go up from the desert of Moab to mount Nebo, the head of Pisgah, which is upon the face of Jericho: and Jehovah will cause him to see all the land of Gilead, even to Dan.[2]And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, even to the last sea.[3]And the south and the circuit in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, even to Zoar.[4]And Jehovah will say to him, This the land which I sware to Abraham to Isaak and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed will I give it: I caused thee to see with thine eyes, and thou shalt not pass over there.[5]And Moses the servant of Jehovah will die there in the land of Moab, at the mouth of Jehovah.[6]And he will bury him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against the House of the Cleft: and no man knew his grave till this day.[7]And Moses the son of a hundred and twenty years in his dying: his eye was not weak, and the freshness fled not.[8]And the sons of Israel will weep for Moses in the desert of Moab thirty days: and the days of the weeping of the mourning for Moses will be finished.[9]And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom;

Be strong and be active; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not bend: for Jehovah thy God is with thee in all where thou shalt go.[10]And Joshua will command the scribes of the people, saying,[11]Pass through in the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare to yourselves food, for yet three days ye pass through this Jordan to go to possess the land which Jehovah your God gave to you to inherit it.[12]And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, saying,[13]Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God causes you to rest, and he gave to you this land.[14]Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall dwell in the land which Moses gave to you on the other side Jordan; and ye shall pass over, being brave, before your brethren, all being strong, of the host, and help them;[15]Till Jehovah shall cause rest to your brethren as you and they also shall inherit the land which Jehovah your God gave to them: and ye turned back to the land of your possession, and ye shall inherit it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave to you on the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun.[16]And they will answer Joshua, saying, All which thou didst command us, we will do, and where thou shalt send us, we will go.[17]According to all that we heard to Moses, so will we bear to thee: only Jehovah thy God shall be with thee as he was with Moses.[18]Every man who shall resist thy mouth, and shall not hear thy words according to all which thou shalt command him, he shall die: only be strong and be active.","Josh.2":"[1]And Joshua son of Nun will send out of Shittim two men spying silently, saying, Go see the land and Jericho. And they will go, and will come to the house of a woman, a harlot, and her name Rahab; and they will lie there.[2]And it will be said to the king of Jericho, Behold, men came here this night from the sons of Israel to search out the land.[3]And the king of Jericho will send to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men having come to thee, which came to thy house: for to search out the land they came.[4]And the woman will take the two men and hide them, and will say thus, Two men came to me, and I knew not from whence they were.[5]And it will be for the shutting the gate in darkness, and the men went forth, and I knew not whither the men went; pursue quickly after them, for ye shall overtake them.[6]And she brought them up to the roof, and she will hide them in woody flax arranged by her upon the roof.[7]And the men pursued after them the way of Jordan at the passages: and they shut the gate afterwards as they pursuing after them went forth.[8]And before they will lie down; and she went up to them upon the roof;[9]And she will say to the men, I knew that Jehovah gave to you the land, and that your terror fell upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melted from your face.[10]For we heard that Jehovah dried up the water of the sea of sedge from before you, in your coming out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites that were upon the other side of Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye destroyed them.[11]And hearing, our heart will melt and there rose up no more spirit in a man on account of your face: For Jehovah your God, he the God in the heavens from above and upon the earth beneath.[12]And now, swear now to me by Jehovah, as I did with you mercy, and do ye also mercy with the house of my father, and give to me a true sign.[13]And preserve alive my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all which is to them, and take away our souls from death.[14]And the men will say to her, Our soul instead of yours to die if ye shall not announce this our word. And it being in Jehovah’s giving to us the land, and we did with thee mercy and truth.[15]And she will let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the wall side and she will dwell upon the wall.[16]And she will say to them, Go to the mountain, lest they pursuing shall meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days till they pursuing turn back: and afterward ye shall go to your way.[17]And the men will say to her, We are free from this thine oath which thou caused us to swear.[18]Behold, we come into the land, thou shalt bind the line of this scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by it: and thy father and thy mother and thy brethren, and all thy father’s house thou shalt gather to thee to the house.[19]And it was all which went forth out of the doors of thy house without, his blood upon his head and we are free, and all which shall be with thee in the house, his blood upon our head if a hand shall be upon him.[20]And if thou shalt announce this our word, and we were free from thine oath which thou didst cause us to swear.[21]And she will say, According to your words so be it.

and all the people born in the desert in the way, in their coming out of Egypt, were not circumcised.[6]For forty years the sons of Israel went in the desert till all the people of the men of war coming out of Egypt were finished, who heard not to the voice of Jehovah: which Jehovah sware to them, not for them to see the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing milk and honey.[7]And their sons he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, for they circumcised them not in the way.[8]And it shall be as all the people finished to be circumcised, and they dwelt in their place in the camp till they revived.[9]And Jehovah will say to Joshua, This day I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.

And Joshua will fall on his face to the earth and will worship him, and will say to him, What speaks my lord to his servant?[15]And the captain of Jehovah’s host will say to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from thy foot, for the place which thou standest upon it, it is holy: and Joshua will do so.","Josh.6":"[1]And Jericho was shut up; and being shut up from before the sons of Israel, none will come out and none came in.[2]And Jehovah will say to Joshua, See, I gave into thy hand Jericho and her king, and the mighty ones of strength.[3]And encompass the city all ye men of war, and surround the city one time: so shalt thou do six days.[4]And seven priests shall lift up seven trumpets of alarms before the ark: and in the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall clang the trumpets.[5]And it was in prolonging upon the horn of the jubilee in your hearing, the voice of the trumpet, and all the people shall shout a great shout: and the walls of the city shall fall under it, and the people went up each before him.[6]And Joshua son of Nun will call to the priests and say to them, Lift up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests shall lift up seven trumpets of signals before the ark of Jehovah.[7]And they will say to the people, Pass through and surround the city, and he being armed shall pass by before the ark of Jehovah.[8]And it will be as Joshua said to the people, and the seven priests lifting up the seven trumpets of alarms before Jehovah, passed by and clanged upon the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them.[9]And he being armed, went before the priests that clanged with the trumpets, and the gathering went after the ark, going and clanging with the trumpets.[10]And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, and ye shall not cause your voice to be heard, and a word shall not go forth out of your mouth till the day I said to you, Shout, and shout ye.[11]And the ark of Jehovah will encompass the city, surrounding one time: and they will come into the camp and will pass the night in the camp.[12]And Joshua will rise early in the morning, and the priests will lift up the ark of Jehovah.[13]And seven priests lifting up seven trumpets of alarms before the ark of Jehovah went on going, and they clanged with the trumpets, and he being armed went before them; and the gathering went after the ark of Jehovah, going and clanging with the trumpets.[14]And they will surround the city in the second day one time, and they will turn back to the camp. So they did six days.[15]And it will be in the seventh day, and they will rise early in the ascending of the dawn, and they will encompass the city according to this judgment seven times; only in that day they encompassed the city seven times.[16]And it will be in the seventh time the priests clanged with the trumpets and Joshua will say to the people, Shout; for Jehovah gave to you the city.[17]And the city was devoted, it, and all which is in it, to Jehovah: only Rehab the harlot shall live; she and all which with her in the house, because she hid the messengers which we sent.[18]And ye, watch ye from the devoted thing lest ye shall be devoted, and ye take from the devoted thing and ye set the camp of Israel to be devoted, and ye troubled it.[19]And all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron, it holy to Jehovah: it shall be brought to the treasury of Jehovah.[20]And the people will shout and clang with the trumpets: and it will be as the people heard the voice of the trumpet, and the people will shout a great shout, and the wall will fall under it, and the people will go up to the city, each before him, and they will take the city.[21]And they will devote all which in the city, from man and even to woman, and from the youth even to the old man, and ox and sheep and ass, to the mouth of the sword.[22]And to the two men spying the land Joshua said, Go in to the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring forth from thence the woman and all which is to her, as ye sware to her.[23]And the young men spying will go in and bring forth Rehab, and her father and her mother and her brethren, and all which is to her; and all her families they will bring forth, and they will leave them without the camp of Israel.[24]And they burnt the city in fire and all which is in it: only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and iron they gave to the treasury of the house of Jehovah.[25]And Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father and all which is to her, Joshua preserved alive; and she will dwell in the midst of Israel till this day, because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent out to spy Jericho.[26]And Joshua will swear in that time, saying, Cursed the man before Jehovah who shall rise up and build this city Jericho: in his first-born he shall lay its foundation and in his younger he shall set up its doors.[27]And Jehovah will be with Joshua; and his fame will be in all the land.","Josh.7":"[1]And the sons of Israel will transgress a transgression in the devoted thing: and Achan, son of Carmi son of Zabdi, son of Zerah to the tribe; of Judah, will take from the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah will kindle against the sons of Israel.[2]And Joshua will send men from Jericho to Ai, which is by the house of Ain, from the east, to the house of God, and he will say to them, saying, Go up and spy the land.

And Joshua will stretch forth with the javelin which in his hand, to the city.[19]And the ambush rose quickly from its place, and they will run when he stretched out his hand: and they will come into the city and take it, and they will hasten and set the city on fire.[20]And the men of Ai will turn back behind them and will see, and behold, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens, and there was not with them hands to flee hither and thither: and the people having fled, turned back to the pursuers.[21]And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush took the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, and they will turn back and smite the men of Ai.[22]And these will go forth from the city to their meeting; and they will be to Israel in the midst of these from hence, and these from thence: and they will smite them till none were left to them fleeing and escaping.[23]And the king of Ai they seized, living, and they will bring him to Joshua.[24]And it will be when Israel finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the desert, where they pursued them in it, and all of them will fall before the mouth of the sword till they were finished, and all Israel will turn back to Ai and will smite it by the mouth of the sword.[25]And it will be, all falling in that day from men, even to women, twelve thousand; all the men of Ai.[26]And Joshua turned not back his hand which he stretched out with the spear till he exterminated all the inhabitants of Ai.[27]Only the cattle and spoil of that city Israel plundered to  themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.[28]And Joshua will burn Ai and set it a heap forever, a waste even to this day.[29]And the king of Ai he hung upon the tree till the time of evening: and when the sun went down Joshua commanded and they will take down his carcass from the tree and cast it at the opening of the gate of the city, and they will set upon it a great heap of stones till this day.[30]Then Joshua will build an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel in mount Ebal.[31]As Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the sons of Israel, as it was written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of stones complete; which iron was not lifted up upon them: and they will bring up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah, and will sacrifice peace.[32]And he will write there upon the stones the second of the law of Moses which he wrote before the sons of Israel.[33]All Israel and his old men and scribes, and his judges stood hence, and thence, to the ark before the priests the Levites, lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, so the stranger as the native; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded to bless the people of Israel in the beginning.[34]And after this he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all the writing in the book of the law.[35]There was not a word from all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the gathering of Israel, and the women and the little ones and the stranger going in the midst of them.","Josh.9":"[1]And it will be when all the kings hear which are on the other side Jordan, in the mountain and in the plain, and in all the coast of the great sea, and in front of Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite;[2]And they will gather together to fight with Joshua and with Israel with one mouth.[3]And the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and to Ai.[4]And they will do in guile, and will go and will lay snares, and will take sacking worn out, for their asses, and leather sacks of wine worn out, and being rent and bound up;[5]And shoes worn out and mended, upon their feet, and garments worn out upon them; and all the bread of their food dry; it was crumbs.[6]And they will come to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and will say to him and to the men of Israel, From a land far off we came: and now cut out to us a covenant.[7]And the men of Israel will say to the Hivite, Perhaps thou shalt dwell in the midst of me, and I shall not make a covenant to thee.[8]And they will say to Joshua, We thy servants. And Joshua will say to them, Who are ye? and from whence will ye come?[9]And they will say to him, From a land very far off thy servants came, for the name of Jehovah thy God; for we heard his fame and all that he did in Egypt.[10]And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan, to Sihon, king of Heshbon, and to Og, king of Bashan, in Ashtaroth.[11]And our old men and all the inhabitants of our land will say to us, saying, Take in your hand food for the way, and go to meet them, and say to them, We your servants: and now cut out to us a covenant:[12]This the hot bread we took it for food from our houses in the day we came forth to come to you; and now, behold, it dry, and it was crumbs.[13]And these leather sacks of wine which we filled, new, and behold, they were rent; and these our garments and our shoes worn out from the exceeding greatness of the way.[14]And the men will take of their food, and they asked not the mouth of Jehovah.[15]And Joshua will make peace to them, and will cut out to them a covenant to preserve them alive: and the chiefs of the assembly sware to them.[16]And it will be from the end of three days after they cut out a covenant to them, and they will hear that they are near to him, and they dwell in the midst of him.[17]And the sons of Israel will remove and will come to their cities in the third day. And their cities, Gibeon and Chephirah and Barith, and Kirjath-Jearim.[18]And the sons of Israel smote them not, for the chiefs of the assembly sware to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the assembly will murmur against the chiefs.[19]And all the chiefs will say to all the assembly, We sware to them by Jehovah the God of Israel: and now we shall not be able to touch upon them.[20]This we will do to them, and preserve them alive; and anger shall not be upon us for the oath that we sware to them.[21]And the chiefs will say to them, They shall live; and shall be cutting wood and drawing water to all the assembly as the chiefs spake to them.[22]And Joshua will call to them and will speak to them, saying, For what did ye deceive us, saying, We are very far from you? and ye dwell in the midst of us.[23]And now ye are cursed, and there shall not be cut off from you to serve, and hewing wood and drawing water for the house of my God.[24]And they will answer Joshua, and will say, Because being announced, it was announced to thy servants that Jehovah thy God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all inhabiting the land from before you, and we shall be greatly afraid for our souls from your face; and we shall do this word.[25]And now, behold us in thy hand: as is good and as is right in your eyes to do to us, do.[26]And he will do so to them, and he will deliver them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they slew them not.[27]And Joshua will give them in that day hewing wood and drawing water for the assembly and for the altar of Jehovah till this day, to the place which he shall choose.","Josh.10":"[1]And it will be lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua took Ai and exterminated it; as he did to Jericho and to her king, so he did to Ai and her king; and that the inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Israel, and they will be in the midst of them.[2]And they will fear greatly, for a great city was Gibeon, as one of the cities of the kingdom, and that it was great above Ai, and all her men mighty.[3]And lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, will send to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,[4]Come up to me and help me, and we will smite Gibeon, because she made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.[5]And the five kings of the Amorites will be gathered together and will come up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, they and all their camps, and they will encamp against Gibeon, and they will war against her.[6]And the men of Gibeon will send to Joshua to the camp of Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites inhabiting the mountain gathered themselves together against us.[7]And Joshua will come up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty of strength.[8]And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Thou shalt not be afraid of them, for into thy hands I gave them; a man of them shall not stand before thee.[9]And Joshua will come to them suddenly, all night he went up from Gilgal.[10]And Jehovah will discomfit them before Israel, and will strike them a great blow in Gibeon, and will pursue them the way of the ascent of the house of Horon, and he will strike them even to Azekah and even to Makkedah.[11]And it will be in their fleeing from before Israel, they in the descent of the house of Horon, and Jehovah cast down upon them great stones from the heavens, even to Azekah; and more will die who died by the stones of hail than whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword.[12]Then will Joshua speak to Jehovah in the day Jehovah will give the Amorite before the sons of Israel, and he will say before the eyes of Israel, Sun in Gibeon, be thou silent, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.[13]And the sun will be silent, and the moon stood, till the people will be avenged upon its enemies. Is it not written upon the book of the upright? and the sun will stand in the half of the heavens, and it hasted not to go down for a whole day.[14]And there was not as that day, before it and after it, that Jehovah heard to the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.[15]And Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, to the camp of Gilgal.[16]And these five kings will flee and will hide in a cave in Makkedah.[17]And it will be announced to Joshua, saying, The five kings were found hid in a cave in Makkedah.[18]And Joshua will say, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men over it to watch them.[19]And ye shall not stand; pursue after your enemies; cut off the rear of them; ye shall not give them to come in to their cities, for Jehovah your God gave them into your hand.[20]And it will be when Joshua finished, and the sons of Israel, smiting them an exceeding great blow till he finished them, and they escaping, escaped from them and they will go to the fortified cities.[21]And all the people will turn back to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: and none sharpened his tongue against a man to the sons of Israel.[22]And Joshua will say, Open the mouth of the cave and bring forth to me these five kings out of the cave.[23]And they will do so, and will bring forth to him these five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.[24]And it will be when they brought these kings forth to Joshua, and Joshua will call to every man of Israel, and will say to the leaders of the men of war having gone with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they will come near and put their feet upon their necks.[25]And Joshua will say to them, Ye shall not fear and ye shall not be dismayed; be strong and be active, for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies whom ye war against them.[26]And Joshua will smite them after this, and will kill them, and hang them upon five trees: and they will be hanging upon the trees till evening.[27]And it will be at the time of the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they will take them down from the trees and cast them into the cave where they were hid there; and they will put great stones upon the mouth of the cave till this self-same day.[28]And Joshua took Makkedah in that day, and he will smite her with the mouth of the sword; and her king he exterminated, them, and every soul which was in her; none was left escaping: and he will do to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.[29]And Joshua will pass by and all Israel with him from Makkedah to Libnah, and will fight with Libnah.[30]And Jehovah will also give it into the hand of Israel, and her king: and he will smite it with the mouth of the sword and every soul which is in it; none was left in it escaping; and he will do to her king as he did to the king of Jericho.[31]And Joshua will pass over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and he will encamp against it, and he will fight against it.[32]And Jehovah will give Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he will take it in the second day, and smite it with the mouth of the sword, and every soul which is in it, according to all which he did to Libnah.[33]Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help Lachish;

only every man they smote with the mouth of the sword, till they destroyed them; not any breath was left.[15]As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did: he turned not aside a word from all which Jehovah commanded Moses.[16]And Joshua will take all this land, the mountain and all the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the desert region and the mountain of Israel, and its plain;[17]From the smooth mountain going up to Seir, and even to the lord of Gad in the plains of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and he will smite them and kill them.[18]Many days Joshua made war with all these kings.[19]There was not a city that made peace to the sons of Israel, only the Hivites dwelling in Gibeon; they took all in war.[20]For from Jehovah it was to strengthen their heart to meet Israel in war in order to destroy them; no favor to be to them, but to destroy them as Jehovah commanded Moses.[21]And Joshua will go in that time and will cut off the Anakims from the mountain, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from every mountain of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel, with their cities Joshua exterminated them.[22]An Anakim was not left in the land of the sons of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, they were left.[23]And Joshua will take all the land which Jehovah spake to Moses, and Joshua will give it for an inheritance to Israel according to their portion to their tribes.

And also when Joshua sent them away to their tents he will bless them,[8]And he will say to them, saying, With much riches turn back to your tents, and with exceeding many cattle, with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with exceeding many garments: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.[9]And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh will turn back and will go from the sons of Israel from Shiloh, (which is in the land of Canaan) to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession which they held in it at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.[10]And they will come to the circuits of Jordan, which are in the land of Canaan, and the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh will build there an altar upon Jordan, a great altar for seeing.[11]And the sons of Israel will hear saying, Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh built an altar over against the land of Canaan, at the circuits of Jordan, at the passing over of the sons of Israel.[12]And the sons of Israel will hear, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel will be gathered together at Shiloh to go up to war against them.[13]And the sons of Israel will send to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to half the tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest,[14]And ten chiefs with him, one chief, one chief, to the house of a father for all the tribes of Israel; and each the head of the house of their fathers, these for the thousands of Israel.[15]And they will come to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to half the tribe of Manasseh to the land of Gilead, and they will speak with them, saying,[16]Thus said all the assembly of Jehovah, What transgression this which ye transgressed against the God of Israel to turn back this day from after Jehovah, in your building to you an altar for your rebellion this day against Jehovah?[17]Was the iniquity of Peor little for us, which we were not cleansed from it till this day, and there will be a smiting in the assembly of Jehovah?[18]And will ye turn back this day from after Jehovah? and it will be ye will rebel this day against Jehovah, and to-morrow be will be angry towards all the assembly of Israel.[19]And surely, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over for yourselves to the land of the possession of Jehovah, where the dwelling of Jehovah dwelt there, and take possession in the midst of us: and ye shall not rebel against Jehovah, and ye shall not rebel against us in your building to yourselves an altar beside the altar of Jehovah our God.[20]Did not Achan transgress a transgression in the devoted thing, and upon all the assembly of Israel was wrath? and that man died not alone in his iniquity.[21]And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh will answer and will speak to the heads of the thousands of Israel,[22]The God of gods, Jehovah, the God of gods, Jehovah he will know, and Israel he will know; if in rebellion and if in transgression against Jehovah, thou shalt not save us this day;[23]To build to us an altar to turn back from after Jehovah, and if to bring up upon it a burnt-offering and a gift, and if to do upon it sacrifices of peace Jehovah he will search;[24]And if we did not do this from fear of the word, saying, To-morrow your sons will say to our sons, saying, What to you and to Jehovah the God of Israel.[25]Jehovah gave the bound of our sons and your sons, ye sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; Jordan not to you a part in Jehovah. And your sons caused our sons to cease from fearing Jehovah.[26]And we shall say, We will do now for ourselves to build an altar, not for burnt-offerings and not for sacrifice:[27]But this a witness between us and between you, and between our generations after us, to serve the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace-offerings;

but this a witness between us and between you.[29]Wo to us from him to rebel against Jehovah, and to turn back this day from after Jehovah to build an altar for burnt-offering, for a gift and for sacrifice beside the altar of Jehovah our God which is before his tent.[30]And Phinehas the priest will hear, and the chiefs of the assembly, and the heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spake, and it will be good in their eyes.[31]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest will say to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, This day we knew that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye transgressed not this transgression against Jehovah: then ye delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of Jehovah.[32]And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, will turn back, and the chiefs, from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and will turn back to them the word.[33]And the word will be good in the eves of the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel will bless God, and they said not to go up against them to war to destroy the land which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad dwelt in it.[34]And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad will call to the altar: for it is a witness between us that Jehovah is their God.","Josh.23":"[1]And it will be from many days after that Jehovah caused Israel to rest from all their enemies round about, Joshua was old, gone in days.[2]And Joshua will call to all Israel, to his old men and to his heads and to his judges and to his scribes, and he will say to them, I have become old; I came into days:[3]And ye saw all which Jehovah your God did to all these nations from your face; for Jehovah your God fought for you.[4]See, I cast to you in lot these nations having been left in inheritance to your tribes from Jordan, and all the nations which I cut off, and the great, sea, from the going down of the sun.[5]And Jehovah your God he shall thrust them away from your face and drive them out from before you;

and ye shall not make mention of the name of their gods, and ye shall not swear, and ye shall not serve them, and ye shall not worship to them:[8]But ye shall cleave to Jehovah your God, as ye did even to this day.[9]And Jehovah will drive out from your face great nations and strong: and you, a man stood not before you even to this day.[10]One man from you shall pursue a thousand: for Jehovah your God he fought for you as he spake to you.[11]And watch greatly for your souls, to love Jehovah your God.[12]For if turning back, ye shall turn back and cleave to the remainder of these nations, these being left with you, and marry with them, and go in to them, and they in to you,[13]Knowing, ye shall know that Jehovah your God will not add to drive out these nations from before you: and they, were to you for a snare and for a noose, and for a scourge in your sides, and for thorns in your eyes, till your destruction from this good land which Jehovah your God gave to you.[14]And behold, I go this day in the way of all the earth; and ye knew in all your heart and in all your soul that not one word fell from all the good words which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all came to you; not one word fell from it.[15]And it was as every good word came upon you which Jehovah your God spake to you, so Jehovah will bring upon you every evil word till his destroying you from off this good land which Jehovah your God gave to you.[16]In your passing by the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and ye went and served other gods and worshipped to them;

For the ark of God was in that day and the sons of Israel.[19]And it will be while Saul spake to the priest, and the multitude which was in the camp of the rovers, and it went going and increasing: and Saul will say to the priest, Take back thy hand.[20]And Saul will be convoked and all the people which were with him, and they will go even to the battle: and behold, the sword of a man will be against his neighbor, a very great confusion.[21]And the Hebrews being to the rovers about yesterday the third day, who went up with them into the camp round about, and also they to be with Israel which were with Saul and, Jonathan.[22]And every man of Israel being hid in mount Ephraim, heard that the rovers fled, and they will cleave together, also they after them in the battle.[23]And Jehovah will save Israel in that day: and the battle passed over to the house of nothing.[24]And the man Israel was pressed in that day: and Saul will curse the people, saying, Cursed the men who shall eat bread till the evening, and I was avenged of mine enemy. And all the people tasted not bread.[25]And all the land came into a thicket; and honey will be upon the face of the field.[26]And the people will come to the thicket, and behold, the honey went; and none putting his hand to his mouth, for the people will be afraid of the oath.[27]And Jonathan heard not in his father’s causing the people to swear: and he will stretch forth the extremity of the rod which is in his hand, and he will dip it in the droppings of the honey, and he will turn back his hand to his mouth, and his eyes will see.[28]And a man from the people will answer and say, Thy father adjuring, adjured the people, saying, Cursed the man who shall eat bread this day. And the people were wearied.[29]And Jonathan will say, My father troubled the land: see, now, that mine eyes saw, because I tasted a little of this honey.[30]But if eating, the people ate this day from the spoil of his enemies which he found; for now was not the blow greater against the rovers?[31]And they will strike the rovers in that day, from Michmash to the oak: and the people were greatly wearied.[32]And the people will make to the spoil, and they will take sheep and oxen, and the young of oxen, and they will slaughter on the earth: and the people will eat upon the blood.[33]And they will announce to Saul, saying, Behold, the people sinning against Jehovah to eat upon the blood. And he will say, Ye acted treacherously: roll to me this day a great stone.[34]And Saul will say, Be ye dispersed among the people, and say to them, Bring near to me a man his ox, and a man his sheep, and slaughter here and eat; and ye shall not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood. And all the people will bring near, each his ox in his hand this night, and they will slaughter there.[35]And Saul will build an altar to Jehovah: this altar he began to build to Jehovah.[36]And Saul will say, We will go down after the rovers by night, and we will plunder among them till the light of the morning, and we will not leave a man among them. And they will say, Do all the good in thine eyes. And the priest will say, We will draw near here to God.[37]And Saul will ask in God, Shall I go down after the rovers? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel? And he will not answer him in that day.[38]And Saul will say, Draw near here all the corners of the people: and know and see in what was this sin this day.[39]For Jehovah lives, having saved Israel, for if it is in Jonathan my son, for dying he shall die. And none from all the people answered him.[40]And he will say to all Israel, Ye shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on one side. And the people will say to Saul, Do the good in thine eyes.[41]And Saul will say to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give the truth. And Jonathan will be taken, and Saul: and the people will come forth.[42]And Saul will say, Cast between me and between Jonathan my son. And Jonathan will be taken.[43]And Saul will say to Jonathan, Announce to me what thou didst And Jonathan will announce to him and say, Tasting, I tasted with the extremity of the rod which was in my hand, a little honey, and behold, I shall die.[44]And Saul will say, So will Jehovah do, and so will he add; for dying, thou shalt die, Jonathan.[45]And the people will say to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who did this great salvation in Israel? Far be it: Jehovah lives if there shall fall from the hair of his head to the earth; for he did with Jehovah this day. And the people will let Jonathan go free, and he died not.[46]And Saul will come up from after the rovers: and the rovers went to their place.[47]And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and he will fight round about against all his enemies, against Moab and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the rovers: and in all which he will turn he will disturb.[48]And he will do in strength, and he will strike Amalek, and deliver Israel from the hand of him plundering him.[49]And the sons of Saul will be Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchisua; and the names of his two daughters, the name of the first-born, Merab, and the name of the small, Michal.[50]And the name of Saul’s wife Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the chief of his army, Abner, son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.[51]And Kish the father of Saul: and Ner the father of Abner, son of Abiel.[52]And strong war will be against the rovers all the days of Saul: and Saul seeing every strong man and every son of strength, and he will gather him to him.","1Sam.15":"[1]And Samuel will say to Israel, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee for king over his people, over Israel: and now hear to the voice of the words of Jehovah.[2]Thus said Jehovah of armies, I reviewed what Amalek did to Israel, how he set for him in the way in his going up out of Egypt.[3]Now go and strike Amalek, and exterminate all which is to him, and thou shalt not spare to him; and kill from man even to woman, from child even to suckling, from ox and even to sheep, from camel and even to ass.[4]And Saul will cause the people to hear, and he will review them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.[5]And Saul will come even to a city of Amalek, and he will lie in wait by the torrent.[6]And Saul will say to the Kenite, Go, remove, go down from the midst of the Amalekites, lest I shall add thee with him; for ye did mercy with all the sons of Israel in their coming up out of Egypt And the Kenite will remove from the midst of Amalek.[7]And Saul will strike Amalek from Havilah thy coming to Shur, which is upon the face of Egypt.[8]And he will seize Agag, king of Amalek, living, and be exterminated all the people with the mouth of the sword.[9]And Saul and the people will have pity upon Agag, and upon the good of the sheep, and the oxen and the double, and upon the lambs and upon all the good, and they were not willing to exterminate them: and every work despised and wasting away, they exterminated it.[10]And the word of Jehovah will be to Samuel, saying,[11]I lamented that I made Saul for king, for he turned back from after me, and my words he set not up. And it will kindle to Samuel, and he will cry to Jehovah all the night.[12]And Samuel will rise early to meet Saul in the morning, and it will be announced to Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he sets up to him a hand, and he will turn round and pass over and go down to Gilgal.[13]And Samuel will come to Saul: and Saul will say to him, Blessed thou of Jehovah: I set up the word of Jehovah.[14]And Samuel will say, And what the voice of sheep in mine ear, and the voice of the oxen which I hear?[15]And Saul will say, From the Amalekites they brought them; which the people had pity upon the good of the sheep and of the oxen in order to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we exterminated.[16]And Samuel will say to Saul, Desist, and I will announce to thee what Jehovah spake to me by night. And they will say to him, Speak.[17]And Samuel will say, Wert thou not little in thine eyes, thou the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah will anoint thee for king over Israel?[18]And Jehovah will send thee in the way, and he will say, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners Amalek, and fight against him even till ye consumed them.[19]And wherefore didst thou not hear to the voice of Jehovah, and wilt clothe thyself with the spoil, and thou wilt do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah.[20]And Saul will say to Samuel, That I heard to the voice of Jehovah, and I will go in the way which Jehovah sent me, and I will bring Agag king of Amalek, and I utterly destroyed Amalek.[21]And the people will take from the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief devoted to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.[22]And Samuel will say, Was it pleasing to Jehovah in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as to hear to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to hear, above a good sacrifice, and to hearken, above the fat of rams.[23]For the sin of divination, rebellion; and deceit, and the family gods of stubbornness. Because thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and he will reject thee from being king.[24]And Saul will say to Samuel, I sinned: for I passed by the mouth of Jehovah, and thy words: for I feared the people and I will hear to their voice.[25]And now, take away now, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship to Jehovah.[26]And Samuel will say to Saul, I will not turn back with thee, for thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah will reject thee from being king over Israel.[27]And Samuel will turn about to go, and he will seize upon the wing of his upper garment, and it will rend.[28]And Samuel will say to him, Jehovah rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and gave it to thy neighbor being good above thee.[29]And also the glory of Israel will not lie, and he will not lament: for he not a man to lament.[30]And he will say, I sinned this time; honor me now before the old men of my people, and before Israel, and turn back with me, and I worshipped to Jehovah thy God.[31]And Samuel will turn back after Saul; and Saul will worship to Jehovah.[32]And Samuel will say, Bring near to me Agag king of Amalek. And Agag will come to him, wavering: and Agag will say, Surely the bitterness of death was removed.[33]And Samuel will say, As thy sword bereaved women of children, so of women shall thy mother be bereaved of children. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.[34]And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house of the hill of Saul.[35]And Samuel will not add to see Saul, even to the day of his death: for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah lamented that he made Saul king over Israel.","1Sam.16":"[1]And Jehovah will say to Samuel, How long mournest thou for Saul, and I rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and go; I will send thee to Jesse of the House of Bread, for I saw among his sons a king to me.[2]And Samuel will say, How shall I go? and Saul hearing, and killing me. And Jehovah will say, Thou shalt take a heifer of the cows in thy hand and say, To sacrifice to Jehovah I came.[3]And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to thee what thou shalt do: and anoint to me whom I say to thee.[4]And Samuel will do what Jehovah spake, and he will go to the House of Bread. And the old men of the city will tremble to meet him, and say, Thy coming peace?[5]And he will say, Peace: to sacrifice to Jehovah I came: be ye consecrated and come with me to the sacrifice. And he will consecrate Jesse and his sons, and call for them to the sacrifice.[6]And it will be in their coming, and he will see Eliab, and he said, Surely, before Jehovah his Messiah.[7]And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Thou shalt not look upon his aspect or upon the height of his stature; for I rejected him: for not what man will see, for man will see with the eyes, and Jehovah will see at the heart.[8]And Jesse will call for Abinadab, and he will cause him to pass by before Samuel. And he will say, Also this Jehovah chose not.[9]And Jesse will cause Shammah to pass by. And he will say, Also in this Jehovah chose not.[10]And Jesse will cause seven of his sons to pass by before Samuel: and Samuel will say to Jesse, Jehovah chose not in these.[11]And Samuel will say to Jesse, Are these the whole of the boys? And he will say, The small was yet left, and behold, he fed among the sheep. And Samuel will say to Jesse, Send and take him, for we will not turn about till his coming here.[12]And he will send and bring him. And he red, with beauty of eyes, and good of sight And Jehovah will say, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.[13]And Samuel will take the horn of oil and he will anoint him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit of Jehovah will cleave to David from that day and over. And Samuel will rise and go to Ramab.[14]And the spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah terrified him.[15]And Saul’s servants will say to him, Behold now, an evil spirit of God terrifying thee.[16]Will our lord now say to thy servants before thee, Seek out a man knowing to play upon the harp: and it was in the evil spirit of God being upon thee, and he playing with the hand and doing good to thee.[17]And Saul will say to his servants, See, now, a man to me being good to play, and bring to me.[18]And one of his boys will answer and say, I saw a son to Jesse of the House of Bread, knowing to play, mighty of strength, and a man of war, and discerning the word, and a man of figure, and Jehovah with him.[19]And Saul will send messengers to Jesse, and he will say, Send to me David thy son who is with the sheep.[20]And Jesse will take a heap of bread and a sack of wine, and one kid of the goats, and he will send by the hand of David his son to Saul.[21]And David will come to Saul, and stand before him: and he will love him greatly; and he will be to him lifting up the arms.[22]And Saul will send to Jesse, saying, David shall stand now before me, for he found grace in mine eyes.[23]And it was in the spirit of God being upon Saul, and David took the harp and played with his hand, and it was refreshed to Saul, and it was good to him, and the evil spirit departed from him.","1Sam.17":"[1]And the rovers will gather together their camps for war, and they will gather together at Shocoth, which is to Judah, and they will encamp between Shocoth and between Azekah, in the end of Damim.[2]And Saul and the man Israel were gathered together, and they will encamp in the valley of Elah, and they arranged the battle to meet the rovers.[3]And the rovers standing on the mountain from hence, and Israel standing on the mountain from thence, and the valley between them.[4]And there went forth a man of the sons of the camp of the rovers, Goliah his name, from Gath; his height six cubits and a span.[5]And a helmet of brass upon his head, and a coat of mail of scales he put on; and the weight of the coat of mail five thousand shekels of brass.[6]And brass fronts upon his feet, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.[7]And the arrow of his spear as the beam of weavers, and the flame of his spear, six hundred shekels of iron. And he lifting up a shield went before him.[8]And he will stand and call to the ranks of Israel, and say to them, Wherefore will ye come forth to arrange the battle? am not I of the rovers, and ye servants to Saul? select to yourselves a man, and he shall come down to me.[9]If he shall be able to war with me and strike me, and we were to you for servants: and if I shall be able against him and strike him, and ye were to us for servants, and ye served us.[10]And he of the rovers will say, I upbraided the ranks of Israel this day; ye shall give to me a man and we will fight together.[11]And Saul will hear and all Israel, these words of him of the rovers, and they will be terrified and greatly afraid.[12]And David, son of a man, that Ephrathite, of the House of Bread of Judah, and his name Jesse; and to him eight sons; and the man in the days of Saul went an old man among men.[13]And three sons of Jesse, the great ones, going, went after Saul to war: and the names of his three sons which went in the war, Eliab the first-born and his second, Abinadab, and the third, Shammah.[14]And David, he the small; and the three great ones went after Saul.[15]And David went and turned back from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at the House of Bread.[16]And he of the rovers will draw near, the morning and the evening, and he will take a stand forty days.[17]And Jesse will say to David his son, Take now to thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and this ten of bread, and run to the camp to thy brethren.[18]And these ten cuttings of milk thou shalt bring to the chief of a thousand; and thou shalt review thy brethren for peace, and take their pledge.[19]And Saul, and they, and every man of Israel, in the valley of Elah, warring with the rovers.[20]And David will rise early in the morning, and will cast the sheep upon a watcher, and he will lift up and go as Jesse commanded him; and he will come to the track, and the army going forth to the array and they shouted in the war.[21]And Israel will arrange, and the rovers, array to meet array.[22]And David will cast the utensils from off him upon the hand of the watcher of the utensils, and be will run to the array, and will come and ask to his brethren for peace.[23]And he speaking with them, and behold, a man of the sons came up, Goliah of the rovers, his name, from Gath, from the ranks of the rovers: and he will speak according to these words, and David will hear.[24]And every man of Israel in their seeing the man, will flee from his face, and they will fear greatly.[25]And the man Israel will say, Saw ye this man coming up? for to upbraid Israel he came up: and it was the man who shall strike him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give to him his daughter, and his father’s house he will make free in Israel.[26]And David will say to the men standing with him, saying, What shall be done to the man who shall strike this one of the rovers, and take away the reproach from Israel? for who this uncircumcised of the rovers? for he upbraided the ranks of the living God.[27]And the people will say to him according to this word, saying, Thus it shall be done to the man who shall smite him.[28]And Eliab his brother the great, will hear in his speaking to the men, and Eliab’s anger will kindle against David, and he will say, Why this camest thou down? and upon whom didst thou cast those few sheep in the desert?

For this they will say, Is Saul also among the prophets.","1Sam.20":"[1]And David will flee from Naioth in Ramah, and he will come and say before Jonathan, What did I? and what mine iniquity? and what my sin before thy father that he seeks my soul?[2]And he will say to him, Far be it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will not do a word great or a word small, and not disclose mine ear: and wherefore will my father hide from me this word? this is not.[3]And David will yet swear and say, Knowing, thy father knew that I found grace in thine eyes; and he will say, Jonathan shall not know this, lest he shall be grieved: but yet Jehovah lives and thy soul lives, for but a step between me and between death.[4]And Jonathan will say to David, What thy soul will say, and I will do for thee.[5]And David will say to Jonathan, Behold, the new moon to-morrow, and I sitting, shall sit down with the king to eat: and thou sentest me away and I was hid in the field till the evening of the third.[6]If reviewing, thy father shall review me, and thou saidst, Asking, David asked of me to run to the House of Bread, his city; for a sacrifice of days there to all the family.[7]If thus he shall say, Good; peace to thy servant; and if kindling, it shall kindle to him, know that evil was finished with him.[8]And do thou mercy with thy servant; for into a covenant of Jehovah thou didst bring thy servant with thee: and if there is iniquity in me, do thou kill me; and wherefore wilt thou bring me even to thy father?[9]And Jonathan will say, Far be it to thee: that if knowing, I shall know that evil was finished with my father to come upon thee, shall I not announce it to thee?[10]And David will say to Jonathan, Who shall announce to me? or what if thy father shall answer thee harshly?[11]And Jonathan will say to David, Come, and we will go forth to the field. And they two went forth to the field.[12]And Jonathan will say to David, Jehovah, God of Israel when I shall search out my father about this time to-morrow, the third day, and behold, good to David, and I shall not then send to thee, and uncover thine ear.[13]Thus shall Jehovah do to Jonathan, and thus shall he add; for it shall be good to my father with evil to thee, and I uncovered thine ear and sent thee away, and thou wentest in peace: and Jehovah will be with thee as he was with my father.[14]And not only while yet I live and wilt thou not do the mercy of Jehovah with me, and I shall not die.[15]And thou shalt not cut off thy mercy from my house, even forever: and not in Jehovah’s cutting off the enemies of David a man from the face of the earth.[16]And Jonathan will cut out with the house of David, and Jehovah sought out from the hand of David’s enemies.[17]And Jonathan will add to cause David to swear in his loving him; as loving his soul he loved him.[18]And Jonathan will say to him, To-morrow the new moon: and thou wert reviewed, for thy seat will be reviewed.[19]And the third day thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide there in the day of the work, and thou shalt sit by the stone of rolling:[20]And I will shoot three arrows of the side, to send to me for a mark.[21]And behold, I will send the boy: Go find the arrows. If saying, I say to the boy, Behold, the arrows from thee, and behold, take it: and come, for peace to thee, and not a word; Jehovah lives.[22]And if saying thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows from thee, and forward; go: for Jehovah sent thee away.[23]And the word which we spake, I and thou, behold, Jehovah between me and between thee forever.[24]And David will hide in the field: and it will be the new moon, and the king will sit down to the bread to eat.[25]And the king will sit upon his seat as from time to time, to a seat of the wall: and Jonathan will rise, and Abner will sit by Saul’s side, and David’s seat will be reviewed.[26]And Saul spake not anything in that day, for he said, It is an accident; he is not clean; for he is not clean.[27]And on the morrow, of the month the second, and David’s place will be reviewed: and Saul will say to Jonathan his son, Wherefore came not the son of Jesse also yesterday, also this day to the bread?[28]And Jonathan will answer to Saul, Asking, David asked of me even for the House of Bread:[29]And he will say, Send me away now, for a sacrifice of the family to us in the city; and my brother he commanded me: and now if I found grace in thine eyes, I will slip away now and see my brethren. For this he came not to the table of the king.[30]And Saul’s anger will kindle against Jonathan, and he will say to him, Son of crooked rebelliousness, did I not know that thou choosest to the son of Jesse to thy shame and to the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?[31]For all the days which the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, thou shalt not stand, and thy kingdom. And now send and take him to me, for he is the son of death.[32]And Jonathan will answer Saul his father and say to him, Wherefore shall he die? What did he?[33]And Saul will lift up his spear against him to strike him, and Jonathan will know that it was finished from his father to kill David.[34]And Jonathan will rise from the table in the heat of wrath, and he will not eat bread in the day of the month the second, for he was grieved for David because his father reproached him.[35]And it will be in the morning, and Jonathan will go forth to the field to the appointment, David and a small boy with him.[36]And he will say to the boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot The boy ran, and he shot the arrows beyond him.[37]And the boy will go even to the place of the arrows which Jonathan shot, and Jonathan will call after the boy and say, Is not the arrow from thee and forward?[38]And Jonathan will call after the boy, Be quick, hasten, thou shalt not stand. And Jonathan’s boy will take up the arrows and come to his lord.[39]And the boy knew not anything: but Jonathan and David knew the word.[40]And Jonathan will give his utensils to the boy that is to him, and he will say to him, Go, bring into the city.[41]The boy went, and David rose from the south side, and fell upon his face to the earth, and they will worship three times, and they will kiss each his friend, and they will weep, each with his friend, till David magnified.[42]And Jonathan will say to David, Go for peace, for we sware, we two, in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will be between me and between thee, and between my seed and between thy seed, even forever.

And say thou, Also thy servant, Uriah the Hittite died.[22]And the messenger will go, and come and announce to David all that for which Joab sent him.[23]And the messenger will say to David, That the men were strengthened upon us, and they came out to us to the field, and they were upon them, even to the door of the gate.[24]And they beholding, aimed at thy servants from above the wall: and from the servants of the king will die, and also thy servant, Uriah the Hittite died.[25]And David will say to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, This same word shall not be evil in thine eyes, as this, and as this, the sword shall consume: strengthen thy battle against the city and pull it down: and strengthen yourselves.[26]And Uriah’s wife will hear that Uriah her husband died, and she will mourn for her lord.[27]And the mourning will pass over, and David will send and take her to his house, and she will be to him for wife, and bear to him a son. And the word which David did will be evil in the eyes of Jehovah.","2Sam.12":"[1]And Jehovah will send Nathan to David. And he will come in to him and say to him, Two men were in one city; one rich and one poor.[2]To the rich was sheep and oxen exceeding many:[3]And to the poor, not anything except one little ewe lamb which he found, and he will save it alive: and it will grow with him and with his sons together; it will eat from his morsel and will drink from his cup, and will lie in his bosom, and be to him as a daughter.[4]And a traveler will come to the rich man, and he will spare to take from his sheep and from his oxen to do for the wayfarer coming to him; and he will take the poor man’s ewe lamb and do for the man coming to him.[5]And David’s anger will kindle against the man greatly, and he will say to Nathan, Jehovah lives, for the man doing this is the son of death.[6]And the ewe lamb he shall requite four-fold, because he did this word, and because he spared not.[7]And Nathan will say to David, Thou the man. Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, I anointed thee for king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;[8]And I will give thee the house of thy lord and thy lord’s wives into thy bosom, and I will give to thee the house of Israel and Judah; and if little, I will add to thee according to these and according to these.[9]Wherefore didst thou despise the word of Jehovah to do evil in his eyes? Uriah the Hittite thou didst strike with the sword, and his wife thou tookest to thee for a wife, and thou didst kill him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.[10]And now the sword shall not depart from thy house even to forever; because that thou didst despise me, and thou wilt take the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to thee for wife.[11]Thus said Jehovah, Behold me raising up evil against thee from thy house, and I took thy wives before thine eyes and gave to thy neighbor, and he lay with thy wives before the eyes of this sun.[12]For thou didst in secret: and I will do this word before all Israel, and before the sun.[13]And David will say to Nathan, I sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan will say to David, Jehovah also passed over thy sin; thou shalt not die.[14]Only that despising, thou didst cause the enemies of Jehovah to despise by this thing, also the son born to thee, dying, shall die.[15]And Nathan will go to his house. And Jehovah will strike the child which Uriah’s wife bare to David and he will be sick.[16]And David will seek God for the boy, and fast a fast; and he came and passed the night and lay upon the earth.[17]And the old men of his house will rise to him to lift him up from the earth; and he would not, and he ate not bread with them.[18]And it will be in the seventh day, and the child will die. And David’s servants feared to announce to him that the child died: for they said, Behold, in the child being living we spake to him and he heard not to our voice, and how shall we say to him the child died, and do evil?[19]And David will see that his servants are whispering, and David will perceive that the child died: and David will say to his servants, Did the child die? and they will say, He died.[20]And David will rise from the earth and wash, and be anointed, and he will change his garments, and will go into the house of Jehovah and worship, and go to his house; and he will ask and they will set bread to him, and he will eat.[21]And his servants will say to him, What this word which thou didst? for sake of the child living thou didst fast and weep, and when the child died thou didst rise and thou wilt eat bread.[22]And he will say, The child yet living, and I fasted and wept; for I said, Who will know Jehovah will compassionate me, and the child live?[23]And now he died, wherefore thus do I fast? shall I be able to yet turn him back? I go to him, and he will not turn back to me.[24]And David will comfort Bath-Sheba his wife, and will go in to her and lie with her, and she will bear a son, and he will call his name Solomon: and Jehovah loved him.[25]And he will send by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he will call his name Jedidiah, for sake of Jehovah.[26]And Joab will fight against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and he will take the city of the kingdom.[27]And Joab will send messengers to David, and say, I fought against Rabbah, also I took the city of waters.[28]And now gather together the rest of the people and encamp against the city, and take it, lest I shall take the city, and my name was called upon it.[29]And David will gather all the people together and go to Rabbah, and war against it and take it.[30]And he will take the crown of their king from his head; and its weight a talent of gold and a precious stone; and it will be upon David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much.[31]And the people which were in it he brought forth, and he will put at the saw and at the threshing-sledge of iron, and at axes of iron, and caused them to pass over through the brick-kiln: and thus he will do to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David will turn back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.","2Sam.13":"[1]And it will be after this, and to Absalom son of David a fair sister, and her name Tamar; and Amnon, son of David, loved her.[2]And Amnon will be pressed to be sick for sake of Tamar his sister, for she was a virgin; and it will be hard in the eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.[3]And to Amnon a friend, and his name Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David’s brother: and Jonadab a man exceeding wise.[4]And he will say to him, Wherefore thou so weak, son of the king, in morning by morning? wilt thou not announce to me? and Amnon will say to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.[5]And Jonadab will say to him, Lie upon thy bed and be sick, and thy father coming to see thee, and say to him, Now my sister Tamar shall come and give me to eat bread and make the food before mine eyes, so that I shall see and eat from her hand.[6]And Amnon will lie down and be sick: and the king will come to see him, and Amnon will say to the king, Will Tamar my sister come now, and she shall make before mine eyes two cakes, and I will eat from her hand.[7]And David will send to Tamar, saying, Go now to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make food for him.[8]And Tamar will go to the house of Amnon her brother, and he lay down. And she will take dough and knead, and make cakes before his eyes, and bake the cakes.[9]And she will take a frying-pan and pour out before him; and he will refuse to eat. And Amnon will say, Bring out every man from me. And they brought forth every man from him.[10]And Amnon will say to Tamar, Bring the cakes into the chamber, and I will eat from thine hand And Tamar will take the cakes which she made and bring to Amnon her brother into the chamber.[11]And she will bring near to him to eat, and he will lay hold upon her and say, Come lie with me, my sister.[12]And she will say to him, No, my brother, thou shalt not humble me; for so it shall not be done in Israel: thou shalt not do this folly.[13]And I, whither shall I cause my reproach to go? and thou wilt be as one of the foolish in Israel. And now, speak now, to the king, and he will not withhold me from thee.[14]And he would not hear to her voice; and he will be strong above her, and he will humble her and lie with her.[15]And Amnon will hate her with great hatred, greatly; for great the hatred which he hated her above the love which he loved her. And Amnon will say to her, Arise, go.[16]And she will say to him, No reasons: this evil great above the other which thou didst with me, to send me away. And he would not hear to her.[17]And he will call his boy serving him, and say, Send away now this from me without, and fasten the door after her.[18]And upon her a tunic reaching to the soles of the feet; for thus will the king’s daughters, the virgins, be clothed with upper garments. And his attendant will bring her forth without, and he fastened the door after.[19]And Tamar will take ashes upon her head, and she rent the tunic reaching to the feet which was upon her, and she will put her hand upon her head and will go, going and crying.[20]And Absalom her brother will say to her Was Amnon thy brother with thee? and now my sister be silent, he is thy brother; thou shalt not set thy heart to this word. And Tamar will remain, and she was desolate in the house of Absalom her brother.[21]And king David heard all the words and it will kindle to him greatly.[22]And Absalom spake not with Amnon, from evil and even to good: for Absalom hated Amnon for the word that he humbled Tamar his sister.[23]And it will be for two years of days, and shearers will be to Absalom in Baal-Hazor, which is with Ephraim: and Absalom will call for all the king’s sons.[24]And Absalom will come to the king and say, Behold now, shearers to thy servant: now will the king go, and his servants, with thy servant?[25]And the king will say to Absalom, No, my son, not now will we all go, and we will not be heavy upon thee. And he will press upon him, and he would not go, and he will bless him.[26]And Absalom will say, And shall not Amnon my brother now go with us? And the king will say to him, Wherefore shall he go with thee?[27]And Absalom will press upon him, and he will send with him Amnon and all the king’s sons.[28]And Absalom will command his boys, saying, See now, when the heart of Amnon is good with wine, and I said to you, Strike Amnon; and kill him; ye shall not be afraid, for I commanded you: be strong and be for sons of strength.[29]And Absalom’s boys will do to Amnon as Absalom commanded. And all the king’s sons will rise up and ride each upon his mule and flee.[30]And it will be they in the way, and the report came to David saying, Absalom struck all the king’s sons and not one remaining of them.[31]And the king will rise and rend his garments, and will lie down upon the earth; and all his servants standing by with their garments rent.[32]And Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David’s brother, will answer and say, My lord shall not say, All the boys, the king’s sons, were slain; for Amnon alone died; for by the mouth of Absalom it was set from the day he humbled Tamar his sister.[33]And now my lord the king shall not set to his heart the word, saying, All the king’s sons died; for only Amnon alone died.[34]And Absalom will flee. And the boy watching will lift up his eyes and see, and behold, much people coming from the way behind him from the side of the mountain.[35]And Jonadab will say to the king, Behold, the king’s sons came; as thy servant spake, so it was.[36]And it will be as he finished to speak, and behold, the king’s sons came, and they will lift up their voice and weep: and the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping.[37]And Absalom fled and went to Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And he will mourn for his son all the days.[38]And Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and he will be there three years.[39]And David the king was fixed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted for Amnon, for he died.","2Sam.14":"[1]And Joab son of Zeruiah, knew that the king’s heart was for Absalom.[2]And Joab will send to Tekoah and take from thence a wise woman, and he will say to her, Thou shalt mourn, and put on now garments of mourning, and thou shalt not be anointed with oil, and be thou as a woman this many days mourning for the dead:[3]And come to the king and speak to him according to this word. And Joab will put words in her mouth.[4]And the woman, the Tekoite, will speak to the king and fall upon her face to the earth, and worship him, and say, Save, O king![5]And the king will say to her, What to thee? And she will say, Truly I a widow woman, and my husband will die.[6]And to thy servant two sons, and they two will strive in the field, and none delivering between them; and the one will smite the one and kill him.[7]And behold, all the family rose up against thy servant, and they will say, Give him striking his brother and we will kill him for the soul of his brother whom he slew; and they destroyed also the heir, and quenched my coal which was left, so that name was not set to my husband and remainder upon the face of the earth.[8]And the king will say to the woman, Go to thy house and I will command concerning thee.[9]And the woman, the Tekoite, will say to the king, Upon me, my lord the king, the iniquity, and upon my father’s house: and the king and his throne innocent.[10]And the king will say, Who speaking to thee and bring him to me and he shall not add to touch upon thee.[11]And she will say, The king will remember now, Jehovah thy God, the nearest relation of blood being multiplied to destroy, and they shall not destroy my son. And he will say, Jehovah living, if there shall fall from the hair of thy son to the earth.[12]And the woman will say, Shall thy servant speak now a word to my lord the king? And the king will say, Speak.[13]And the woman will say, And wherefore didst thou reckon according to this concerning the people of God? for the king speaks this word as transgressing for the king not to turn back his fugitive.[14]For dying, we shall die, and as waters poured out on the earth, which will not be gathered; and God will not lift up the soul: and reckoning, he reckons that the fugitive shall not be driven out from him.[15]And now that I came to speak to the king my lord, this word, for the people will see me, and thy servant will say, I will speak now to the king, perhaps the king will do the word of his servant.[16]For the king will hear to deliver his servant from the band of the man destroying me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.[17]And thy servant will say, Now will the word of my lord the king be for a sacrifice, for as a messenger of God, so my lord the king to hear the good and the evil: and Jehovah thy God will be with thee.[18]And the king will answer and say to the woman, Now thou shalt not hide from me the word which I ask thee. And the woman will say, Now will my lord the king speak?[19]And the king will say, The hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman will answer and say, Thy soul living, my lord the king, if there is to the right or to the left from all which my lord the king spake: for thy servant Joab he commanded me, and he put in the mouth of thy servant all these words.[20]For the sake of turning about the face of the word, thy servant Joab did this word: and my lord was wise according to the wisdom of a messenger of God, to know all which is upon the earth.[21]And the king will say to Joab, Behold now, I did this word: and go and turn back the boy Absalom.[22]And Joab will fall upon his face to the earth, and worship him, and bless the king: and Joab will say, This day thy servant knew that I found grace in thine eyes, my lord, O king, for that the king did the word of his servant.[23]And Joab will rise and go to Geshur and bring Absalom to Jerusalem.[24]And the king will say, He shall turn about to his house and not see my face. And Absalom will turn to his house and not see the face of the king.[25]And as Absalom there was not a fair man in all Israel to praise greatly: from the sole of his foot and even to his crown, there was not a blemish in him.[26]And in his shaving his head (and it was from the end of days to days that he will shave, for it was heavy upon him;) and he shaved and weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the stone of the king.[27]And there will be born to Absalom three sons and one daughter, and her name Tamar: she was a woman of fair aspect.[28]And Absalom dwelt in Jerusalem two years of days, and saw not the king’s face.[29]And Absalom will send to Joab to send him to the king, and he would not come to him: and he will send yet the second time, and he would not come.[30]And he will say to his servants, See, Joab’s portion to my hand, and barley to him there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the portion on fire.[31]And Joab will rise and come to Absalom to the house, and say to him, Wherefore did thy servants set on fire the portion which is to me?[32]And Absalom will say to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, and I will send thee to the king, saying, Wherefore came I from Geshur? Good to me even I was there: and now I will see the king’s face; and if there is iniquity in me, and kill me.[33]And Joab will come to the king and announce to him: and he will call for Absalom, and he will come to the king and worship to him upon his face to the earth before the king: and the king will kiss Absalom.","2Sam.15":"[1]And it will be from after this, and Absalom will make to him chariots and horses, and fifty men running before him.[2]And Absalom rose early and stood by the hand of the way of the gate: and it will be every man which shall be to him strife coming to the king for judgment, and Absalom will call to him and say, Where, from what city thou? And he will say, of one of the tribes of Israel is thy servant.[3]And Absalom will say to him, See, thy words good and straight, and none to hear to thee from the king.[4]And Absalom will say, Who will set me judge in the land? and to me shall every man come which shall be to him strife and judgment, and I did him justice.[5]And it was in a man’s coming near to worship to him, and he stretched forth his hand and laid hold of him, and kissed him.[6]And Absalom will do according to this word to all Israel who will come for judgment to the king: and Absalom will steal the heart of the men of Israel.[7]And it will be from the end of forty years, and Absalom will say to the king, I will go now and complete my vow which I vowed to Jehovah in Hebron.[8]For thy servant vowed a vow in my dwelling in Geshur in Aram, saying, If turning back, Jehovah shall turn me back to Jerusalem, and I served Jehovah.[9]And the king will say to him, Go in peace. And he will rise and go to Hebron.[10]And Absalom will send spies in all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye heard the voice of the trumpet, and ye said, Absalom the king in Hebron.[11]And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, being called; going uprightly, and they knew not any word.[12]And Absalom will send for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, in his sacrificing sacrifices. And the conspiracy will be strong; and the people went and a multitude with Absalom.[13]And he announcing, will come to David, saying, The heart of the man Israel was after Absalom.[14]And David will say to all his servants which are with him in Jerusalem, Arise, and we will flee, for escape will not be to us from the face of Absalom: hasten to go lest he shall hasten to hedge us in, and thrust evil upon us, and smite the city with the mouth of the sword.[15]And the king’s servants will say to the king, According to all which my lord the king shall choose, behold thy servants.[16]And the king will go forth, and all his house at his feet. And the king will leave ten women, concubines, to watch the house.[17]And the king will go forth, and all the people at his feet, and they will stand in a house far off.[18]And all his servants passing by upon his hand; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came at his foot from Gath, passing by at the face of the king.[19]And the king will say to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore wilt thou go, also thou, with us? turn back and dwell with the king, for thou a stranger and thou an exile to thy place.[20]Yesterday thy coming, and this day shall I cause thee to wander about to go with us? and I go where I go, turn back, and turn back thy brethren with thee mercy and truth.[21]And Ittai will answer the king, and say, Jehovah lives, and my lord the king lives, for surely in the place where my lord the king shall be, there whether for death, whether for life, for there will thy servant be.[22]And David will say to Ittai, Go and pass over.

I will pass over now and take away his head.[10]And the king will say, What to me and you ye sons of Zeruiah? for he shall curse, and because Jehovah said to him, Curse David: and who shall say, Wherefore didst thou thus?[11]And David will say to Abishai and to all his servants, Behold my son who came forth from my bowels seeks my soul: and how much more now the son of the Jaminite? Leave to him and he shall curse, for Jehovah said to him.[12]Perhaps Jehovah will look upon my wrong, and Jehovah turn back to me good for his cursing this day.[13]And David went, and his men, in the way; and Shimei went by the side of the mountain near to him going, and he will curse and stone with stones near to him, and dusting with dust.[14]And the king will come, and all the people which are with him, weary, and he will be refreshed there.[15]And Absalom and all the people, the man Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.[16]And it will be, as Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, and Hushai will say to Absalom, The king shall live, the king shall live.[17]And Absalom will say to Hushai, This thy mercy with thy friend? wherefore wentest thou not with thy friend?[18]And Hushai will say to Absalom, Nay; for whom Jehovah chose and this people, and every man of Israel, shall I not be and dwell with him?[19]And the second time, to whom shall I serve if not before the son? as I served before thy father so will I be before thee.[20]And Absalom will say to Ahithophel, Bring counsel to yourselves what we shall do.[21]And Ahithophel will say to Absalom, Come in to thy father’s concubines which he left to watch the house; and all Israel hearing that thou madest thy father loathsome, and the hands of all that are with thee were strengthened.[22]And they will stretch out a tent for Absalom upon the roof, and Absalom will go in to his father’s concubines before the eyes of all Israel.[23]And the counsel of Ahithophel which he counseled in those days, according as it will be asked in the word of God: thus all the counsel of Ahithophel also to David also to Absalom.","2Sam.17":"[1]And Ahithophel will say to Absalom, I will now choose twelve thousand men, and I will rise and pursue after David this night:[2]And I shall come upon him and he being weary and relaxed in hands, and I made him afraid: and all the people which are with him, fleeing; and I struck the king alone,[3]And I will turn back all the people to thee: as the turning back of all, the man whom thou seekest; and to all the people shall be peace.[4]And the word will be straight in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the old men of Israel.[5]And Absalom will say, Call now also for Hushai the Archite, and we will hear also, what is in his mouth.[6]And Hushai will come to Absalom, and Absalom will say to him, saying, According to this word spake Ahithophel: shall we do his word? if not, speak thou.[7]And Hushai will say to Absalom, The counsel which Ahithophel counseled is not good in this time.[8]And Hushai will say, Thou knewest thy father and his men that they are mighty, and they bitter of soul as a bear bereaved of offspring in the field: and thy father a man of war, and he will not lodge with the people.[9]Behold now, he hid in one of the pits, or in one of the places: and it being when there fell among them in the beginning, and he hearing heard and said, was a slaughter among the people which are after Absalom.[10]And he also the son of strength whose heart according to the heart of the lion, melting, will melt away: for all Israel knew that thy father is mighty, and the sons of strength which are with him.[11]For I counseled being gathered, all Israel shall be gathered to thee from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, as the sand which is upon the sea for multitude; and thy face going in the midst of them.[12]And we came upon him in one of the places which we shall find there, and we upon him as the dew will fall upon the earth: and we will not leave of him and of all the men which are with him, even one.[13]And if he shall be gathered into the city, and all Israel shall lift up ropes to that city, and we dragged it even to the torrent, till we shall not find there even a stone.[14]And Absalom will say, and every man of Israel, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is good above the counsel of Ahithophel. And Jehovah commanded to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel so that Jehovah brought evil upon Absalom.[15]And Hushai will say to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, According to this, and according to this, Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the old men of Israel; and according to this and according to this, I counseled.[16]And now send quickly and announce to David, saying, Thou wilt not lodge this night in Araboth of the desert, and also passing over, thou shalt pass over, lest he shall swallow up to the king and to all the people which are with him.[17]And Jonathan and Ahimaaz standing by the fountain of Rogel; and a maid-servant went and announced to them, and they will go, and announce to king David, for they will not be able to be seen to come to the city.[18]And a boy will see them and be will announce to Absalom; and they two will go quickly and will come to the house of a man in Bahurim, and to him a well In his enclosure; and they will go down there,[19]And the woman will take and spread the covering upon the mouth of the well and she will spread the medicine upon it; and the word will not be known.[20]And Absalom’s servants will come to the woman to her house, and they will say, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? and the woman will say to them, They passed over the brook of waters. And they will seek and not find; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.[21]And it will be after their going, and they will come up out of the well and will go and announce to king David, and they will say to David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the waters, for thus counseled Ahithophel against you.[22]And David will rise, and all the people which are with him, and they will pass over Jordan: till the light of the morning till not one was lacking which passed not over Jordan.[23]And Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not done, and he will saddle the ass and rise and go to his house to his city, and command his house, and he will strangle himself and die. And he will be buried in the grave of his father.[24]And David came to the camp. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.[25]And Absalom set Amasa instead of Joab over the army: and Amasa a man’s son, and his name Ithra, the Israelite, who went in to Abigail, daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab.[26]And Israel and Absalom will encamp in the land of Gilead.[27]And it will be as David went to Mahanaim, and Shobi, son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Ammiel of Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,[28]Beds and basins and vessels of earth, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched grain, and the bean and lentiles, and parched grain,[29]And honey and curdled milk, and sheep, and cheeses of kine, they brought near for David and for the people which Are with him, to eat; for they said the people are hungry and faint and thirsty in the desert.","2Sam.18":"[1]And David will review the people which are with him, and he will put over them captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds.[2]And David will send the people a third into the hand of Joab, and a third into the hand of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, and a third into the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king will say to the people, Going forth, I will go forth, also I, with you.[3]And the people will say, Thou shalt not go forth, for if fleeing, we shall flee, they will not set the heart to us; and if half of us shall die they will not set the heart to us: but now like us ten thousand: and now it is good that thou shalt be to us from the city for help.[4]And the king will say to them, What will be good in your eyes I will do. And the king will stand at the hand of the gate, and all the people will go forth, by hundreds and by thousands.[5]And the king will command Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Gently for me to the boy, to Absalom. And all the people heard in the king’s commanding all the chiefs for the word of Absalom.[6]And the people will go forth to the field to the meeting of Israel: and the war will be in the forest of Ephraim;[7]And there the people of Israel will be struck before David’s servants, and a great slaughter will be in that day of twenty thousand.[8]And there the battle will be scattered upon the face of all the earth: and the forest will multiply to consume of the people above what the sword will consume in that day.[9]And Absalom will meet before the servants of David, and Absalom rode upon the mule, and the mule will go under the thicket of the great oak, and his head will lay hold upon the oak, and he will be given between the heavens and between the earth; and the mule which was under him passed by.[10]And one man will see and announce to Joab, and say, Behold, I saw Absalom suspended in an oak.[11]And Joab will say to the man announcing to him, And behold, thou sawest, and wherefore didst thou not strike him there to the earth? and for me to give to thee ten of silver and one girdle.[12]And the man will say to Joab, And not I weighing upon my hand a thousand of silver, I will not stretch forth my hand against the king’s son, for in our ears, the king commanded thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Watch for me over the boy, over Absalom.[13]Or I did falsehood upon his soul; and any word will not be hid from the king, and thou wilt stand opposite.[14]And Joab will say, I will not delay before thee. And he will take three spears in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, he yet living in the heart of the oak.[15]And ten boys lifting up Joab’s arms will surround and strike Absalom, and kill him.[16]And Joab will strike upon the trumpet, and the people will turn back from pursuing after Israel: for Joab restrained the people.[17]And they will take Absalom and cast him in the forest into a great pit, and they will set upon him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled each to his tent.[18]And Absalom took and set up for him in his living, a pillar in the valley of the king; for he said, Not to me a son to call my name to mind: and he will call the pillar by his name, and he will call it The Hand of Absalom, even to this day.[19]And Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, said, I will run now and bring good news to the king that Jehovah judged him out of the hand of his enemies.[20]And Joab will say to him, Not thou a man of glad tidings this day, and another day thou shalt announce good news: and this day thou shalt not announce good news, because the king’s son died.[21]And Joab will say to Cushi, Go, announce to the king what thou sawest. And Cushi will worship to Joab, and run.[22]And Ahimaaz, son of Zadok will yet add, and say to Joab, What will be, I will run now, also I, after Cushi. And Joab will say, Wherefore this runnest thou my son, and goest, not finding good tidings?[23]And what will be, I will run. And he will say to him, Run. And Ahimaaz will run the way of the circuit, and pass by Cushi.[24]And David will sit between the two gates: and he watching will go to the roof of the gate to the wall, and he lift up his eyes and see, and behold, a man running by himself.[25]And the watcher will call and announce to the king. And the king will say, If alone, good news in his month. And he will go, going, and draw near.[26]And he watching will see another man running, and the watcher will call at the gate and say, Behold, a man running alone. And the king will say, This also announces good tidings.[27]And the watcher will say, I saw the running of the first as the running of Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son. And the king will say, A good man this, and he will come for good news.[28]And Ahimaaz will call and say to the king, Peace. And he will worship to the king upon the face to the earth, and he will say, Blessed Jehovah thy God who shut up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.[29]And the king will say, Peace to the boy, to Absalom? And Ahimaaz will say, I saw the great multitude at Joab’s sending the King’s servant, and thy servant; and I knew not what.[30]And the king will say, Turn, stand here. And he will turn and stand.[31]And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi will say, Good news will be announced, my lord the king, for Jehovah judged thee this day from the hand of all rising up against thee.[32]And the king will say to Cushi, Is peace to the boy, to Absalom? And Cushi will say, As the boy, shall all the enemies of my lord the king be, and all who rose up against thee for evil.[33]And the king will be moved, and he will go up into the upper chamber of the gate and weep: and thus he said in his going, My son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom I who will give my death, me for thee, Absalom my son, my son!","2Sam.19":"[1]And it will be announced to Joab, Behold, the king weeping, and he will mourn for Absalom.[2]And the salvation in that day will be turned to mourning to all the people: for the people heard in that day, saying the king was grieved for his son.[3]And the people will steal away in that day to go to the city, as people will steal away being ashamed in fleeing in battle.[4]And the king covered his face, and the king will cry out with a great voice, My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son![5]And Joab will come to the king, to the house, and say, Thou shamedst this day the faces of all thy servants saving thy soul this day, and the soul of thy sons and thy daughters, and the soul of thy wives, and the soul of thy concubines;[6]To love those hating thee, and hating those loving thee, for thou announcedst this day that not to the chiefs and servants: for I knew this day that if Absalom lived and all we this day died, that then it was straight in thine eyes.[7]And now arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants: for in Jehovah I swore if thou wilt not go forth, if a man shall lodge with thee this night: and this evil to thee above all the evil which came upon thee from thy youth till now.[8]And the king will rise and sit in the gate. And to all the people they announced, saying, Behold, the king sitting in the gate. And all the people will come before the king: and Israel fled a man to his tent.[9]And all the people will be judging in all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of the rovers and now he fled from the land from Absalom.[10]And Absalom whom we anointed over us died in war. And now, wherefore are ye silent to turn back the king?[11]And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak ye to the old men of Judah, saying, Wherefore will ye be the last to turn back the king to his house? And the word of all Israel came to the king to his house.[12]Ye my brethren; my bone and flesh are ye: and wherefore will ye be last to turn back the king?[13]And to Amasa ye shall say, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? thus will God do to me and thus will he add, if thou shalt not be chief of the army before me all the days, instead of Joab.[14]And he will incline the heart of all the men of Judah as one man; and they will send to the king, Turn back thou, and all thy servants.[15]And the king will turn back and come to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to cause the king to pass over Jordan.[16]And Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was from Bahurim, will hasten and come down with the man Judah to meet king David.[17]And a thousand men with him from Benjamin, and Ziba the boy of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.[18]The passing over passed over to cause the house of the king to pass over, and to do the good in his eyes. And Shimei son of Gera, fell before the king in his passing over Jordan.[19]And he will say to the king, My lord will not reckon iniquity to me, and he will not remember what thy servant did perversely in the day which my lord the king came forth from Jerusalem, for the king to set to his heart.[20]For thy servant knew that I sinned: and behold, I came this day the first for all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.[21]And Abishai son of Zeruiah, will say, For this shall not Shimei be put to death? for he cursed Jehovah’s Messiah.[22]And David will say, What to me, and to you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye shall be to me for an adversary? Shall there this day be a man put to death in Israel? Did I not know that this day I am king over Israel?[23]And the king will say to Shimei, Thou shalt not die: and the king will swear to him.[24]And Mephibosheth son of Saul, came down to the meeting of the king, and he did not his feet, and he did not his beard, and his garments he washed not from the day the king went till the day in which he came in peace.[25]And it will be when he came to Jerusalem to the meeting of the king, and the king will say to him, Wherefore wentest thou not with me, Mephibosheth?[26]And he will say, My lord the king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle for me the ass, and I will ride upon it, and I will go to the king; for thy servant is lame.[27]And he will slander against thy servant to my lord the king; and my lord the king as a messenger of God: and do thou the good in thine eyes.[28]For was not all my father’s house but men of death before my lord the king? and thou wilt set thy servant among those eating at thy table. And what is there to me yet of right and to cry yet to the king?[29]And the king will say to him, Wherefore wilt thou speak yet thy words? I said, Thou and Ziba shall divide the field.[30]And Mephibosheth will say to the king, Also he shall take all, after that my lord the king came in peace to his house.[31]And Barzillai the Gileadite will come down from Rogelim, and he will pass with the king over Jordan to send him upon Jordan.[32]And Barzillai a very old man, the son of eighty years: and he nourished the king in his dwelling in the two camps, for he was an exceeding great man.[33]And the king will say to Barzillai, Pass thou over with me, and I will nourish thee with me in Jerusalem.[34]And Barzillai will say to the king, According to what the days of the years of my life, that I shall go up with the king to Jerusalem?[35]The son of eighty years am I this day; shall I know between good to evil? if thy servant shall taste what I shall eat, and what I shall drink? if I shall yet hear to the voice of men singing or of women singing? and wherefore shall thy servant be yet for a burden to my lord the king?[36]As thy servant will pass a little over Jordan with the king; and wherefore shall the king recompense me this recompense?[37]Turn back now thy servant and I will die in my city, by the grave of my father and my mother: and behold, thy servant Chimham shall pass over with my lord the king; and do to him what is good in thine eyes.[38]And the king will say, With me shall Chimham pass over, and I will do to him the good in thine eyes; and all which thou shalt choose of me I will do to thee.[39]And all the people will pass over Jordan. And the king passed over, and the king will kiss to Barzillai, and bless him: and he will turn back to his place.[40]And the king will pass over to Gilgal, and Chimham passed over with him: and all the people of Judah will pass over with the king, and also half the people of Israel.[41]And behold, every man of Israel coming to the king, and they will say to the king, Wherefore did our brethren the men of Judah steal thee away, and they will cause the king to pass, and his house, over Jordan, and all David’s men with him?[42]And every man of Judah will answer to the man Israel, Because the king being near to me: and wherefore does this kindle to thee on account of this word? did we eat food from the king? or lifting up, did he lift up to us?[43]And the man Israel will answer the man Judah, and say, Ten hands to me in the king, and also in David I above thee: and wherefore didst thou make light of me? and was not my word first to me to turn back my king? And the word of the man Judah will will be hard above the word of the man Israel.","2Sam.20":"[1]And a man of Belial was met with there, and his name Sheba, son of Bichri, a man, a Jaminite: and he will strike upon the trumpet and say, No portion to us in David, and no inheritance to us in the son of Jesse: a man to his tent to Israel.[2]And every man of Israel will go up from after David, after Sheba, son of Bichri: and the men of Judah were joined to the king, from Jordan and even to Jerusalem.[3]And David will come to his house to Jerusalem; and the king will take the ten women, the concubines which he left to watch the house, and he will give them to the house of watch, and he will nourish them, and he went not in to them. And they will be bound together till the day of their death to live widows.[4]And the king will say to Amasa, Call together to me the men of Judah in three days, and stand thou here.[5]And Amasa will go to call Judah together: and he will delay from the appointment which he appointed him.[6]And David will say to Abishai, Now Sheba son of Bichri will do evil to us above Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants and go down after him, lest finding to himself fortified cities and he shadow our eyes.[7]And Joab’s men went forth after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and all the mighty went forth from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.[8]They by the great stone which is in the hill, and Amasa went before them.

And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba son of Bichri.[11]And a man from Joab’s boys stood by him, and he will say, Who delighted in Joab, and who that is for David, after Joab.[12]And Amasa rolling in blood in the midst of the highway. And the man will see that all the people stood, and he will turn Amasa from the highway to the field, and he will cast upon him a garment when he saw all coming by him and standing.[13]When he was taken away from the highway every man passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.[14]And he will pass through in all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to the house of oppression, and all the Berites: and they will be called together, and they will go also after him.[15]And they will come and besiege against him in Abel of the house of oppression, and they will pour out a mound against the city, and it will stand in the fortification: and all the people which were with Joab laying waste to throw down the wall.[16]And a wise woman will call out of the city, Hear ye, hear ye; say now to Joab, Come near hither and I will speak to you.[17]And he will draw near to her, and the woman will say, Art thou Joab? and he will say, I. And she will say to him, Hear the words of thy servant And he will say, I hear.[18]And she will say, saying, They will speak the word in the beginning, saying, They will ask an asking in Abel: and thus they finished.[19]I peaceful of the faithful of Israel: thou seeking to kill a city and a mother in Israel: wherefore wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?[20]And Joab will say, Far be it, far be it to me, if I shall swallow up and if I shall destroy.[21]Not thus the word; for a man from mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri, his name, lifted up his hand against the king, against David: ye shall give him only, and I will go from the city.

And the king will say, I will give.[7]And the king will spare upon Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, son of Saul, on account of the oath of Jehovah which was between them, between David and between Jonathan, son of Saul.[8]And the king will take the two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, which she bare to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Michal, Saul’s daughter, which she bare to Adriel, son of Barzillai the Meholathite:[9]And he will give them into the hand of the Gibeonites, and they will hang them in the mountain before Jehovah: and the seven will fall together, and they were put to death in the days of harvest in the first of the beginning of the harvest of barley.[10]And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah will take sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest till water was given upon them from the heavens, and she gave not the birds of the heavens to rest upon them in the day and the beast of the field at night.[11]And it will be announced to David what Rizpah the daugther of Aiah, concubine of Saul did.[12]And David will go and take the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan, his son, from the lords of Jabesh-Gilead, who stole them from the street of the House of Shan, where the rovers hung them there in the day the rovers struck Saul in Gilboa:[13]And he will bring up from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they will gather the bones of those being hung.[14]And they will bury the bones of Saul, and Jonathan his son, in the land of Benjamin in Zelzah in the grave of Kish his father: and they will do all which the king commanded. And God will hear for the land after this.[15]And yet there will be war to the rovers with Israel; and David will go down, and his servants with him, and they will fight with the rovers: and David will be faint.[16]And Ishbi-Benob who was from the children of Rephaim, and the weight of his spear three hundred weight of brass, and he being girded with a new one, and he will say to strike David.[17]And Abishai son of Zeruiah will help for him, and he will strike the rover and kill him. Then David’s men sware to him, saying, Thou shalt no more go forth with us to war, and thou shalt not quench the light of Israel.[18]And it will be after this, and there will be war yet in Gob with the rovers: then Sibbechai the Hushathite struck Saph who was of the children of Rephaim.[19]And there will be yet war in Gob with the rovers, and Elhanan, son of Jaare-Oregim of the House of Bread, will strike Goliah the Gathite, and the wood of his spear as the beam of those weaving.[20]And there will be yet war in Gath, and there will be a man of Midian, and the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet, six and six; twenty and four of number: and also he child to Rephah.[21]And he will reproach Israel, and Jonathan, son of Shimeab, David’s brother, will strike him.[22]Those four were born to Rephah in Oath, and they will fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.","2Sam.22":"[1]And David will speak to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul:[2]And he will say, Jehovah my rock and my fastness and my deliverer;[3]The God of my rock; I will trust in him: My shield and the horn of my salvation, my height and my refuge; My saviour; thou wilt save me from violence.[4]Praising, I will call Jehovah and shall be saved from mine enemies.[5]For the breakers of death surrounded me The torrents of Beilal will terrify me;[6]The pangs of hades surrounded me; The snares of death anticipated me;[7]In straits to me I will call Jehovah, And to God will I call, And he will hear my voice from his temple, And my cry in his ears.[8]And the earth will shake and tremble, The foundation of the heavens will be disturbed, And they will shake, for it kindled to him.[9]Smoke went up in his anger, And fire from his mouth shall consume: Coals were kindled from it.[10]He will incline the heavens and come down; And darkness under his feet.[11]And he will ride upon a cherub and fly: And he will be seen upon the wings of the wind.[12]And he will set darkness round about him for booths, The gatherings of waters the darkness of clouds.[13]From the shining before him were coals of fire kindled:[14]Jehovah will thunder from the heavens, And the Most High will give his voice.[15]He will send arrows and scatter them lightning, and put them in commotion.[16]The torrents of the sea will be seen, The foundations of the habitable globe will be uncovered, In the rebuke of Jehovah, from the breath of the spirit of his anger.[17]He will send from height, he will take me; He will draw me out of many waters:[18]He will deliver me from my strong enemy, From them hating me, for they were strong above me.[19]They will anticipate me in the day of misfortune, And Jehovah will be a support to me:[20]And he will bring me forth to a wide place; He will deliver me for he delighted in me.[21]Jehovah will recompense me according to my justice: According to the cleanness of my hands he turned back to me.[22]For I have watched the ways of Jehovah, And I acted not wickedly away from my God.[23]For all his judgments before me, And his laws I will not depart from them.[24]And I will be blameless to him, and I shall be washed from mine iniquity.[25]Jehovah will turn back to me according to my justice: According to my cleanness before his eyes.[26]With the merciful thou wilt be merciful, With the perfect man thou wilt be perfect.[27]With the chosen thou wilt be chosen, And with the perverse thou wilt be unseasoned.[28]And the people of affliction thou wilt save: And thine eyes upon the lifted up, thou wilt humble.[29]For thou my light, O Jehovah: And Jehovah will enlighten my darkness.[30]For in thee will I run, being pressed In my God will I leap over a wall.[31]The Strong One, blameless his way The saying of Jehovah purified, A shield to all trusting in him.[32]For who God besides Jehovah? And who a rock besides our God?[33]The Strong One strengthening me with strength: And he will leave his way blameless.[34]Setting my feet as the hinds: And upon the heights will he cause me to stand.[35]Teaching my hands to the war, And bringing down the brazen bow by mine arm.[36]And thou wilt give to me the shield of thy salvation, and thine answer will multiply me.[37]Thou wilt enlarge my steps under me, And my joints were not unsteady.[38]I will pursue mine enemies and destroy them I will not turn back even to finishing them.[39]And I will consume them and crush them, and they shall not be raised up.[40]Thou wilt fasten me together with strength for the war, Thou wilt subdue under me him rising up against me.[41]And the neck of mine enemies wilt thou give to me Those hating me, and I will cut them off.[42]They will look, and no saviour To Jehovah, and he answered them not.[43]And I will rub them as the dust of the earth: As the mire of the streets I will stamp them, I will beat them:[44]And thou wilt save me from the strifes of my people, Thou wilt watch me for the head of nations: The people I have not known shall serve me.[45]The sons of the stranger will lie to me: For the hearing of the ear they will hear to me.[46]The sons of the stranger shall fail, and be girded from their enclosings.[47]Jehovah living; and praised my rock: And God shall be lifted up, the rock of my salvation.[48]The Strong One giving vengeance to me, And bringing down peoples under me.[49]And bringing me out from mine enemies lifting me up from them rising up against me: From the man of violence thou wilt deliver me.[50]For this will I praise thee, O Jehovah, in the nations, to thy name will I play on the harp.[51]Magnifying the salvation of his king: And he has done mercy to his Messiah To David and to his seed even to forever.","2Sam.23":"[1]And these the last words of David. The declaration of David, son of Jesse, and the declaration of the man raised up for the Messiah of the God of Jacob, and the sweet songs of Israel.[2]The Spirit of Jehovah spake in me, and his word upon my tongue.[3]The God of Israel said to me, the Rock of Israel spake a parable upon the just man: a parable to fear God.[4]And as the light of the morning the sun will rise: the morning not dense; from the shining of the rain bringing forth herbage from the earth.[5]For not thus my house with the Strong One, for he set to me an eternal covenant, prepared in all, and watched: for all my salvation and delight will he not bring forth.[6]And Belial as the thorn thrusting out are all they, for they will not be taken by the hand.[7]And the man laboring in them shall be filled with iron and the wood of a spear; and in fire burning they shall burn in the dwelling.[8]These the names of the mighty, which were to David: the Tachmonite dwelling in the dwelling, head of the third; he Adino the Eznite: against eight hundred wounded at one time.[9]And after him Eleazar son of Dodo, son of Ahohi, among the three mighty with David in their upbraiding the rovers; they were gathered together there to war, and the men of Israel will go up.[10]He arose, and he will strike against the rovers till that his hand will be weary, and his hand will cleave to the sword: and Jehovah will do a great salvation in that day; and they sat down behind him only to strip off.[11]And after him, Shammah, son of Aga the Hararite. And the rovers will be gathered together to live; and there will be there a portion of the field full of lentiles: and the people fled from the face of the rovers.[12]And he will stand in the midst of the portion, and he will take it away, and he will strike the rovers: and Jehovah will do a great salvation.[13]And three of the thirty heads will go down and come to the harvest, to David, to the cave of Adullam: and the wild beasts, the rovers, encamped in the valley of Rephaim.[14]And David then in the fortress, and the station of the rovers then in the House of Bread.[15]And David will desire and say, Who will give me to drink waters from the well of the House of Bread, which is in the gate?[16]And the three mighty will break forth through the camp of the rovers, and draw waters from the well of the House of Bread, which is in the gate, and they will lift up and bring to David: and he would not drink them, and he will pour them out to Jehovah.[17]And he will say, Far be it to me, O Jehovah, my doing this the blood of the men going with their souls: and he would not drink them. These did the three mighty.[18]And Abishai Joab’s brother, son of Zeruiah, he the head of the three. And he raised up his spear against three hundred wounded, and to him a name among the three.[19]Above the three was he not honored? and he will be to them for chief: and he came not even to the three.[20]And Benaiah son of Jehoida, son of a living man great of works, from Kabzeel, he struck two lions of god of Moab: and he went down and struck a lion in the midst of a well in the day of snow.[21]And he struck a man, an Egyptian, who was seeing; and in the hand of the Egyptian a spear; and he went down to him with a rod, and he will pluck the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and kill him with his spear.[22]These did Benaiah son of Jehoida, and to him a name among the three mighty.[23]He was honored above the thirty, and to the three he came not.

And the messenger of Jehovah was near the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.[17]And David will say to Jehovah, in his seeing the messenger smiting the people, and he will say, Behold, I sinned and acted perversely; and these sheep, what did they? Now shall thy hand be upon me and upon my father’s house.[18]And Gad will come to David in that day and say to him, Go up, raise up an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.[19]And David will go up, according to the word of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.[20]And Araunah will look forth and see the king and his servants passing over to him: and Araunah will go forth and worship to the king, his face to the earth.[21]And Araunah will say, Wherefore came my lord the king to his servant? and David will say, To buy from thee the threshing-floor to build an altar to Jehovah, and the slaughter shall be withheld from above the people.[22]And Araunah will say to David, My lord the king shall take and bring up the good in his eyes: see, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-rollers, and the instruments of the oxen for wood.[23]And Araunah gave all to the king for the king. And Araunah will say to the king, Jehovah thy God will take pleasure in thee.[24]And the king will say to Araunah, Nay, but buying, I will buy of thee at a price; and I will not bring up to Jehovah my God a burnt-offering gratuitously. And David will buy the threshing-floor and the oxen for the silver of fifty shekels.[25]And David will build there an altar to Jehovah, and he will bring up burnt-offerings and peace.

for thou wilt teach them the good way which they shall go in it, and give rain upon thy land which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance.[37]If famine shall be in the land, if there shall be death, blasting, yellowness, the locust devouring; if his enemy shall press upon him in the land of his gates, every blow, every sickness;[38]Every prayer, every supplication which shall be to every man to all thy people Israel which shall know a man the blow to his heart and spread forth his hands to this house:[39]Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and forgive and do, and give to a man according to all his ways? for thou wilt know his heart; for thou wilt know alone the heart of all the sons of men:[40]So that they will fear thee all the days which they live upon the face of the earth which thou gavest to our fathers.[41]And also for the strangers which are not of thy people Israel, he shall come from a land afar off for sake of thy name;[42](For they will hear of thy great name and thy strong hand, and thy stretched out arm;) and coming and praying to this house;[43]Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and do according to all the stranger shall call upon thee?

And the king and all the sons of Israel will consecrate the house of Jehovah.[64]In that day the king consecrated the middle of the enclosure which was before the house of Jehovah: for he did there the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace: for the altar of brass which was before Jehovah was little for containing the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace.[65]And Solomon will make the festival in that day, and all Israel with him, a great convocation from the going in of Hamath even to the torrent of Egypt, before Jehovah our God seven days and seven days, fourteen days.[66]In the eighth day he sent away the people, and they will bless the king and go to their tents rejoicing and good of heart for all the good which Jehovah did for David his servant and for Israel his people.","1Kgs.9":"[1]And it will be when Solomon finished building the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and all the pleasure of Solomon which he desired to do,[2]And Jehovah will be seen to Solomon the second time as he was seen to him in the hill.[3]And Jehovah will say to him, I heard thy supplication and thy prayer which thou didst supplicate before me: I consecrated this house which thou didst build to put my name there even to forever; and mine eyes and my heart were there all the days.[4]And thou, if thou shalt go before me as David thy father went with integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I commanded thee, my law and my judgment thou shalt watch:[5]And I raised up the throne of thy kingdom over Israel forever, as spake to David thy father, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from the throne of Israel.[6]If turning back, ye shall turn back, ye and your sons from after me, and shall not watch my commands, my laws which I gave before you, and ye went and served other gods and worshiped to them:[7]And I cut off Israel from the face of the earth which I gave to them and the house which I consecrated to my name I will cast out from my face; and Israel was for a parable and for a derision among all peoples.[8]And this house shall be high, every one passing by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss: and they said, For what did Jehovah thus to this land and to this house?[9]And they said, Because they forsook Jehovah their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and they will lay hold upon other gods and worship to them, and serve them: for this, Jehovah brought, upon them all this evil.[10]And it will be from the end of twenty years, when Solomon built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the house of the king,[11](Hiram, king of Tyre, aided Solomon in woods of cedars and in woods of cypresses, and in gold to all his desire) then king Solomon will give Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.[12]And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon gave to him, and they were not right in his eyes.[13]And he will say, What these cities which thou gavest to me, my brother? And he will call them the land Cabul even to this day.[14]And Hiram will send to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.[15]And this the word of tribute which king Solomon brought up to build the house of Jehovah, and his house, and the fortress, and the walls of Jerusalem, and the enclosure, and Megiddo, and Gezer.[16]Pharaoh king of Egypt came up, and he will take Gezer and burn it in fire, and he killed the Canaanite dwelling in the city, and he will give it a sending to his daughter, Solomon’s.[17]And Solomon will build Gezer, and the house of the hollow below,[18]And Baalath and Tadmor in the desert, in the land.[19]And all the cities of stores which were to Solomon, and the cities of chariots, and the cities of horsemen, and the pleasure of Solomon which he pleased to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon; and in all the land of his ruling.[20]All the people remaining of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, which were not of the sons of Israel;[21]Their sons which were left after them in the land, which the sons of Israel will not be able to destroy them, and Solomon will bring them up for tribute of work even to this day.[22]And of the sons of Israel, Solomon gave not to serve, for they were men of war, and his servants and his chiefs, and his warriors, and chiefs of chariots, and his horsemen.[23]These the chiefs being stationed which were over the work to Solomon, fifty and five hundred going down among the people working in the work.[24]But Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the city of David to her house which he built for her: then he built the fortress.[25]And Solomon brought up three times in a year burnt-offerings and peace upon the altar which he built to Jehovah, and he burnt incense upon it that was before Jehovah: and he completed the house.[26]And Solomon made a ship in Ezion-Geber, which is with Eloth, upon the lip of the sea of sedge in the land of Edom.[27]And Hiram will send in the ships his servants, men of ships, knowing the sea with Solomon’s servants.[28]And they will come to Ophir, and take gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and bring to king Solomon.","1Kgs.10":"[1]And queen Sheba heard the report of Solomon for the name of Jehovah, and she will come to try him in enigmas.[2]And she will come to Jerusalem with very weighty strength, camels lifting up spices, and exceeding much gold and precious stone: and she will come to Solomon and will speak to him all which was in her heart.[3]And Solomon will announce to her all her words: there was not a word hid from the king which he announced not to her.[4]And queen Sheba will see all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house which he built,[5]And the food of his table, and the seats of his servants, and the standing of his attendants, and their vestments, and his cup-bearers, and his burnt-offerings which he will bring up to the house of Jehovah; and no more spirit was in her.[6]And she will say to the king, The word was truth which I heard in my land concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom.[7]And I believed not the words until I came, and mine eyes will see it: and behold, the half was not announced to me: thou didst add wisdom and good to the report which I heard.[8]Happy thy men, happy these thy servants, standing before thee continually, hearing thy wisdom.[9]Jehovah thy God will be blessed, who delighted in thee to give thee upon the throne of Israel: in Jehovah’s loving Israel forever, and he will set thee up for king to do judgment and justice.[10]And she will give to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices very many, and precious stone; there came no more as this spice for multitude which queen Sheba gave to king Solomon.[11]And also the ship of Hiram which lifted up gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir woods of almugs very many, and precious stone.[12]And the king will make of the almug trees a support for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, harps and lyres for songs; there came not such woods of almugs, and were not seen even to this day.[13]And king Solomon gave to queen Sheba all her desire which she asked, besides what he gave to her according to the hand of king Solomon.

And they will saddle him.[28]And he will go and find his corpse cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion ate not the carcass and brake not the ass.[29]And the prophet will lift up the corpse of the man of God and place it upon the ass, and he will turn him back: and the prophet, the old man, came to the city, and he will mourn and he will bury him.[30]And he will lay it down in his grave, and they will mourn over him, Alas, my brother![31]And it will be after they buried him, he will say to his sons, saying, In my dying and ye shall bury me in the grave which the man of God was buried in it; by his bones place my bones.[32]For being, the word shall be which he cried by the word of Jehovah upon the altar which is in the house of God, and upon all the houses of the heights which are in the cities of Shomeron.[33]After this word Jeroboam turned not back from his evil way, and he will turn back and make from the ends of the people, priests of the heights: him desiring he will fill his hand, and he will be priest of the heights.[34]And in this word it will be for sin to the house of Jeroboam, and to cut off and to destroy from the face of the earth.","1Kgs.14":"[1]In that time Abijah son of Jeroboam was sick.[2]And Jeroboam will say to his wife, Arise, now, and change thyself, and they will not know that thou art the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold there Ahijah the prophet; he spake concerning me for king over this people.[3]And take in thy hand ten of bread and crumb cakes, and a bottle of honey, and go to him: he will announce to thee what will be to the boy.[4]And Jeroboam’s wife will do so, and she will rise and go to Shiloh, and she will come into the house of Ahijah.

And he will come into the house of his God, and they coming forth from his bowels caused him to fall there by the sword.[22]And Jehovah will save Hezekiah, and those inhabiting Jerusalem, from the hand of Senherib king of Assur, and from the hand of all, and protect them from round about.[23]And many bringing a gift to Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah: and he will be lifted up to the eyes of all the nations from after this.[24]In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death, and he will pray to Jehovah: and he will say to him, and be gave to him a sign.[25]And not according to the doing to him did Hezekiah turn back, for his heart was lifted up: and there will be wrath upon him, and upon Judah and upon Jerusalem.[26]And Hezekiah will humble himself for the lifting up of his heart, he and those inhabiting Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.[27]And there will be to Hezekiah riches and honor exceedingly much: and he made to him treasuries for silver and for gold, and for precious stone, and for spices and for shields, and for all vessels of desire:[28]And stores for produce of grain and new wine, and new oil, and stalls for all cattle, and cattle and flocks for the stalls.[29]And he made cities to him and possession of flocks and oxen for abundance: for God gave to him exceeding much substance.[30]And this Hezekiah stopped the going forth of the waters of Gihon the highest, and he will make them straight down from the west to the city of David. And Hezekiah will prosper in all his work.[31]Thus in the chiefs of Babel interceding, sending to him to seek out the sign which was in the land, God left him, to try him, to know all in his heart.[32]And the rest of the words of Hezekiah and his mercies, behold them written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, son of Amos, upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.[33]And Hezekiah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the ascent of the graves of the sons of David: and all Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem did honor to him in his death: and Manasseh his son will reign in his stead.","2Chr.33":"[1]The son of twelve years was Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem.[2]And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as the abominations of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from before the sons of Israel.[3]And he will turn back and build the heights which Hezekiah his father pulled down; and he will raise up altars for the Baals, and he will make statues, and worship to all the army of the heavens, and he will serve them.[4]And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, which Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall be my name forever.[5]And he will build altars to all the army of the heavens in the two enclosures of the house of Jehovah.[6]And he caused his sons to pass through in fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: and he practiced magic and used divination, and offered prayers, and made sorcerers and wizards: he multiplied to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to irritate him.[7]And he will set up a carved image, the likeness which he made in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem which I chose from all the tribes of Israel, I will set my name forever.[8]And I will not add to remove the foot of Israel from the land which I set to your fathers; only if they will watch to do all I commanded them, for all the law and the precepts and the judgments by the hand of Moses.[9]And Manasseh will cause Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem to wander, to do evil more than the nations which Jehovah destroyed from before the sons of Israel.[10]And Jehovah will speak to Manasseh, and to his people, and they attended not.[11]And Jehovah will bring upon them the chiefs of the army which were to the king of Assur, and they will take Manasseh with hooks, and they will bind him with fetters and cause him to go to Babel.[12]And when straits were to him he besought the face of Jehovah his God, and he will humble himself greatly from before the God of his fathers.[13]And he will pray to him, and he will be entreated for him, and he will hear his supplication, and he will turn him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Jehovah he is God.[14]And after this he built a wall outside to the city of David from the west to Gihon, in the valley to the entering into the gate of fishes, and it turned round about to the hill, and he will lift it up greatly, and he will set chiefs of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.[15]And he will remove the strange gods and the likeness from the house of Jehovah, and all the altars which he built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and he will cast without to the city.[16]And he will build the altar of Jehovah, and he will sacrifice upon it sacrifices of peace and praise, and he will say to Judah serve Jehovah the God of Israel.[17]But the people yet are sacrificing in the height, only to Jehovah their God.[18]And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers speaking to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold them upon the words of the kings of Israel.[19]And his prayer, and he was entreated for him and all his sin, and his transgression, and the places where he built in them heights, and he set up statues and carved images before his humbling: behold them written upon the words of the seers.[20]And Manasseh will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in his house: and Amon his son will reign in his stead.[21]The son of twenty and two years was Amon in his reigning, and two years he reigned in Jerusalem.[22]And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah as did Manasseh his father: and to all the carved images which Manasseh his father made, Amon sacrificed, and he will serve them.[23]And he was not humbled from before Jehovah as Manasseh his father humbled himself; for this Amon multiplied trespass.[24]And his servants will conspire against him, and they will kill him in his house.[25]And the people of the land will strike all those conspiring against king Amon; and the people of the land will make Josiah his son king in his stead.","2Chr.34":"[1]The son of eight years was Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he reigned in Jerusalem.[2]And he did the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, and he went in the ways of David his father, and he turned not to the right and to the left.[3]And in the eighth year to his reigning, and he yet a youth, he began to seek to the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the heights, and the statues, and the carved images, and the molten images.[4]And they will pull down the altars of the Baals before him, and the images which were above from on high to them he cut down; and the statues and the carved images, and the molten images he break in pieces and beat small, and he will strew upon the face of the graves of those sacrificing to them.[5]And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and he will cleanse Judah and Jerusalem.[6]And in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim, and Simeon, and even to Naphtali he proved their houses round about.[7]And he will pull down the altars and the statues, and the carved images he beat down to make fine, and he cut down all the images in all the land of Israel, and he will turn back to Jerusalem.[8]And in the eighteenth year to his reigning, to cleanse the land and the house he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah chief of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz the rememberer to strengthen the house of Jehovah his God.[9]And they will come to Hilkiah the great priest, and they will give the silver being brought to the house of God, which the Levites watching the threshold gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.[10]And they will give to the hand of those appointed to do the work in the house of Jehovah, and they will give it to those doing the work, working in the house of Jehovah to repair and to strengthen the house.[11]And they will give to the artificers and to the builders to buy stones and woods for junctions, and to frame the houses which the kings of Judah destroyed.[12]And the men doing in the work in faithfulness: and over them being appointed Jahath and Obadiah the Levites from the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam from the sons of the Kohathites to superintend; and the Levites all understanding in instruments of song.[13]And over those carrying, and superintending to all doing the work for service and service: and from the Levites, scribes and leaders and gate-keepers.[14]And in their bringing forth the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah by the band of Moses.[15]And Hilkiah will answer and say to Shaphan the scribe, I found a book of the law in the house of Jehovah.

thou didst charge to them by the hand of Moses thy servant:[15]And bread from the heavens thou gavest to them for their hunger, and water from the rock thou broughtest forth to them for their thirst;

they wanted not; their garments fell not away, and their feet swelled not.[22]And thou wilt give to them kingdoms and nations, and thou wilt divide them to the extremity: and they will inherit the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.[23]And their sons thou didst multiply as the stars of the heavens, and thou wilt bring them to the land which thou saidst to their fathers to come in to possess.[24]And their sons will come in and possess the land, and thou wilt subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and thou wilt give them into their hand, and all their kings, and the nations of the land, to do them according to their will.[25]And they will take inaccessible cities, and a fat land, and they will inherit houses full of all good, and wells hewed out, vineyards and olive trees, and the tree of food for abundance: and they will eat and be filled, and be fat, and will live delicately in thy great goodness.[26]And they will be perverse, and they will rebel against thee, and they will cast thy law behind their back, and they killed thy prophets who testified against them to turn them back to thee, and they will make great reproaches.[27]And thou wilt give them into the hand of their adversaries, and they will press upon them: and in the time of their straits they will cry to thee, and thou wilt hear from the heavens; and according to thy many compassion thou wilt give to them saviours, and they will save them from the hand of their adversaries.[28]And when rest to them they will turn back to do evil before thee: and thou wilt leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they will come down upon them: and they will turn back and cry to thee, and thou from the heavens wilt hear, and wilt deliver them according to thy compassion, many times.[29]And thou wilt testify against them to turn them back to thy law: and they acted proudly and heard not to thy commands, and in thy judgments they sinned in them; (which a man shall do and he lived in them) and they will give a shoulder turning aside, and they hardened their neck and heard not.[30]And thou wilt protract over them many years, and thou wilt testify against them by thy spirit in the hand of thy prophets: and they gave not ear, and thou wilt give them into the hand of the people of the lands.[31]And in thy many compassions thou madest them not a finishing, and thou didst not forsake them; for thou a God merciful and compassionate.[32]And now our God, the great the mighty, and the terrible God, watching the covenant and the mercy, it shall not be little before thee all the distress which found us, to our kings, to our chiefs, to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers, and to all thy people from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day.[33]And thou art just for all brought upon us; for thou didst the truth and we were evil:[34]And our kings, our chiefs, our priests and our fathers, they did not thy law, and they attended not to thy commands and thy testimonies which thou didst testify against them.[35]And they in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness which thou gavest to them, and in the broad and fat land which thou gavest before them, served not thee, and turned not back from their evil works.[36]Behold, we this day are servants, and the land which thou gavest to our fathers to eat its fruit and its goodness, behold, we are servants upon it:[37]And its produce being much for the kings whom thou gavest over us in our sins: and ruling over our bodies and upon our cattle according to their will, and we in great straits.[38]And for all this we cut out faithfulness, and write;

In all this his anger was not turned back, and his hand was yet stretched out.[26]And he lifted up a signal to the nations from far off, and he hissed to them from the extremity of the earth; and behold, they shall come swift from haste.[27]None fainted, and none were weak among them; none shall slumber and none shall sleep; and the girdle of their loins was not loosed, and the thong of their shoes was not broken:[28]Whose arrows were sharpened, and all their bows bent, the hoofs of their horses were reckoned as the rock, and their wheels as the whirlwind.[29]The roaring to him as the lion, and he roared as the young lions: and they shall groan and shall lay hold of the prey, and it shall escape, and none delivering.[30]And they shall groan against them in that day as the groaning of the sea: and they looked to the land and, behold, straitened darkness, and the light darkened in its clouds.","Isa.6":"[1]In the year king Uzziah died, and I shall see Jehovah sitting upon his throne, high and lifted up, and his train filling the temple.[2]And seraphs standing from above to it; six wings, six wings to one; with two he will cover his face, and with two he will cover his feet, and with two he will fly.[3]And this called to this, and said, Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of armies: all the earth full of his glory.[4]The foundations of the thresholds will tremble from the voice calling, and the house will be filled with smoke.[5]And saying, Wo to me! for I was cut off; because I a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell: for mine eyes saw the king, Jehovah of armies.[6]And one from the seraphs will fly to me, and in his hand a hot stone, he took with the tongs from off the altar:[7]And he will touch upon my mouth, and say, Behold, this touched upon thy lips; and took away thine iniquity, and thy sin shall be covered.[8]And I shall hear the voice of Jehovah, saying, Whom shall I send, and who shall go for us? and behold me saying, Send me.[9]And he will say, Go, and say to this people, Hearing, hear ye, and ye shall not understand; and seeing, see ye, and ye shall not know.[10]Make the heart of this people fat and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes, lest they shall see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and their heart shall understand and turn back and be healed to them.[11]And saying, How long, O Lord? And he will say, Till when the cities were laid waste from not being inhabited, and the houses from not a man, and the land shall be laid waste with desolation.[12]And Jehovah put man far away, and much forsaking in the midst of the land.[13]And yet in it a tenth, and it turned back, and it was for consuming, as the terebinth and as the oak which in casting the trunk in them the holy seed its pillar.","Isa.7":"[1]And it will be in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Aram came up, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to war against her, and he was not able to fight against her.[2]And it will be announced to the house of David, saying, Aram rested upon Ephraim; and his heart will move to and fro and the heart of his people, as the woods of the forest moved from the face of the wind.[3]And Jehovah will say to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-Jashub thy son, at the extremity of the channel of the highest pool of the highway, of the fuller’s field;[4]And say to him, Watch and rest; thou shalt not fear, and thy heart shall not be tender from the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, upon the heat of anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.[5]Because Aram, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, will counsel evil against thee, saying,[6]We will go up against Judah and terrify her and subdue her for us, and we will make a king in the midst of her, the son of Tabeal:[7]Thus said the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, and it shall not be.[8]For the head of Aram, Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rezin, and in yet sixty and five years Ephraim shall be broken from a people.[9]And the head of Ephraim, Shomeron, and the head of Shomeron, the son of Remaliah.

is it small for you to weary men, but will ye weary God also.[14]For this, Jehovah he will give to you a sign Behold, the virgin conceiving, and she will bare a son, and call his name Immanuel.[15]Curdled milk and honey he shall eat, for his knowing to reject in evil, and to choose in good.[16]For before the boy shall know to reject in evil and to choose in good the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken from the face of its two kings.[17]Jehovah shall bring upon thee and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days which came not, from the day Ephraim turned away from Judah; the king of Assur.[18]And it was in that day Jehovah shall hiss for the fly which is in the extremity of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assur.[19]And they shall come and rest all of them in the valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all the thorn hedges, and in all pastures.[20]In that day shall Jehovah shave with a hired razor by those beyond the river, by the king of Assur, the head and the hair of the feet: and it also shall scrape off the beard.[21]And it was in, that day a man shall preserve alive a heifer of the herd, and two sheep.[22]And it was from the abundance of making milk he shall eat curdled milk; for curdled milk and honey shall eat all they being left in the midst of the land.[23]And it was in that day every place shall be where shall be there a thousand vines for a thousand of silver, for sharp points and thorns shall it be.[24]With arrows and with bows shall he come there: for sharp points and thorns shall be all the land.[25]And all the mountains which shall be dressed with the hoe, the fear of sharp points and thorns shall not come there: and it was for the sending forth of the ox and for the treading of sheep.","Isa.8":"[1]And Jehovah will say to me, Take to thee a great tablet, and write upon it with a man’s graving tool to hasten the spoil, urging on the plunder.[2]I will take to witness to me faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.[3]And I shall draw near to the prophetess;

I will rush upon her; I will set her on fire together.[5]Or he shall lay hold upon my strength, he shall make peace to me, he shall make peace to me.[6]Those coming of Jacob shall he cause to take root: Israel shall blossom and be fruitful, and they filled the face of the habitable globe with produce.[7]According to the blow of him striking him, he struck him; or according to the killing of those killing him, he killed.[8]In measure, in sending her forth thou wilt contend with her: he took away with a hard spirit in the day of the east,[9]Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob shall be expiated; and this all the fruit to remove his sin; in his setting all the stones of the altar as stones of lime broken in pieces, the statues and images shall not stand up.[10]For the fortified city was separated, the habitation being cast out and forsaken as the desert: there shall the calf feed, and there he shall lie down, and there he finished its branches.[11]In its harvest being dried up, women shall break it off in coming, illuminating it: for it is a people not understanding: for this he making them will not compassionate them, and he forming them will not have mercy upon them.[12]And it was in that day Jehovah will beat off from the stream of the river even to the torrent of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered together by one, one, ye sons of Israel.[13]And it was in that day he shall strike upon the great trumpet, and they perishing came into the land of Assui, and the outcasts into the land of Egypt, and they worshiped to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.","Isa.28":"[1]O to the crown of pride, wo to the hirelings of Ephraim! a flower falling away is the glory of his beauty which is upon the head of the valley of fatness of those smitten with wine.[2]Behold, a strong and active one to Jehovah, as a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, as a storm of vast waters overflowing, let fall to the earth with the hand.[3]With the feet shall the crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, be trodden down.[4]And the flower falling away was the glory of his beauty which is upon the head of the valley of fatness, as the first-fruits before fruit harvest which he looking at it shall see, in its continuing in his hand he will swallow it up.[5]In that day shall Jehovah of armies be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people.[6]And for a spirit of judgment to him sitting upon the judgment, and for strength of them turning back the battle of the storm.[7]And these also went astray by wine, and by strong drink they erred; the priest and the prophet went astray by strong drink, they were swallowed up from wine, they erred from strong drink, they went astray in seeing, they wavered in judgment.[8]For all tables were full of vomit, of filth without place.[9]Whom shall he teach knowledge? whom shall he cause to understand hearing? those weaned from milk and those taken away from the breasts.[10]For precept to precept, precept to precept; line to line, line to line; a little there, a little there:[11]For with the stammerings of the lip and with another tongue he will speak to this people.[12]To whom he said to them, This the rest they caused to the weary to rest; and this the quiet: and they would not hear.[13]And the word of Jehovah was to them, precept to precept, precept to precept; line to line, line to line; a little there, a little there, so that they shall go and they stumbled backward, and were broken and snared and taken.[14]For this, hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye men of scorn, ruling this people which is in Jerusalem.[15]Because ye said, We cut out a covenant with death, and with hades we did this; when this overflowing scourge passed through it shall not come to us, for we set falsehood our refuge, and in a lie we hid ourselves.[16]For this, thus said the Lord. Jehovah, Behold me placing for a foundation in Zion a stone, a stone of trial, a corner precious, a foundation being founded: and he believing shall not hasten.[17]And I set judgment to the line and justice to the weight: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of falsehood, and the waters shall overflow the covering.[18]And your covenant with death was obliterated, and your league with hades shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through and ye were for a treading down to it.[19]When passing through it shall take you: for by morning by morning it shall pass through in the day and in the night: and it was only an agitation to; understand the hearing.[20]For the spreading was shortened above stretching out, and the covering narrow for hiding one’s self.[21]For as mount Perazim shall Jehovah rise up, as the valley in Gibeon shall he be moved to do his work, his strange work, and to work his service, his unknown service.[22]And now ye shall not be mocker’s lest your bonds shall be strong: for I heard a completion and decision from the Lord. Jehovah of armies upon all the earth.[23]Give ear and hear my voice; tend and hear my saying.[24]Shall he ploughing, plough all the day to sow? shall he open and level his earth?[25]Did he not make level its face and disperse the fennel flower, and he will scatter the cummin, and he set the wheat in order, and designated the barley, and the spilt in his bound?[26]He will instruct him, according to judgment his God will teach him.[27]For the fennel flower shall not be beaten with the threshing sledge, and the wheel of a wagon shall not be turned about upon the cummin; for the fennel flower shall be beaten out with the rod and the cummin with the rod.[28]Bread shall be beaten small; for threshing, he will not forever thresh it; and the wheel of his wagon he put in motion and his horsemen shall not beat it small.[29]Also this shall come forth from Jehovah of armies, he being wonderful of counsel and great of understanding.","Isa.29":"[1]Wo to Ariel, Ariel, the city David encamped in! add ye year upon year;

and he awoke and his soul was empty: and as when the thirsty shall dream, and behold, he drank, and he awoke, and behold, he fainted, and his soul desired: thus shall be the multitude of all the nations warring against mount Zion.[9]Linger ye, and wonder; delight yourselves, and be ye blinded; they were drunken and not with wine; they reeled and not with strong drink.[10]For Jehovah poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and he will close your eyes: the prophets and your heads, the seeing he covered.[11]And the vision of all will be to you as the words of the book being sealed, which they shall give to him, to him knowing writing, saying, Read now, this: and he said, I shall not be able, for it was sealed.[12]And the book was given to him not knowing writing, saying, Read now, this: and he said, I know not writing.[13]And Jehovah will say, Because that this people drew near with their month, and honored me with their lips, and their heart was far from me, and their fear towards me shall be taught from the command of men.[14]For this, behold me adding to be wonderful with this people, dealing wonderfully and being a wonder: and the wisdom of their wise perished, and the understanding of their understanding ones shall be hid.[15]Wo to those making deep to hide counsel from Jehovah, and their work was in darkness, and they will say, Who saw us? and who knew us?[16]Shall not your perverting be reckoned as the potter’s clay? for shall the work say to him making it, He made me not? and he being formed, say to him forming, He understood not?[17]Is it not yet a very little and Lebanon turned back to Carmel, and Carmel shall be reckoned for a forest?[18]In that day the deaf heard the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of thick darkness, and darkness.[19]And the humble shall add joy in Jehovah, and the poor of men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.[20]For the terrible one ceased, the mocker was consumed, and they watching vanity were cut off:[21]Leading a man into sin by a word, and laying snares for him doing justice in the gate, and they will turn aside the just one by vanity.[22]For this, thus said Jehovah, to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham, Jacob shall not now be ashamed and his face shall not now become pale.[23]For in his seeing his children, the work of my hand, in his midst, they shall consecrate my name, and consecrate the Holy One of Jacob, and they shall fear the God of Israel.[24]And they going astray shall know understanding, and they murmuring shall learn knowledge.","Isa.30":"[1]Wo to sons turning aside, says Jehovah, to make counsel and not from me;

he will not spare: and there shall not be found in its crushing a sherd to take fire from the burning, and to skim off water from the reservoir.[15]For thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In turning back and in rest shall ye be saved; in quiet and in trust shall be your strength, and ye would not.[16]And ye will say, No; for upon horses we will flee: for this ye shall flee: and upon the swift will we ride; for this they pursuing you shall be swift.[17]One thousand from before the rebuke of one; from before the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye were left as a mast upon the head of the mountain, and as a signal upon the hill.[18]And for this Jehovah will wait to compassionate you, and for this he will be lifted up to pity you, for Jehovah is a God of judgment: happy all they waiting for him.[19]For the people shall dwell in Zion in Jerusalem: weeping, thou shalt not weep: pitying, he will pity thee at the voice of thy cry; for in his hearing, he answered thee.[20]And Jehovah gave to you the bread of straits and the waters of oppression, and he will no more cover those teaching thee, and thine eyes shall be seeing those teaching thee:[21]And thine ears shall hear the word from after thee, saying, This the way, go ye in it when ye shall turn to the right, and when ye shall turn to the left.[22]And defile ye the thin covering of the carved images of thy silver, and the overlaying of the molten things of thy gold: thou shalt scatter them as a menstruous cloth, thou shalt say to it, Go forth.[23]And he gave the rain of thy seed which thou shalt sow the earth and bread of the increase of the earth: and it was fat and fertile, thy cattle shall feed in that day in a large meadow.[24]And the oxen and the young asses working the land shall eat salted provender which was winnowed with the fan and by the winnower.[25]And there was upon every mountain being lofty and every hill lifted up, brooks and streams of water in the day of much slaughter, in the falling of the towers.[26]And the light of the moon was as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun, shall be seven fold, as the light of seven days, in the day Jehovah bound up the breaking of his people, and he will heal the wound of his smiting.[27]Behold, the name of Jehovah coming from far off, burning his wrath, and its lifting up heavy: his lips they were full of anger, and his tongue as consuming fire:[28]And his spirit as the torrent overflowing, shall divide even to the neck, to shake the nations in the sieve of ruin: and a curb upon the cheeks of the people, causing to err.[29]The song shall be to you as by night, consecrating a festival and gladness of heart, as he going with a pipe to come into the mountain of Jehovah to the rock of Israel.[30]And Jehovah caused the swelling of his voice to be heard, and he will cause the letting down of his arm to be seen in the anger of his wrath, and the flame of a consuming fire, violent rain and tempest, and the stone of hail,[31]For from the voice of Jehovah shall Assur be broken down, he will smite with a rod.[32]And it was every one passing by the rod of foundation which Jehovah shall cause to rest upon him, with drums and with harps: and in battles of moving to and fro shall he war with with it.[33]For tophet was set in order from yesterday; also it was prepared; for the king, he made deep, he made broad, its pile fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah as a torrent of pitch burned upon it.","Isa.31":"[1]Wo to those going down to Egypt for help;

will Jehovah say: If I cause to bring forth and did I shut up? said thy God.[10]Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad in her, all ye loving her: rejoice with her from joy, all ye mourning over her:[11]So that ye shall suck and be satisfied from the breast of her consolation; so that ye shall press out and be delighted from the brightness of her glory.[12]For thus said Jehovah, Behold me extending peace to her as a river, and as a torrent flowing to the glory of the nations: and ye sucked, ye shall be lifted upon the side, and ye shall be caressed Upon the knees.[13]As a man whom his mother shall comfort him, so will I comfort you; and in Jerusalem ye shall be comforted.[14]And ye saw, and your heart rejoiced, and your bones shall break forth as the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah was known with his servants, and his wrath to his enemies.[15]For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots as a whirlwind, to turn back in the wrath of his anger, and his rebuke in flames of fire.[16]For with fire and with sword Jehovah judged all flesh: and the wounded of Jehovah were many.[17]They consecrating themselves and cleansing themselves in the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse; together shall they perish, says Jehovah.[18]And I come to gather together all nations and tongues, their works and their purposes; and they came and saw my glory.[19]And I set a sign among them and I sent those escaping of them to the nations, Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing the bow, Tubal and Javan, the isles far off, that heard not my report, and saw not my glory; and they announced my glory among the nations.[20]And they brought all your brethren out of all the nations a gift to Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, said Jehovah, as the sons of Israel shall bring a gift in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.[21]And I also will take from them for priests, for Levites, said Jehovah.[22]For as the new heavens and the new earth which I made, standing before me, says Jehovah, so shall stand your seed and your name.[23]And it was as often as the new moon in its new moon, and as often as the Sabbath in its Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Jehovah.[24]And they went forth and saw the carcasses of the men transgressing against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they were an abhorrence to all flesh.","Jer.1":"[1]The words of Jeremiah son of Hillkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:[2]When the word of Jehovah was to him in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year to his reigning.[3]And it will be in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the fulness of the eleventh year to Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.[4]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[5]Before I shall form thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou shalt go forth from the womb I consecrated thee; I gave thee a prophet to the nations.[6]And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, behold I knew not to speak: for I a boy.[7]And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not say, I a boy; for thou shalt go to all to whom I shall send thee, and all which I shall command thee thou shalt speak.[8]Thou shalt not be afraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee, says Jehovah.[9]And Jehovah will stretch forth his hand and touch upon my mouth: and Jehovah will say to me, Behold, I gave my words into thy mouth.[10]See, I appointed thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms to pluck up and to tear down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant.[11]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying, What seem thou, Jeremiah? and saying, I see the shoot of an almond tree.[12]And Jehovah will say to me, Thou didst well to see; for I watch upon my word to do it.[13]And the word of Jehovah will be to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? and saying, I see a pot blown under, and its face from the face of the north.[14]And Jehovah will say to me, From the north shall evil be opened upon all the inhabitants of the earth.[15]For behold me calling to all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they came, and gave a man his throne at the opening of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all her walls round about and upon all the cities of Judah.[16]And I spake my judgment with them concerning all their evil, who forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods, and they will worship to the works of their hands.[17]And thou shalt gird thy loins and rise and speak to them all that I shall command thee: thou shalt not be terrified from their face lest I shall break thee before them.[18]Behold, I gave thee this day for a fortified city and for a pillar of iron and for a wall of brass upon all the land to the kings of Judah, to her chiefs, to her priests, and to the people of the land.[19]And they warred against thee; and they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, says Jehovah, to deliver thee.","Jer.2":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Go and call in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said Jehovah, I remembered for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy completion, thy going after me in the desert in a land not, sown.[3]Israel is holy to Jehovah, the beginning of the produce: all consuming him shall transgress; evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.[4]Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and the families of the house of Israel:[5]Thus said Jehovah, What iniquity found your fathers in me that they removed far off from me, and went after vanity, and they became vain?[6]And they said not, Where is Jehovah bringing us up out of the land of Egypt, causing us to go through the desert into a sterile land and a pit, through a land of drought and the shadow of death, through a land not a man passed through it, and not a man dwelt there?[7]And I will bring you to the land of Carmel, to eat its fruit and its goodness; and ye will come and defile my land, and ye set mine inheritance for an abomination.[8]The priests said not Where is Jehovah? and they holding the law knew me not: and the shepherds transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and they went After what will not profit.[9]For this I will even contend, with you, says Jehovah, and with your sons’ sons will I contend.[10]For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider greatly, and see whether there was like this.[11]Did a nation change their gods, and they no gods? and my people changed their glory for what will not profit.[12]Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and shudder; be ye greatly desolate, says Jehovah.[13]For my people did two evils: they forsook me the fountain of living waters, to hew out for them wells, broken wells which will not hold water.[14]Is Israel a servant? if he was born in the house wherefore was he for plunder?[15]Upon him the young lions roared, they gave their voice, they will set his land for a desolation: his cities were burned from not being inhabited.[16]Also the sons of Noph and Tahapanes, they will feed thee upon the crown of the head.[17]Wilt thou not do this to thyself? thou didst forsake Jehovah thy God in the time of thy being led in the way.[18]And now what to thee for the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Sihor? and what to thee to the way of Amur, to drink the water of the river?[19]Thy wickedness shall correct thee, and thy turnings back shall convict thee: and know thou and see that evil and bitter thy forsaking Jehovah thy God, and that my fear was not to thee, says the Lord Jehovah of armies.[20]For from of old I broke thy yoke, I burst thy bonds; and thou wilt say, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou turnest one side, committing fornication:[21]And I planted thee a vine of purple grapes, wholly a true seed: and how didst thou turn to me the removings of a strange vine?[22]For if thou shalt wash thyself with nitre, and thou shalt increase to thee cleansing, thine iniquity was graven before me, says the Lord Jehovah.[23]How wilt thou say, I was not defiled? I went not after the Baalims? See thy way in the valley, know what thou didst; a young she camel entangling her ways;[24]A wild ass accustomed to the desert in gratifying her soul, panting after the wind in her heat; who shall turn her back? all seeking her will not be wearied; in her new moon they shall find her.[25]Withhold thy foot from being barefoot, and thy throat from thirst: and thou wilt say, Despairing, no; for I loved strangers, and after them will I go.[26]As the shame of the thief when he shall be found, so was the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their chiefs, and their priests, and their prophets,[27]Saying to the wood, Thou my father; and to the stone, Thou didst bring me forth: for they turned to me the back of the neck and not their face: and in the time of their evil they will say, Arise, and save us.[28]And where thy gods which thou didst make to thee? they will arise, if they shall save thee in the time of thine evil: for from the numbering of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.[29]Wherefore will ye contend against me? all ye transgressed against me, says Jehovah.[30]In vain did I strike your sons; they received no instruction: your sword consumed the prophets as a lion destroying.[31]O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Was I the desert to Israel? If a land of thick darkness? wherefore said my people, We had dominion, we will come no more to thee?[32]Will a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her girdles? and my people forgat me days of no numbering.[33]How wilt thou make good thy way to seek love? for this also thou didst teach the evil ones thy ways.[34]Also in thy wings were found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: not by breaking in did I find them, but upon all these.[35]And thou wilt say, Because I was innocent his anger turned back from me. Behold me judging thee for thy saying, I sinned not.[36]Why wilt thou despise greatly to do the second time thy way? also thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt as thou wert ashamed of Assur.[37]Also from this thou wilt go forth and thy hands upon thy head: for Jehovah rejected thy trusts and thou shalt not give success to them.","Jer.3":"[1]Saying, If a man shall send away his wife, and she went from him and she was to another man, shall he yet turn back to her? Being defiled, shall not that land be defiled? and thou committedst fornication with many shepherds; and turn back to me, says Jehovah.[2]Lift up thine eyes upon the naked hills and see where thou wert not lain with. Upon the ways thou didst sit for them as the ravens in the desert; and thou wilt defile the land with thy fornications and with thine evil.[3]And the showers will be withheld, and the latter rain was not; and the forehead of a woman a harlot was to thee, and thou refusedst to be ashamed.[4]From the time didst thou not call to me, My father, thou the friend of my youth?[5]Will he guard forever? if he will watch to the end? Behold, I spake, and wilt thou do evil, and shalt thou be able?[6]And Jehovah will say to me in the days of Josiah the king, Sawest thou what Israel turning back, did? She went up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and she will commit fornication there.[7]And saying after she did all these, Thou shalt turn back to me. And she turned not back; and her faithless sister Judah will see it.[8]And I shall see for all the causes that Israel turning away committed adultery, I sent her away and I shall give a writing of her cutting off to her; and her faithless sister Judah was not afraid, and she will go and commit fornication, she also.[9]And it was her fornication being light, and she will defile the land, and she will commit adultery with stones and with woods.[10]And also in all this her faithless sister Judah turned not back to me with all the heart, but in falsehood, says Jehovah.[11]And Jehovah will say to me, Israel turning away justified her soul above faithless Judah.[12]Go and call these words to the north, and say, Turn back, O Israel, turning away, says Jehovah; I will not cause my face to fall upon you: for I am merciful, says Jehovah, I will not guard forever.[13]Only know thine iniquity that thou didst transgress against Jehovah thy God, and thou wilt scatter thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and to my voice ye heard not, says Jehovah.[14]Turn back, ye sons having turned away, says Jehovah; for I was lord over you: and I took you one from a city and two from a family, and I brought you to Zion.[15]And I gave to you shepherds according to my heart, and they fed you with knowledge and understanding.[16]And it was that ye shall be multiplied and be fruitful in the land in those days, says Jehovah; they shall no more say, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah: and it shall not come up upon the heart, and they shall not remember upon it, and they shall not review and it shall be clone no more.[17]In that time they shall call to Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all nations assembled together to her to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: and they shall no more go after the stubbornness of their evil heart.[18]In those days the house of Judah shall go with the house of Israel, and they shall go together out of the land of the north to a land which I caused your fathers to inherit.[19]And I said, How shall I place thee among the sons, and I will give to thee a land of desire, an inheritance of glory of the armies of nations? And saying, Ye shall call to me, My father; and ye shall rot turn back from after me.[20]Surely a wife acting faithlessly by her friend, so ye acted faithlessly against me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.[21]A voice was heard upon the naked hills, weepings, supplications of the sons of Israel: for they perverted their way, they forgot Jehovah their God.[22]Turn back, ye sons turning away; I will heal your turnings away. Behold, we came to thee; for thou Jehovah our God.[23]Truly in vain from the hills; the multitude of mountains; truly in Jehovah our God the salvation of Israel.[24]And shame consumed the labor of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their herd, their sons and their daughters.[25]We shall lie down in our shame, and our reproach will cover us: for we sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we heard not to the voice of Jehovah our God.","Jer.4":"[1]If thou wilt turn back, O Israel, says Jehovah; thou shalt turn back to me: and if thou wilt remove thine abominations from my face thou shalt not be moved.[2]And thou swearest, Jehovah lives in truth, in judgment, and in justice; and the nations were blessed in him, and in him shall they praise.[3]For thus said Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up to you the fallow ground, and ye shall not sow to thorns.[4]Be circumcised to Jehovah, and remove the uncircumcision of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath shall come forth as fire, and burn, and none quenching it from the face of the evil of your doings.[5]Announce ye in Judah, and cause to be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Strike the trumpet in the land: call, fill up, and say, Be ye gathered together and we will go to the fortified cities.[6]Lift up the signal of Zion: save ye by flight, ye shall not stand: for I bring evil from the north, and a great breaking.[7]The lion came up from his thicket, and destroying, he broke up the nations; he went forth from his place to set thy land for a desolation; thy cities shall be laid waste from none inhabiting.[8]For this, be ye girded with sackcloth, lament and wail: for the heat of the anger of Jehovah turned not back from us.[9]And it was in that day, says Jehovah, the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the chiefs; and the priests were astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.[10]And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely, deceiving, thou didst deceive to this people and to Jerusalem, saying, Peace shall be to you; and the sword reached even to the soul.[11]In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A clear wind of the naked hills in the desert the way of the daughter of my people, not for winnowing, and not for separating.[12]A spirit of fulness above these shall come to me: now will I also speak judgments to them.[13]Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots as the whirlwind: his horses were swift above eagles. Wo to us for we were laid waste.[14]O Jerusalem, wash from evil to thy heart so that thou shalt be saved. How long shall purposes of thy vanity lodge in the midst of thee?[15]For a voice announcing from Dan, and causing calamity to be heard from mount Ephraim.[16]Bring ye to remembrance to the nations; behold, cause to be heard against Jerusalem, watchers coming from a land afar off, and they shall give their voice against the cities of Judah.[17]As watching a field they were against her from round about; for she embittered against me, says Jehovah.[18]Thy way and thy doings did these things to thee; this thine evil, for it was bitter because it reached even to thy heart.[19]My bowels, my bowels! I shall afflict the walls of my heart; my heart made commotion to me; I shall not be silent, for the voice of the trumpet thou didst hear, O my soul, the tumult of war.[20]Breaking upon breaking was called; for all the land was laid waste: suddenly were my tents laid waste, my curtains in a moment.[21]How long shall I see the signal, shall I hear the voice of the trumpet?[22]For my people are foolish, they knew me not; foolish sons are they and they not understanding; wise are they to do evil, and to do good they knew not.[23]I saw the earth, and behold, emptiness and a void; and to the heavens, and no lights.[24]I saw the mountains, and behold them trembling, and all the hills were shaken.[25]I saw, and behold, no man, and all the birds of the heavens fled away.[26]I saw, and behold, Carmel a desert, and all its cities were broken down from the face of Jehovah, from the face of the heat of his anger.[27]For thus said Jehovah, All the earth shall be a desert; and I will not make a completion.[28]For this, shall the earth mourn, and the heavens became dark from above: because I spake, I purposed, I lamented not, and I will not turn back from it.[29]From the voice of the horseman and the throwing of the bowman all the city fled; they went into thickets, and they went up upon rocks: every city was forsaken, and not a man dwelling in them.[30]And thou being laid waste, what wilt thou do? If thou shalt put on scarlet, if thou shalt adorn thee with ornaments of gold, if thou shalt rend thine eyes with paint, in vain shalt thou beautify thyself: the lovers despised thee; they will Seek thy soul.[31]For I heard the voice as of her bringing forth, the anguish as of her bearing her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion, she will sigh, she will spread forth her hands, Wo now to me for my soul fainted for those slaying.","Jer.5":"[1]Run ye to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in her broad places, if ye shall find a man, if there is he doing judgment, seeking faithfulness; and I will pardon to her.[2]And if Jehovah lives, they will say, for this they will swear to a falsehood.[3]O Jehovah, are not thine eyes upon faithfulness? thou didst smite them, and they were not pained; thou didst consume them, they refused to take instruction: they made their faces firm above the rock; they refused to turn back.[4]And I said, Surely, they are weak; they became foolish: for they knew not the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God.[5]I will go for myself to the great ones, and I will speak to them; for they knew the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God: surely they together broke the yoke and tore away the bonds.[6]For this, a lion from the forest struck them, a wolf of the deserts will destroy them, the panther watched over their cities: every one going forth from thence shall be torn in pieces; for their transgressions were multiplied, their turnings away were strong.[7]How shall I forgive to thee for this? thy sons forsook me, and they will swear by not God; and I will satisfy them, and they will commit adultery, and they will crowd themselves together to the house of the harlot.[8]They were horses seducing to fornication: roaming about, they will neigh, a man for the wife of his neighbor.[9]For these shall I not review?

and thou saidst to them, As ye forsook me, and ye will serve a strange god in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land not to you.[20]Announce ye this in the house of Jacob, and cause it to be heard in Judah, saying,[21]Hear now this, O foolish people, and no heart; eyes to them and they will not see; and ears to them, and they will not hear:[22]Will ye not fear me? says Jehovah; or will ye not tremble from my face, who set the sand a bound to the sea a law forever, and it shall not pass over it: and its waves shall toss themselves and shall not prevail; and they were put in commotion and shall not pass over it.[23]And to this people was a heart turning aside and perverse, and they turned aside and departed.[24]And they said not in their heart, Now will we fear Jehovah our God, giving rain, and the early and latter rain in its time: the appointed sevenths of harvest he will watch for us.[25]Your iniquities turned away these things, and your sins withheld the good from you.[26]For evil ones were found among my people: he will look about as the stooping of fowlers; they set snares, they will take men.[27]As a cane full of birds, so their houses full of deceit: for this they were magnified and they will be rich.[28]They became fat, they shone: they passed over words of evil: they judged not judgment, the judgment of the orphan, and they will give success; and the judgment of the needy they judged not.[29]For these things shall I not review? says Jehovah: or shall not my soul be avenged upon a nation such as this?[30]Astonishment and horror was in the land.[31]The prophets prophesied in falsehood, and the priests will spread out with their hands; and my people loved it thus: and what will ye do to its last part.","Jer.6":"[1]Be strong, ye sons of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem, and in Tekoa strike the trumpet, and lift up a lifting up upon the house of the vineyard, for evil overhung from the north, and great breaking.[2]I likened the daughter of Zion to her becoming and delicate.[3]To her shall come the shepherds and their flocks; they fixed the tents upon her round about; they fed each with his hand.[4]Consecrate ye war against her; arise, and we will go up at noon. Wo to us! for the day turned away, for the shadows of the evening will stretch forth.[5]Arise, and we will go up in the night, and we will destroy her fortresses.[6]For thus said Jehovah of armies, Cut off the wood, and throw up a mound against Jerusalem: this the city to be reviewed; oppression is wholly in her midst.[7]As a pit, letting flow her waters, so she dug up her evil: violence and oppression will be heard in her; upon my face continually disease and smiting.[8]Be admonished, O Jerusalem, lest thy soul shall be alienated from thee; lest I shall set thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.[9]Thus said Jehovah of armies, Gleaning, they shall glean as a vine the remainder of Israel: turn back thy hand as he gathering grapes into wicker baskets.[10]To whom shall I speak and testify, and they will hear? behold, their ear being uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah was to them for a reproach; they will not delight in it.[11]I was filled with the wrath of Jehovah; I was weary holding up; to pour out upon the child in the street and upon the assembly of the young men together; for also the man with the woman shall be taken, the old man with the full of days.[12]And their houses were turned to others, the fields and women together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah.[13]For from their little even to their great, every one plundering, plundered; and from the prophet and even to the priest every one did falsehood.[14]And they will heal the breaking of the daughter of my people by making light, and saying, Peace, peace; and no peace.[15]Were they ashamed when they did abomination? also shaming they will not be ashamed; also they knew not feeling shame; for this they shall fall with those falling: in the time of my reviewing them they shall faint, said Jehovah.[16]Thus said Jehovah, Stand ye upon the ways, and see, and ask for the beaten paths of old, where this the good way, and go ye in it, and find rest to your soul. And they will say, We will not go.[17]And I set up watchers over you, Attend ye to the voice of the trumpet And they will say, We will not attend.[18]For this, hear ye nations, and know, O Assembly, what is among them.[19]Hear, thou earth: Behold me bringing evil to this people, the fruit of their purposes, for to my word they hearkened not, and my law they will reject it.[20]Wherefore this to me shall frankincense come from Sheba, and the good cane from a land from far off? your burnt-offerings are not for acceptance, and your sacrifices were not sweet to me.[21]For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving to this people stumbling blocks, and they stumbled upon them, the fathers and sons together; the inhabitant and his neighbor shall perish[22]Thus said Jehovah, Behold, a people coming from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.[23]They shall lay hold of bow and javelin; it is fierce and they will not pity; their voice will roar as the sea, and they will ride upon horses arranged as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.[24]We heard its report: our hands were relaxed; straits held us, pain as of her bringing forth[25]Thou shalt not go forth to the field, and thou shalt not go by the way; for the sword to the enemy, fear from round about.[26]O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, and roll thyself in ashes: make to thee the mourning of an only begotten, a wailing of bitterness; for he laying waste shall suddenly come upon us.[27]I gave thee a watch-tower among my people, a fortification, and thou shalt know and try their way.[28]They are all turning aside, degenerate shoots, going about tale-bearing: brass and iron, they are destroyers all of them.[29]The bellows were burnt from their fire, the founder melted the lead in vain, and the evil were not plucked up.[30]They called to them, Rejected silver, because Jehovah rejected them.","Jer.7":"[1]The word that was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,[2]Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and call there this word, and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah coming into these gates to worship to Jehovah.[3]Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Make good your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.[4]Ye shall not trust to yourselves to words of falsehood, saving, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah are they.[5]For if making good, ye shall make good your ways and your doings; if doing, ye shall do judgment between man and between his neighbor;[6]Ye shall not oppress the stranger, the orphan and the widow, and innocent blood ye shall not pour out in this place, and after other gods ye shall not go, for evil to you;[7]And I caused you to dwell in this place, in the land which I gave to your fathers from forever even to forever.[8]Behold, you trusting to yourselves upon words of falsehood not to receive profit.[9]Stealing, killing, and committing adultery, and swearing for falsehood, and burning incense to Baal, and going after other gods which ye knew not;[10]And ye came and stood before me in this house which my name was called upon it, and ye said, We were delivered to do all these abominations.[11]Was this house which my name was called upon it a cave of those breaking down in your eyes? also I, behold, I saw, says Jehovah.[12]But go now to my place which is in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell there at the first, and see what I did to it from the face of the evil of my people Israel.[13]And now, because ye did all these works, says Jehovah, and I will speak to you, rising early and speaking, and ye heard not; and I will call you and ye answered not;[14]And I did to the house which my name was called upon it, which ye are trusting in it, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.[15]And I cast you out from my face, as I cast out all your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.[16]And thou shalt not pray for this people, and thou shalt not lift up a wailing and prayer for them, and thou shalt not entreat upon me: for I hear thee not.[17]Seest thou not what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?[18]The sons are gathering up woods, and the fathers kindling the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to other gods, to irritate me.[19]Are they irritating me? says Jehovah. Are they not themselves to the shame of their faces?[20]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah; Behold my anger and my wrath was poured out to this place, upon man, and upon cattle, and upon the tree of the field, and upon the fruit of the land; and it burnt and it shall not be quenched.[21]Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel; Add your burnt-offerings upon your sacrifices and eat flesh.[22]For I spake not to your fathers, and I commanded them not in the day of bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, concerning my word of burnt-offering and sacrifice:[23]But this word I commanded them, saying, Hear to my voice, and I was to you for God, and in shall be to me for a people: and go in all the ways which I shall command you, so that it shall be well to you.[24]And they heard not and inclined not their ear, and they went in the counsels in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and they shall be for behind and not before.[25]From the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt even to this day, and I will send to you all my servants the prophets, in the day rising early and sending:[26]And they heard not to me and they inclined not their ear, and they will harden their neck: they did evil above their fathers.[27]And speak thou to them all these words, and they will not hear to thee: and call to them, and they will not answer.[28]And say to them, This a nation that heard not to the voice of Jehovah its God, and they received not instruction: faithfulness perished, and was eat off from their mouth.[29]Shave thy consecration and cast away, and lift up a lamentation upon the lips; for Jehovah rejected and cast out the generation of his wrath.[30]For the sons of Judah did evil in mine eyes, says Jehovah; they set, their abominations in the house which my name was called upon it, to defile it,[31]And they built heights to Tophet which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in fire; which I commanded not, and it came not upon my heart.[32]For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and it shall no more be said, Tophet, and The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: and they buried in Tophet, from not being place.[33]And the carcass of this people was for food to the birds of the heavens and for the cattle of the earth; and none terrifying.[34]And I caused to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be for a desolation.","Jer.8":"[1]In that time, says Jehovah, and they shall bring forth the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his chiefs, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:[2]And they spread them to the sun and to the moon, and to all the army of the heavens which they loved, and which they served, and which they, went after, and which they sought and which they worshiped to them: they shall not be gathered and they shall not be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.[3]And death was chosen above life to all the remnant of those being left from this evil family, in all the places being left where I cast them out there, says Jehovah of armies.[4]And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Shall they fall and not rise? if he shall turn back, and not turn back?[5]Wherefore did this people of Jerusalem turn away a continual turning away? they laid hold upon deceit; they refused to turn back.[6]I hearkened and I will hear, they shall not speak thus: no man lamented for his evil, saying, What did I? Every one turned back in his race as the horse rushing into battle.[7]Also the stork in the heavens knew her appointment; and the turtle-dove, and the swallow, and the twitterer watched the time of their coming; and my people knew not the judgment of Jehovah.[8]How shall ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah with us? Behold, surely for falsehood he made the style of the scribes a lie.[9]The wise were ashamed, they were confounded, and they will be taken: behold, they rejected in the word of Jehovah; and what wisdom to them?[10]For this I will give their wives to others; their fields to those inheriting them: for from small and even to great all plundering a plunder, from the prophet and even to the priest, all did falsehood.[11]And they will heal the breaking of the daughter of my people by making light of, saying, Peace, peace; and no peace.[12]Were they ashamed when they did abomination? also shaming they will not be ashamed, and they knew not to feel shame: for this they shall fall among the falling: in the time of their reviewing they shall faint, said Jehovah.[13]Destroying, I will destroy them, says Jehovah; no grapes upon the vine, and no figs upon the fig tree, and the leaf fell away; and what I shall give to them shall pass by them.[14]For what are we sitting? gather ye together and we will go into the fortified cities, and we shall be silent there: for Jehovah our God caused us to cease, and he will give us to drink the water of poison, for we sinned against Jehovah.[15]Hoping for peace, and no good; for a time of healing, and behold, terror.[16]From Dan was heard the snorting of his horses; from the voice of the neighings of his strong ones all the land trembled: and they will come and cut up the land, and its fulness; the city and those dwelling in it.[17]For behold me sending serpents, vipers among you, which to them no hissing, and they bit you, says Jehovah.[18]Because I afflicted not sorrow upon myself, my heart was sick upon me.[19]Behold the voice of the cry for help of the daughter of my people from the land of those being far off: is not Jehovah in Zion? or her king not in her? wherefore did they irritate me with their carved images, with strange vanities?[20]The harvest passed by, the summer was completed, and we were not saved.[21]For the breaking of the daughter of my people was I broken; I was darkened; astonishment took hold of me.[22]Is there no balsam in Gilead, or healing there? for wherefore did not the health of the daughter of my people go up?","Jer.9":"[1]Who will give my head waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears? and I will weep day and night for the wounded of the daughter of my people.[2]Who will give me in the desert a lodging-place of travelers? and I will leave my people and go from them, for they all commit adultery; an assembly of those acting faithlessly.[3]And they will bend their tongue, their bow, a lie: and they were not strong for faithfulness upon the land; for from evil to evil they went forth, and they knew me not, says Jehovah.[4]Watch ye each from his neighbor, and to any brother ye shall not trust, for every brother deceiving, will deceive, and every neighbor will go tale-bearing.[5]And they will mock, a man upon his neighbor, and they will not speak the truth: they taught their tongue to speak falsehood, they wearied themselves to sin.[6]Thy dwelling is in the midst of deceit; by deceit they refused to know me, says Jehovah.[7]For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me melting them, and I tried them; for how shall I do for the face of the daughter of my people?[8]Their tongue a deadly arrow, speaking deceit; in his mouth he will speak peace to his neighbor, and be will lay his wait in his midst.[9]For these things, shall I not review upon them? says Jehovah; or shall not my soul be avenged upon a nation such as this?[10]For the mountains I will lift up weeping and lamentation, and for the seats of the desert, a song of mourning, for they were burnt, from not a man passing through; and they heard not the voice of cattle: from the bird of the heavens and even to the cattle, they fled away, they departed.[11]And I gave Jerusalem for heaps and a dwelling of jackals; and the cities of Judah I will give a desolation from none inhabiting.[12]Who the wise man and he will understand this? and which the mouth of Jehovah spake to him, and he will announce it, for what the land perished it was burnt as the desert, from not being passed through.[13]And Jehovah will say, For their forsaking my law which I gave before their face, and they heard not to my voice, and they went not in it.[14]And they went after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baalims which their fathers taught them.[15]For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Behold me causing this people to eat wormwood, and I gave them to drink water of poison.[16]And I scattered them in the nations which they knew not, they and their fathers: and I sent after them the sword till I consumed them.[17]Thus said Jehovah of armies, Give heed, and call ye for the wailing women, and they shall come forth; and send ye to the wise women, and they shall come forth.[18]And they shall hasten and lift up a lamentation for us, and our eyes shall go down with tears, and our eyelashes shall shake out waters.[19]For a voice of lamentation was heard from Zion: How were we laid waste! we were greatly ashamed, for we forsook the land, and cast away our dwellings.[20]For hear, ye women, the word of Jehovah, and your ear shall receive the word of his mouth, and teach ye your daughters lamentation, and a woman her neighbor, the song of mourning.[21]For death came up into our windows, it came into our palaces to cut off the child from without, the young men from the streets.[22]Speak: Thus says Jehovah, The carcasses of men fell as dung upon the face of the field, as the handful after the reaper, and none gathering.[23]Thus said Jehovah, The wise shall not boast in his wisdom, and the strong shall not boast in his strength; the rich shall not boast in his riches:[24]But he boasting shall boast in this, to understand and know me, that I am Jehovah, doing mercy, judgment and justice in the earth: for in these I delighted, says Jehovah.[25]Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I reviewed over all the circumcised with the uncircumcised;[26]Over Egypt and over Judah and over Edom, and over the sons of Ammon, and over Moab, and over all cut off of the extremity dwelling in the desert: for all the nations being uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel uncircumcised of heart.","Jer.10":"[1]Hear ye the word which Jehovah spake to you, O house of Israel:[2]Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not learn according to the way of the nations, and from the signs of the heavens ye shall not be terrified; for the nations will be terrified from them.[3]For the laws of the peoples, this vanity: for they cut down a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.[4]With gold and with silver they will beautify; with nails and with hammers they will make firm and it will not move.[5]They are of turned work, as the palm tree, and they shall not speak; being lifted up they shall be lifted up, for they shall not mount up. Ye shall not be afraid of them, for they will not do evil, and also doing good is not with them.[6]For none like thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and great thy name in strength.[7]Who shall not fear thee, thou king of the nations? for to thee he shall come: for among all the wise of the nations, and among all their kings, from none like thee.[8]And in one they will become brutish, and they will be foolish: the tree itself a correction of vanities.[9]Silver beaten out shall be brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and the hands of the founder: cerulean purple and red purple their clothing: they all are the work of the wise.[10]And Jehovah the God of truth; he the living God, and king eternal: from his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not prevail over his anger.[11]Thus shall ye say to them, The gods who made not the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.[12]He made the earth in his power, setting upright the habitable globe by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens.[13]At the voice his giving a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he will bring the lifting up from the end of the earth; he made lightnings to the rain, and he will bring forth the wind from his treasures.[14]Every man was brutish from knowledge: every founder was ashamed from his carved image; for his molten image a falsehood, and no spirit in them.[15]They are vanity, the work of delusions: in the time of their reviewing they shall perish.[16]The portion of Jacob not as these: for he forming all things, and Israel the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of armies his name.[17]Gather the bundles out of the land, thou dwelling in the fortress.[18]For thus said Jehovah: Behold me slinging out those inhabiting the land at this once, and I pressed upon them so that they shall find.[19]Wo to me for my breaking! my blow was sickly; and I said, Surely this a sickness, and I will bear it.[20]My tent was laid waste, and all my cords were broken: my sons went forth from me, and they are not: none stretched forth my tent any more, and the place of my curtains.[21]For the shepherds were brutish, and they sought not Jehovah: for this they considered not, and all their flock was scattered.[22]Behold, a voice of tidings coming, and a great shaking from the land of the north, to set the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling of jackals.[23]I knew, O Jehovah, that not to man his way; not to man to go and set right his step.[24]Correct me, O Jehovah, but in judgment, not in thy wrath, lest thou shalt make me small.[25]Pour out thy wrath upon the nations which knew thee not, and upon the families that called not upon thy name: for they ate up Jacob and consumed him, and they will finish him, and they made desolate his dwelling.","Jer.11":"[1]The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,[2]Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem:[3]And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: Cursed the man who will not hear the words of this covenant,[4]Which I commanded your fathers in the day of my bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the furnace of iron, saying, Hear ye to my voice, and do them according to all that I shall command you: and be to me for a people, and I will be to you for God:[5]To establish the oath which I sware to your fathers, to give to them a land flowing milk and honey, as this day. And I shall answer and say, Verily, O Jehovah.[6]And Jehovah will say to me, Call all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.[7]For testifying, I testified to your fathers in the day of my bringing them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and testifying, saying, Hear ye to my voice.[8]And they heard not, and inclined not their ear, and they went a man in the stubbornness of their evil heart: and I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which I commanded to do; and they did not.[9]And Jehovah will say to me, A conspiracy was found in the men of Judah, and in the inhabitants of Jerusalem.[10]They turned back to the iniquities of their fathers before them who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah brake my covenant which I cut out with their fathers.[11]For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil to them which they shall not be able to go forth from it; and they cried to me and I will not hear to them.[12]And the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went and cried to the gods which they burnt incense to them: and saving, they will not save to them in the time of their evil.[13]For from the numbering of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and from the numbering of the streets of Jerusalem, ye set up altars to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal.[14]And thou shalt not pray for this people, and thou shalt not lift up for them an outcry and a prayer: for I hear not in the time of their calling to me for their evil.[15]What is to my beloved in my house making mischief to many, and they shall cause the holy flesh to pass away from thee? for thou didst evil, then wilt thou exult.[16]A green olive tree, fair, of fruit of figure, Jehovah called thy name; by the voice of a great noise he kindled a fire upon her, and its branches were evil.[17]And Jehovah of armies planting thee, spake evil against thee, on account of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah which they did to themselves to irritate me, burning incense to Baal.[18]And Jehovah made known to me and I shall know: then thou caused me to see their doings.[19]And I as a gentle lamb being brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that against me they purposed purposes: We will destroy the tree with its food, and we will cut him off from the land of the living, and his name shall no more be remembered.[20]O Jehovah of armies, judging justice and trying the reins and the heart, I shall see thy vengeance from them, for to thee I uncovered my cause.[21]For this, thus said Jehovah, concerning the men of Anathoth seeking my soul, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, and thou shalt not die by our hand.[22]For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me reviewing over them: their young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:[23]And a remnant shall not be to them: for I will bring evil to the men of Anathoth, the year of their reviewing.","Jer.12":"[1]Just art thou, O Jehovah, for I will strive to thee: surely I will speak judgments with thee: Wherefore did the way of the evil prosper? all they acting faithlessly with treachery were secure?[2]Thou didst plant them; they took root; they went on, also they made fruit: thou being near in their mouth, and far off from their reins.[3]And thou, Jehovah, knew me: thou wilt see me, and thou didst try my heart with thee: pluck them out as sheep for the slaughter, and consecrate them to the day of slaughter.[4]How long shall the land mourn, and the herbage of every field dry up from the evil of those dwelling in it the earth perished, and the birds; for they said, He shall not see our last Part.[5]If thou didst run with the footmen and they will weary thee, and how wilt thou contend with horses? and in the land of peace thou trustest, and how wilt thou do in the grandeur of Jordan.[6]For also thy brethren and the house of thy father, they also acted faithlessly with thee; they also called after thee a fulness: thou shalt not believe in them for they will speak to thee good things.[7]I forsook my house, I rejected mine inheritance; I gave the beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.[8]My inheritance was to me as a lion in the forest; she gave upon me with her voice: for this I hated her.[9]The ravenous hyena is my inheritance to me, rushing round about upon her; go ye, gather together all the beasts of the field, set ye upon to eat her.[10]Many shepherds destroyed my vineyard, they trod down my portion, they gave the portion of my desire for a desert of desolation.[11]Setting her for a desolation, she mourned to me; all the land was set a desolation, for no man put upon his heart.[12]They spoiling came upon all the hills of the desert: for the sword of Jehovah consumed from the extremity of the land even to extremity of the land: no peace to all flesh.[13]They sowed wheat and they reaped thorns: they were wearied, they shall not profit; and they were ashamed of your gains from the burning of the anger of Jehovah.[14]Thus said Jehovah concerning all my evil neighbors, those touching upon the inheritance which I caused my people Israel to inherit: behold me tearing them up from their land, and I will tear up the house of Judah from the midst of them.[15]And it was after my tearing them up I will turn back and compassionate them, and cause them to dwell a man to his inheritance, and a man to his land.[16]And it was if learning, they shall learn the ways of my people to swear in my name, Jehovah lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; and they were built up in the midst of my people.[17]And if they will not hear, tearing up and destroying, I tore up that nation, says Jehovah.","Jer.13":"[1]Thus said Jehovah to me, Go buy for thee a girdle of linen, and put it upon thy loins, and thou shalt not cause it to come into water.[2]And I shall buy the girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and I shall put upon my loins.[3]And the word of Jehovah will be to me the second time, saying,[4]Take the girdle that thou boughtest, which is upon thy loins, and arising, go to Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock.[5]And I shall go and hide it by Euphrates as Jehovah commanded me.[6]And it will be from the end of many days, and Jehovah will say to me, Rising, go to Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle which I commanded thee to hide it there.[7]And I shall go to Euphrates, and dig, and take the girdle from the place which I hid it there: and behold, the girdle was corrupted, it will not profit for anything.[8]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[9]Thus said Jehovah, According to this I will corrupt the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.[10]This evil people, refusing to hear my words, going in the stubbornness of their heart, and they will go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them, and it shall be as this girdle which shall not profit for anything.[11]For as the girdle will adhere to the loins of a man, so did I cause to adhere to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah, says Jehovah: to be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for glory: and they heard not.[12]And say to them this word: Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Every flask shall be filled with wine: and they said to thee, Knowing, shall it not be known that every flask shall be filled with wine?[13]And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me filling all inhabiting this land, and all the kings sitting to David upon his throne, and the priests and the prophets, and all inhabiting Jerusalem, with drunkenness.[14]And I dashed them in pieces, a man against his brother, and the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah.

or a vessel no delight in it? wherefore they were cast out, he and his seed, and they were cast upon a land which they knew not.[29]O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.[30]Thus said Jehovah, Write ye this man destitute, a man shall not prosper in his days: for not a man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling yet in Judah.","Jer.23":"[1]Wo to the shepherds destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture! says Jehovah.[2]For this, thus said Jehovah God of Israel, against the shepherds feeding my people: Ye scattered my flock and ye will thrust them away, and ye reviewed them not: behold me reviewing over you the evil of your doings, says Jehovah.[3]And I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I thrust them away there, and I turned them back to their rests, and they were fruitful and multiplied.[4]And I set up shepherds over them, and they fed them; and they shall no more fear, and they shall not be terrified, and they shall not be reviewed, says Jehovah.[5]Behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and I raised up to David a just sprout, and a king reigned and prospered, and he did judgment and justice in the earth.[6]In his days shall Judah be saved, and Israel shall dwell with confidence: and this his name which he shall be called: Jehovah Our Justice.[7]For this, behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and they shall no more say, Jehovah lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.[8]But But Jehovah lives who brought up and who caused the seed of the house of Israel to come from the land of the north, and from all the lands where I thrust them away there; and they shall dwell upon their land.[9]For the prophets my heart was broken in the midst of me, and all my bones were relaxed; I was as a man intoxicated, and as a man wine passing over him, from the face of Jehovah, and from the face of the words of his holiness.[10]For the land was filled from adulteries, for from the face of these the land mourned, the beautiful things of the desert were dried up, and their race will be evil, and their strength not right.[11]For also the prophets, also the priests were polluted; also in my house I found their evil, says Jehovah.[12]For this their way shall be to them as slippery places in darkness: they shall be thrust away and they fell in it; for I will bring evil upon them, the year of their reviewing, says Jehovah.[13]And I saw folly in the prophets of Shomeron; they prophesied in Baal, and they will cause my people Israel to wander.[14]And in the prophets of Jerusalem I saw a horrible thing, committing adultery and going in falsehood: and they strengthened the hands of those doing evil, they turned not back a man from his evil: they were to me all of them as Sodom, and those dwelling in her as Gomorrah.[15]For this, thus said Jehovah of armies concerning the prophets, Behold me feeding them with wormwood, and I caused to drink the water of poison: for from the prophets of Jerusalem went forth profaneness to all the earth.[16]Thus said Jehovah of armies, Ye shall not hear to the words of the prophets prophesying to you; they making you vain: they will speak the vision of their heart, not from the mouth of Jehovah.[17]Saying to say to those despising the word of Jehovah, There shall be peace to you; and every one going in the stubbornness of his heart, they said, Evil shall not come to you.[18]For who stood in the consultation of Jehovah, and will see and hear his word who attended to his word and will hear?[19]Behold, the storm of Jehovah went forth with wrath, a piercing storm; it shall be hurled upon the head of the evil ones.[20]The anger of Jehovah shall not turn back till his doing, and till his setting up the purposes of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall understand in it with understanding.[21]I sent not the prophets, and they ran; I spake not to them, and they prophesied.[22]And if they stood in my consultation, and they will cause my people to hear my word, and turn them back from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.[23]Am I God from near, says Jehovah, and not God from far off?[24]If a man shall hide in secret places and I shall not see him, says Jehovah. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? says Jehovah.[25]I heard what the prophets said, prophesying a falsehood in my name, saying, I dreamed, I dreamed.[26]How long is it in the heart of the prophets prophesying a lie, and prophesying the deceit of their heart?[27]Reckoning to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they will recount a man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name in Baal.[28]The prophet whom with him a dream, he will recount a dream; and whom my word with him, he will speak my word in truth. What to the straw with the grain? says Jehovah.[29]So is not my word as fire? says Jehovah; and as a hammer, it will break the rock in pieces.[30]For this, behold me against the prophets, says Jehovah, stealing my words, a man from his neighbor.[31]Behold me against the prophets, says Jehovah, taking their tongue, and they will mutter an oracle.[32]Behold me against them prophesying dreams of falsehood, says Jehovah, and they will recount them, and will cause my people to wander by their falsehoods and by their boasting; and I sent them not, and I commanded them not; and helping, they shall be of no profit to this people, says Jehovah.[33]And when this people, or prophet, or priest, shall ask thee, saying, What the burden of Jehovah? and thou saidst to them, What burden? And I cast you off, says Jehovah.[34]And the prophet and the priest and the people which shall say, The burden of Jehovah, and I reviewed upon that man, and upon his house.[35]Thus shall ye say, a man to his neighbor, a man to his brother, What answered Jehovah? and what spake Jehovah?[36]And ye shall no more make mention of the burden of Jehovah, for the burden to a man shall be his word; and ye perverted the words of the living God, Jehovah of armies our God.[37]Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What answered Jehovah? and what spake Jehovah?[38]And if ye shall say, The burden of Jehovah; for this, thus said Jehovah, Because ye said this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I shall send to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah:[39]Therefore behold me, and neglecting, I deserted you, and I cast you off, and the city which I gave to you and to your fathers from my face.[40]And I gave upon you an eternal reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.","Jer.24":"[1]Jehovah showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the face of the temple of Jehovah, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel carried away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the chiefs of Judah and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem, and he will bring them to Babel.[2]One basket of figs exceedingly good as the figs first ripe, and the one basket of figs exceedingly evil, which shall not be eaten from being evil.[3]And Jehovah will say to me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? and saying, Figs: the good figs, exceedingly good; and the evil, exceedingly evil, which shall not be eaten from being evil.[4]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[5]Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: As these good figs, so will I know the captivity of Judah which I sent out of this place to the land of the Chaldeans for good.[6]And I set mine eyes upon them for good, and I turned them back upon this land: and I built them, and I will not pull down: and I planted them, and I will not pluck up.[7]And I gave to them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God: for they shall turn back to me with all their heart.[8]And as the evil figs which shall not be eaten from being evil; for thus said Jehovah, So will I give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his chiefs, and the remainder of Jerusalem, those remaining in this land, and those dwelling in the land of Egypt:[9]And I gave them for maltreatment, and for evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, for a reproach and for a parable, and for a derision, and for a curse in, all the places which I shall thrust them away there.[10]And I sent among them the sword, the famine, and the death, even to the consuming them from off the land which I gave to them and to their fathers.","Jer.25":"[1]The word which was to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year to Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this the first year to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel.[2]Which Jeremiah the prophet spake to all the people of Judah, all dwelling in Jerusalem, saying,[3]From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, and even to this day, this the three and twentieth year, the word of Jehovah was to me, and I will speak to you, rising early and speaking, and ye heard not.[4]And Jehovah sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending; and ye heard not, and ye inclined not your ear to hear.[5]Saying, Turn back now each from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell upon the land which Jehovah gave to you and to your fathers to from forever and even to forever.[6]And ye shall not go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them, and ye shall not irritate me in the work of your hands; and I will not do evil to you.[7]And ye heard not to me, says Jehovah; so as to irritate me in the works of your hands for evil to you.[8]For this, thus said Jehovah of armies: Because ye heard not my word,[9]Behold me sending, and I took all the families of the north, says Jehovah, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant, and I brought them against this land and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about, and I devoted them to destruction, and I set them for a desolation and for a hissing, and for perpetual wastes.[10]And I destroyed from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of the two millstones and the light of the lamp.[11]All this land was for a waste, for a desolation, and these nations served the king of Babel seventy years.[12]And it was when seventy years were filled up, I will review over the king of Babel and upon this nation, says Jehovah, their iniquity, and upon the land of the Chaldeans, and I set it for eternal desolations.[13]And I brought upon this land all the words I spake against it, all being in this book which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.[14]For many nations they also served upon them, and great kings: and I requited to them according to their work and according to the doings of their hands.[15]For thus said Jehovah God of Israel to me: Take the cup of wine of this wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations which I sent thee to them to drink it.[16]And they drank and they staggered, and they were mad from the face of the sword which I sent in the midst of them.[17]And I shall take the cup from the hand of Jehovah, and I shall cause all the nations which Jehovah sent me to them to drink.[18]Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and her kings, her chiefs, to give them for a waste and for a desolation, and for a hissing and for a cursing; as this day.[19]Pharaoh king of Egypt and his servants, and his chiefs, and all his people.[20]And all the intermingled, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the rovers, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,[21]Edom and Moab and the sons of Ammon,[22]And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the island which is beyond the sea,[23]Dedan and Tema, and Buz, and all the cutting off the extremity,[24]And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the intermingled dwelling in the desert,[25]And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes.[26]And all the kings of the North, being near and being far off, a man to his brother, and all the kingdoms of the land which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.[27]And say to them, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Drink ye and be drunken, and vomit and fall, and ye shall not rise from the face of the sword which I sent in the midst of you.[28]And it was if they shall refuse to take the cup from my hand to drink, and say to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies: Drink ye; ye shall drink.[29]For behold me beginning to do evil upon the city which my name was called upon it; and shall ye being acquitted be unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished, for I call a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of armies.[30]And thou shalt prophesy to them all these words, and say to them; Jehovah shall roar from on high, and he will give his voice from his holy habitation; roaring, he will roar from his seat; he shall cry aloud as they treading, to all the inhabitants of the earth.[31]A noise came even to the extremity of the earth; for a strife to Jehovah with the nations; he judged for all flesh; he gave them being evil, to the sword, says Jehovah.[32]Thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.[33]And the wounded of Jehovah were in that day from the extremity of the earth and even to the extremity of the earth: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.[34]Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves, ye chiefs of the flocks; for your days for slaughter and your dispersions were filled up, and ye fell as a vessel of desire.[35]And flight perished from the shepherds, and escaping from the chiefs of the flock.[36]A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and wailing of the chiefs of the flock, for Jehovah laid waste their pasture.[37]And the dwellings of peace were destroyed from the face of the burning of the anger of Jehovah.[38]He forsook his booth as the young lion: for their land was for a desolation from the face of the burning of him oppressing, and from the face of the burning of his anger.","Jer.26":"[1]In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, was this word from Jehovah, saying,[2]Thus said Jehovah, Stand in the enclosure of the house of Jehovah and speak to all the cities of Judah coming to worship in the house of Jehovah, all the words which I command thee to speak to them; thou shalt not withhold a word.[3]Perhaps they will hear and turn back a man from his evil way, and I lamented for the evil which I purposed to do to them from the face of the evil of their doings.[4]And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, If ye will not hear to me to go in my law which I gave before your face,[5]To hear to the words of my servants the prophets which I sent to you, and rising early and sending, and ye heard not;[6]And I gave this house as Shiloh, and this city I will give for cursing to all the nations of the earth.[7]And the priests and the prophets and all the people will hear Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.[8]And it will be as Jeremiah finished to speak all which Jehovah commanded to speak to all the people, and the priests and the prophets and all the people will seize him, saying, Dying, thou shalt die.[9]Wherefore didst thou prophesy in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be as Shiloh, and this city shall be laid waste from none inhabiting? And all the people will be convoked together to Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.[10]And the chiefs of Judah will hear these words, and they will come up from the king’s house to the house of Jehovah, and they will sit in the opening of the new gate of Jehovah.[11]And the priests and the prophets will say to the chiefs, and to all the people, saying, The judgment of death for this man, for he prophesied against this city, as ye heard with your ears.[12]And Jeremiah will say to all the chiefs and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words which ye heard.[13]And now make good your ways and your doings, and hear to the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will lament for the evil which he spake against you.[14]And I, behold me in your hand do to me as the good and right in your eyes:[15]But knowing, ye shall know that if ye put me to death, that ye give innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city, and to her inhabitants: for in truth Jehovah sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words.[16]And the chiefs will say, and all the people to the priests and to the prophets: Not for this man the judgment of death, for in the name of Jehovah his God he spake to us.[17]And men will rise up from the old men of the land, and they will say to all the convocation of the people, saying,[18]Micah the Morasthite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and he will say to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies: Zion shall be ploughed a field, and Jerusalem shall be ruins, and the mountain of the house for the heights of a forest.[19]Putting to death, did Hezekiah king of Judah put him to death, and all Judah? Did he not fear Jehovah, and wait for the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah will lament for the evil which he spake against them? And we are doing great evil against our souls.[20]And also a man was prophesying in the name of Jehovah, Urijah son of Shemaiah, from the city of the forests, and he will prophesy against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.[21]And king Jehoiakim will hear, and all the great ones, and all the chiefs, his words, and the king will seek to kill him: and Urijah will hear and be afraid, and he will flee and go to Egypt.[22]And king Jehoiakim will send men to Egypt, Elnathan, son of Achbor, and men with him to Egypt.[23]And they will bring forth Urijah from Egypt and bring him to king Jehoiakim; and he will strike him with the sword, and cast his carcass into the graves of the sons of the people.[24]But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah not to give him into the hand of the people to kill him.","Jer.27":"[1]In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah was this word to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,[2]Thus said Jehovah to me: Make to thee bonds and rods and give them upon thy neck,[3]And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the sons of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of messengers coming to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;[4]And command them to say to their lords, Thus said Jehovah of armies God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to your lords:[5]I made the earth, the man and the cattle which are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by mine arm stretched forth, and I gave it to whom was right in mine eyes.[6]And now I gave all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant; and also the beasts of the field gave I to him to serve him.[7]And all the nations served him, and his son, and his son’s son, even till the time itself also of his land came: and many nations and great kings served upon him.[8]And it was the nation and kingdom which shall not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and which shall not give his neck in the yoke of the king of Babel, with the sword and with famine and with death I will review upon that nation, says Jehovah, even to my finishing them by his hand.[9]And ye shall not hear to your prophets and to your divinations, and to your dreamers, and to those of you practicing magic, and to your sorcerers, which they are saying to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babel:[10]For they are prophesying a lie to you so as to remove you far off from your land; and I thrust you away, and ye perished.[11]And the nation which shall bring his neck into the yoke of the king of Babel and serve him, and I gave him rest upon his land, says Jehovah; and he worked it, and dwelt in it.[12]And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spake according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks into the yoke of the king of Babel, and serve him and his people, and live.[13]Wherefore will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword and by famine and by death, as Jehovah spake against the nation who will not serve the king of Babel?[14]And ye shall not bear to the words of the prophets, saying to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babel; for they are prophesying a lie to you.[15]For I sent them not, says Jehovah, and they are prophesying in my name for falsehood; for my thrusting you away, and ye perish, ye, and the prophets prophesying to you.[16]And to the priests and to all this people I spake, saying, Thus said Jehovah: Ye shall not hear to the words of your prophets prophesying to you, saying, Behold the vessels of the house of Jehovah being now turned back from Babel speedily: for they are prophesying a lie to you.[17]Ye shall not hear to them; serve ye the king of Babel, and live: wherefore shall this city be laid waste?[18]And if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, they shall now supplicate to Jehovah of armies for the vessels being left in the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king of Judah, in Jerusalem, not to go into Babel.[19]For thus said Jehovah of armies concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the remainder of the vessels being left in this city.[20]Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel took them not in his carrying away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem into Babel, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.[21]For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, concerning the vessels being left in the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king of Judah and Jerusalem:[22]They shall be brought to Babel, and there shall they be till the day of my reviewing them, says Jehovah;

but make instead of them staves of iron.[14]For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, I gave an iron yoke upon the neck of all these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel: and they served him: and also the beasts of the field I gave to him.[15]And Jeremiah the prophet will say to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; Jehovah sent thee not; and thou didst cause this people to trust upon falsehood.[16]For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me sending thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou diest, because thou spakest turning away against Jehovah.[17]And Hananiah the prophet will die in this year in the seventh month.","Jer.29":"[1]And these the words of the writing which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remnant of the old men of the captivity, and to the priests and to the prophets, and to all the people which Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babel;[2](After the going forth of Jeconiah, the king and the mistress, and the eunuchs, the chiefs of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem;)[3]By the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, into Babel) saying,[4]Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, to all the captivity, which I caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem into Babel:[5]Build ye houses and dwell;

purposes of peace, and not for evil, to give to you the last part and expectation.[12]And ye called me, and went and prayed to me, and I heard to you.[13]And ye sought me and found, for ye will seek me with all your heart.[14]And I was found to you, says Jehovah: and I turned back your captivity, and I gathered you from all the nations, and from all the places where I thrust you away there says Jehovah;

plant gardens, and eat their fruit.[29]And Zephaniah the priest will read this writing in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.[30]And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,[31]Send to all the captivity, saying, Thus said Jehovah to Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he will cause you to trust in falsehood:[32]For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me reviewing upon Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and upon his seed: there shall not be to him a man in the midst of this people; and he shall not look upon the good I do to ray people, says Jehovah; for he spake turning away against Jehovah.","Jer.30":"[1]The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,[2]Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words which I spake to thee upon the writing.[3]For behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I turned back the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, said Jehovah: and I turned them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall inherit it.[4]And these the words which Jehovah spake to Israel and to Judah.[5]For thus said Jehovah; We heard the voice of fear and of terror, and not of peace.[6]Ask ye now, and see if a male brought forth? wherefore did I see every man his hands upon his loins as she bringing forth, and all faces were turned to paleness?[7]Alas! for that day is great from none being like it: and this the time of straits to Jacob and he shall be saved from it.[8]And it was in that day, says Jehovah of armies, I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and I will tear away thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve upon him.[9]And they served Jehovah their God, and David their king whom I will raise up to them.[10]And thou my servant Jacob shall not fear, says Jehovah, and thou Israel shalt not be dismayed: for behold me saving thee from far off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob turned back and rested, and was quiet, and none making afraid.[11]For I am with thee, says Jehovah, to serve thee: for I will make a completion to all nations where I scattered thee there, but with thee I will not make a completion: and I corrected thee for judgment, and acquitting, I will not let thee go unpunished.[12]For thus said Jehovah, Thy breaking is incurable, and thy blow sickly.[13]None judging thy judgment for binding up: no healing will come up to thee.[14]All loving thee forgat thee; they will not seek thee; for I struck thee the blow of an enemy, the correction of the cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; thy sins were strong.[15]Why wilt thou cry for thy breaking? thy pain is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: thy sins were strong, I did these things to thee.[16]For this, all consuming thee shall be consumed; and all thine adversaries, all of them shall go into captivity; and they spoiling thee, were for spoiling, and all plundering thee I will give to plunder.[17]For I will bring up healing to thee, and I will heal thee of thy blows, says Jehovah: for they called to thee an outcast: This is Zion, none seeking for her.[18]Thus said Jehovah, Behold me turning back the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and I will compassionate his habitations; and the city was built upon her hill, and the palace sat upon its judgment.[19]And thanksgiving shall go forth from them, and the voice of those playing, and I multiplied them, and they shall not be few; and I honored them, and they shall not be small.[20]And their sons were as of old, and their testimony shall be prepared before me, and I reviewed upon all pressing them,[21]And his mighty one was from himself, and his ruler shall go forth from his midst; and I caused him to draw near, and he came near to me: for who this pledging his heart to approach to me? says Jehovah.[22]And ye were to me for a people, and I will be to you for God.[23]Behold, the storm of Jehovah went forth with wrath, a cutting storm: it shall be hurled upon the head of the wicked.[24]The burning of the anger of Jehovah shall not turn, back till his doing, and till his setting up the thoughts of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall have understanding in it.","Jer.31":"[1]In that time, says Jehovah, I will be for God to all the families of Israel, and they shall be to me for a people.[2]Thus said Jehovah, The people escaped of the sword found grace in the desert; Israel going to cause him to rest.[3]Jehovah was seen to me from afar off; and I loved thee an eternal love: for this I drew thee in kindness.[4]I will yet build thee, and thou wert built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt yet be adorned with the tabret, and thou wentest forth into the dance of those playing.[5]Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Shomeron: they planting, planted, and they made common.[6]For there is a day they watching upon mount Ephraim called, Arise ye, and we will go up to Zion to Jehovah our God.[7]For thus said Jehovah, Shout gladness to Jacob, and cry aloud to the head of the nations: cause ye to be heard, praise ye and say, O Jehovah save thy people, the remnant of Israel.[8]Behold me bringing them from the land of the north, and I gathered them from the thighs of the earth, with them the blind and the lame, her being Pregnant, and her bringing forth together: a great convocation shall turn back hither.[9]In weeping will they come, and I will lead them in mercies; I will cause them to go to the streams of waters in a straight way; they shall not stumble in it: for I was to Israel for a father, and Ephraim he is my first-born.[10]Hear the word of Jehovah, ye nations, and announce in the islands from far off, and say, He scattering Israel will gather him, and watch him as the shepherd his flock.[11]For Jehovah redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of the stronger than he.[12]And they came and shouted in the height of Zion, and they flowed together to the goodness of Jehovah, for the grain and for the new wine, and for the oil, and for the sons of the flock and the herd: and their soul was as a watered garden, and they shall not add to pine away any more.[13]Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old men together: and I turned their mourning to joy, and I comforted them and caused them to rejoice from their sorrow.[14]And I satiated the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Jehovah.[15]Thus said Jehovah, A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping of bitterness; Rachel, weeping for her sons, refused to be comforted for her sons, for they are not.[16]Thus said Jehovah, Restrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for there is a reward to thy work, says Jehovah; and they turned back from the land of the enemy.[17]And there is hope to thy latter state, says Jehovah, and thy sons turned back to their bound.[18]Hearing, I heard Ephraim being thrust away: Thou didst correct me, and I shall be corrected as a calf not being taught: turn me back and I shall be turned back, for thou Jehovah my God.[19]For after my being turned back I was comforted; and after my knowing I struck upon the thigh: I was ashamed and also disgraced for I bore the reproach of my youth.[20]Is Ephraim a precious son to me? if a child of delights? for whenever my speaking against him, remembering, I shall remember him yet; for this the bowels were put in motion to me compassionating, I will compassionate him, says Jehovah.[21]Set up to thee thorns, set to thee bitternesses: place thy heart to the highway, the way thou wentest: turn back, O virgin of Israel, turn back to these thy cities.[22]How long wilt thou wander about, O daughter turning away? for Jehovah created a new thing in the earth: A female shall go about a male.[23]Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Yet shall they say this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, in my turning back their captivity; Jehovah shall bless thee, thou habitation of justice, thou mountain of holiness.[24]And in Judah shall dwell in it, and in all its cities together, husbandmen, and they removed with the flock.[25]For I satiated the weary soul, and every soul pining away I filled.[26]Upon this I awoke, and I shall see; and my sleep sweet to me.[27]Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I sowed the house of Israel and the house of Judah, the seed of man and the seed of beast.[28]And it was as I watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to destroy and to cut off, and to break in pieces; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Jehovah.[29]In those days they shall no more say, The fathers ate sour grapes and the sons teeth will be blunted.[30]But each shall die in his iniquity: every man eating the sour grape, his teeth shall become dull.[31]Behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and I cut out the house of Israel and the house of Judah a new covenant.[32]Not according to the covenant which I cut out with their fathers in the day I laid hold upon their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt; which they brake my covenant, and I was Lord over them, says Jehovah.[33]For this the covenant that I will cut out with the house of Israel: After those days, says Jehovah; I gave my law in the midst of them, and upon their heart will I write it; and I was to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people.[34]And they shall teach no more a man his neighbor and a man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah: for they all shall know me to their small and even to their great, says Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and to their sin I will have no more remembrance.[35]Thus said Jehovah, giving the sun for light the day, the laws of the moon and the stars for a light the night, causing the sea to tremble, and its waves shall roar; Jehovah of armies his name.[36]If these laws shall depart from my face, says Jehovah, also the seed of Israel shall cease from being a nation before me all the days.[37]Thus said Jehovah: If the heavens from above shall be measured, and the foundations of the earth shall be searched out beneath, I also will reject in all the seed of Israel for all which they did, says Jehovah.[38]Behold the days, says Jehovah, and the city was built to Jehovah, from the tower of Hananeel, even to the gate of the corner.[39]And the line of measure shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and it went about Goath.[40]And all the valley of the carcasses and the ashes, and all the fields even to the torrent Kidron, even to the corner of the gate of horses, from the sunrising, a holy place to Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, and it shall no more be destroyed forever.","Jer.32":"[1]The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year to Zedekiah king of Judah, this year the eighteenth year to Nebuchadnezzar.[2]And then the strength of the king of Babel pressed upon Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the enclosure of the prison which was in the house of the king of Judah.[3]For Zedekiah king of Judah shut him up, saying, Wherefore prophesiest thou, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the king of Babel, and he took it.[4]And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for giving, he shall be given into the hand of the king of Babel, and speaking to him, his mouth with his mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes:[5]And he shall call Zedekiah to go to Babel, and he shall be there till my reviewing him, says Jehovah: if ye shall war with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.[6]And Jeremiah will say, The word of Jehovah was to me, saying,[7]Behold, Hanameel son of Shallum thine uncle, coming to thee, saying, Buy to thee my field which is in Anathoth: for to thee the judgment of redemption today.[8]And Hanameel mine uncle’s son will come to me according to the word of Jehovah, to the enclosure of the prison, and he will say to me, Buy now, my field, which is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin: for to thee judgment of possession, and to thee the redemption; buy to thee, and I shall know that this is the word of Jehovah.[9]And I shall buy the field of Hanameel son of mine uncle, which is in Anathoth; and I shall weigh to him seven shekels and ten of silver.[10]And I shall write in a book, and seal and affirm witnesses, and weigh the silver in the balances.[11]And I will take the book of the purchase, being sealed, the command and laws, and being unrolled:[12]And I shall give the writing of the purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel mine uncle, and before the eyes of the witnesses, writing in the book of the purchase before the eves of all the Jews sitting in the enclosure of the prison.[13]And I shall command Baruch before their eyes, saying,[14]Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, take these writings, this writing of the purchase, and the sealed, and this writing unrolled, and give them into an earthern vessel, so that they shall stand many days.[15]For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet be bought in this land.[16]And I shall pray to Jehovah, after my giving the writing of the purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, saying,[17]Thou Lord Jehovah! behold thou madest the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine arm stretched forth; any word shall not be separated from thee.[18]Doing kindness to thousands and requiting the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them: The Great, The Strong God, Jehovah of armies his name.[19]Great of counsel, and vast of doing: for thine eyes being opened upon all the ways of the sons of men to give to each according to his ways, and to the fruit of his doings:[20]Who set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and in man; and thou wilt make to thee a name according to this day.[21]And thou wilt bring forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an arm stretched forth, and with great fear:[22]And thou wilt give to them this land which thou swarest to their fathers to give to them, a land flowing milk and honey.[23]And they will come in and possess it; and they heard not to thy voice, and they went not in thy law; all which thou didst command to them to do they did not, and thou wilt cause all this evil to befall them.[24]Behold the mounds, they came to the city to take it; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldees warring against it from the face of the sword, and the famine, and the death; and it was what thou spakest; and behold thee seeing.[25]And thou saidst to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy to thee the field for silver, and affirm witnesses; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.[26]And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,[27]Behold, I am Jehovah, God of all flesh: is there any word separated from me?[28]For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and he took it.[29]And the Chaldeans warring against this city came, and they burnt this city in fire, and they burnt it and the houses which they burnt incense upon their roofs to Baal, and they poured out libations to other gods to irritate me.[30]For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah were only doing evil in mine eyes from their youth: for the sons of Israel were only irritating me with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.[31]For this city was to me for mine anger and for my wrath, from the day which they built it and even to this day, to remove it from my face.[32]For all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to irritate me, they, their kings, their chiefs, their priests, and their prophets, and the man Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.[33]And they will turn to me the neck and not the face: and teaching them, and rising early and teaching, and they not hearing to receive instruction.[34]And they will set their abominations in the house which my name was called upon it, to defile it.[35]And they will build the heights of Baal which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through to Molech, which I commanded them not; and it came not up upon my heart to do this abomination to cause Judah to sin.[36]And now for this, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, to this city of which ye are saying, It was given into the hand of the king of Babel by sword and by famine, and by death.[37]Behold me gathering them from all the lands where I thrust them away there in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great anger; and I turned them back to this place, and I caused them to dwell with confidence.[38]And they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.[39]And I gave to them one heart and one way, to fear me all the days, for good to them and to their sons after them.[40]And I cut out to them an eternal covenant that I will not turn back from after them, to do them good; and I will give my fear in their heart not to turn away from me.[41]And I rejoiced over them to do them good, and I planted them in this land in truth with all my heart and with all my soul.[42]For thus said Jehovah, As I brought to this people all this great evil, so I bring upon them all the good which I speak concerning them.[43]And the field was purchased in in this land which ye are saying, It is a desolation without man and cattle; it was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.[44]They shall buy fields with silver, and write thou in the book, and seal and affirm witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn back their captivity, says Jehovah.","Jer.33":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah the second time, and he yet shut up in the enclosure of the prison, saying,[2]Thus said Jehovah making it Jehovah forming it, to prepare it, Jehovah his name:[3]Call to me and I will answer thee, and I will announce to thee great and mighty things which thou knewest them not.[4]For thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, being torn away to the mounds and to the sword;[5]Coming to war with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of man whom I struck in mine anger and in my wrath, and that I hid my face from this city for all their wickedness.[6]Behold me bringing up to it health and healing, and healing them, and I uncovered to them the abundance of peace and truth.[7]And I turned back the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel and I built them as at the first.[8]And I cleansed them from all their iniquity which they sinned to me, and which they transgressed against me.[9]And it was to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for an honor to all the nations of the earth who shall hear all the good which I did them: and they trembled and were moved for all the good and for all the peace which I did to it.[10]Thus said Jehovah: Yet shall be heard in this place which ye were saying it was laid waste without man and without cattle, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, being desolate without man and without inhabitant, and without cattle,[11]The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying, Praise ye Jehovah of armies: for Jehovah is good, for his mercy is forever: of them bringing thanksgiving to the house of Jehovah; for I will turn back the captivity of the land as at the first, said Jehovah.[12]Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet shall be in this place being laid waste without man and without cattle, and in all its cities, the habitation of the shepherds causing the sheep to lie down.[13]In the cities of the mountain, in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the sheep yet pass through upon the hand of him numbering, said Jehovah.[14]Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I raised up the good word which I spake to the house of Israel and for the house of Judah.[15]In those days and in that time I will cause the sprout of justice to spring up to David; and he did judgment and justice in the land.[16]In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell with confidence; and this is what shall be called to her: Jehovah our Justice.[17]For thus said Jehovah, I will not cut off to David a man sitting upon the throne of the house of Israel;[18]And to the priests, the Levites, I will not cut off a man from my face bringing up burnt-offerings, and burning the gift, and doing sacrifice all the days.[19]And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,[20]Thus said Jehovah, If ye shall break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, and there was not day and night in their season;[21]Also my covenant shall be broken with David ray servant from there being to him a son reigning upon his throne; and with the Levites, the priests, from serving me.[22]As the army of the heavens shall not be numbered and the sand of the sea shall not be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites serving me.[23]And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,[24]Sawest thou not what this people spake, saying, The two families which Jehovah chose in them, and he will reject them? and they will despise my people from being yet a nation before them.[25]Thus said Jehovah, If not my covenant of the day and of the night, the laws of the heavens and the earth I set not up.[26]Also the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, will I reject from taking from his seed those ruling over the seed of Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob for I will turn back their captivity, and I compassionated them.","Jer.34":"[1]The word that was to Jeremiah from Jehovah and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and all his strength, and all the kingdoms of the earth, the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples warring against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying.[2]Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Go and say to Zedekiah king of Judah, and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the band of the king of Babel, and he burnt it with fire.[3]And thou shalt not escape from his hand, for being seized, thou shalt be seized and be given into his hand; and thine eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babel, and his mouth shall speak to thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babel.[4]But hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah, king of Judah: Thus said Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:[5]In peace shalt thou die; and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee, thus shall they burn for thee; and, Alas, Lord they shall mourn for thee; for I spake the word, says Jehovah.[6]And Jeremiah the prophet will speak to Zedekiah king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem.[7]And the strength of the king of Babel warred against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah being left against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these remained of the cities of Judah, fortified cities.[8]The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah after king Zedekiah cut out a covenant with all the people which were in Jerusalem, to call to them liberty;[9]For a man to send away his servant, and a man his maid, the Hebrew or the Hebrewess, free; for a man not to serve with them with a Jew his brother.[10]And all the chiefs will hear, and all the people which came into the covenant, to send away a man his servant and a man his maid, free, no more to serve with them, and they will hear and will send away.[11]And they will turn back after this, and they will cause their servants and their maids to turn back whom they sent away free, and they subdued them for servants and for maids.[12]And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,[13]Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I cut out a covenant with your fathers in the day of my bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants, saying,[14]From the end of seven years ye shall send away a man his brother, the Hebrew who shall be sold to thee, and serving thee six years, and send him away free from thee; and your fathers heard not to me and inclined not their ear.[15]And ye will turn back today and do the straight in mine eyes, to call liberty a man to his neighbor; and ye will cut out a covenant before me in the house which my name was called upon it.[16]And ye will turn back and pollute my name, and ye will cause to turn back a man his servant and a man his maid, whom ye sent away free to their soul, and ye will subdue them to be to you for servants and for maids.[17]For this, thus said Jehovah, Ye heard not to me to call liberty, a man to his brother and a man to his neighbor behold me calling to you liberty, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the death and to the famine; and I gave you for agitation to all the kingdoms of the earth.[18]And I gave the men passing by my covenant who raised not up the words of the covenant which they cut out before me, the calf which they cut in two, and they will pass through between its parts.[19]The chiefs of Judah, and the chiefs of Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land passing between the parts of the calf.[20]And I gave them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking their soul; and their corpses were for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.[21]And Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his chiefs, I will give into the hand of their enemies, and, into the hand of those seeking their soul, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babel going up from you.[22]Behold me commanding, says Jehovah;

and vineyard and field and seed shall not be to us.[10]And we will dwell in tents, and we will hear and we will do according to all which Jonadab our father commanded us.[11]And it will be in the coming up of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, to the land, and we shall say, Come, and we will go to Jerusalem from the face of the army of the Chaldean, and from the face of the army of Aram, and we will dwell in Jerusalem.[12]And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,[13]Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Go and say to the man Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hear to my word? says Jehovah.[14]The words of Jonadab son of Rechab who commanded his sons not to drink wine, were raised up; and they drank not even to this clay, for they heard the command of their father: and spake to you, rising early and speaking; and ye heard not to me.[15]And I shall send to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Turn ye back now each from his evil way, and make good your doings, and ye shall not go after other gods to serve them, and turn ye back to the land which I gave to you and to your fathers: and ye inclined not your ear and ye heard not to me.[16]For the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab raised up the commands of their father which be commanded them; and this people heard not to me.[17]For this, thus said Jehovah, God of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing to Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil which I spake concerning them; because I spake to them and they heard not; and I shall call to them and they answered not.[18]And Jeremiah said to the house of the Reehabites, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Because that ye heard to the command of Jonadab your father, and ye will watch all his commands, and ye will do all which he commanded you:[19]For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, A man shall not be cut off to Jonadab son of Rechab, to stand before my face all the days.","Jer.36":"[1]And it will be in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah king of Judah, this word being to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,[2]Take to thee a roll of writing, and write in it all the words which I spake to thee against Israel and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake to thee from the days of Josiah and even to this day.[3]Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them;

they shall fall by the sword and by famine: they shall be consumed from small and even to great, by the sword and by famine: they shall die, and they were for an oath, and for a, desolation, and for a curse, and for a reproach.[13]And I reviewed over those dwelling in the land of Egypt, as I reviewed over Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine and by death.[14]And there shall not be escaping or fleeing to the remnant of Judah going to sojourn there in the land of Egypt, to turn back to the land of Judah, which they lift up their soul to turn back to dwell there: for they shall not turn back but the escaped.[15]And they will answer Jeremiah, all the men knowing that their wives burn incense to other gods, and all the women standing, a great convocation, and all the people dwelling in the land of Egypt in Pathros, saying,[16]The word which thou spakest to us in the name of Jehovah, we hear not to thee.[17]But doing, we will do all the word which went forth from our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, to pour out libations to her, as we did, we and our fathers, our kings and our chiefs in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: and we shall be filled with bread, and we shall be well, and see not evil.[18]From then we ceased to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to her, we wanted all things, and were consumed by sword and by famine.[19]And when we burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and pour out libations to her, did we without our men make cakes to her, to serve her, and pour out libations to her?[20]And Jeremiah will say to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people answering him the word, saying,[21]The incense which ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your chiefs, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and it will come up upon his heart?[22]And Jehovah shall no more be able to lift up from the face of the evil of your doings from the face of the abominations which ye did; and your land shall be for a waste, and for an astonishment, and for a curse, without any inhabitant, as this day.[23]From the face of what ye burned incense, and what ye sinned against Jehovah, and ye heard not to the voice of Jehovah, and in his instructions and in his laws and in his testimonies ye went not; for this, this evil befell you as this day.[24]And Jeremiah will say to all the people, and to all the women, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all, Judah who are in the land of Egypt:[25]Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives, and ye will speak with your mouth, and with your hands ye filled up; saying, Doing, we will do our vows which we vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to her: setting up, ye will set up your vows, and doing, ye will do your vows.[26]For this, hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah dwelling in the land of Egypt: Behold, I sware by my great name, said Jehovah, if my name shall yet be called by the mouth of all the men of Judah, saying, The Lord Jehovah lives, in all the land of Egypt.[27]Behold me watching over them for evil and not for good: and they were consumed, all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt, by sword and by famine, even till their finishing.[28]And escaping the sword there shall turn back from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, men of number, and all the remnant of Judah going to the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall be raised up from me and from them.[29]And this a sign to you, says Jehovah, that I review upon you in this place, so that ye shall know that raising up, I will raise up my word against you for evil.[30]Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving Pharaoh-Hophra, king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, seeking his soul; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, his enemy, and seeking his soul.","Jer.45":"[1]The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake to Baruch, son of Neriah, in his writing these words up on the book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year to Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,[2]Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch;[3]Thou saidst, Wo to me now! for Jehovah added grief upon my pain; I was weary in my sighing, and I found not rest.[4]Thus shalt thou say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Behold, what I built I pulled down, and what I planted I plucked up, and all this land.[5]And thou, wilt thou seek great things to thyself? thou shalt not seek: for behold me bringing evil upon all flesh, says Jehovah: and I gave to thee thy soul for a booty to all the places where thou shalt go there.","Jer.46":"[1]The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah the prophet against the nations;[2]To Egypt against the army of Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt, that was upon the river Phrath in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel smote in the fourth year to Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah.[3]Prepare the covering and the shield, and approach to the war.[4]Harness the horses, and come up, ye horsemen, and stand in the helmets; polish the spears, and put on the coats of mail.[5]Wherefore did I see them terrified, drawing back behind? and their strong ones shall be broken, and they fled a flight, and they turned not: fear being round about, says Jehovah.[6]The swift shall not flee away, and the strong shall not escape: to the north upon the hand of the river Phrath they stumbled and fell.[7]Who this as a river he shall come up, as the rivers his waters shall be moved?[8]Egypt as a river will come up, and as rivers the waters will be moved; and he will say, I will go up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and those dwelling in it.[9]Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and the strong ones shall come forth: Cush and Phut seizing the shield; and the Ludims, bending the bow.[10]And that the day to the Lord Jehovah of armies, a day of vengeance to be avenged of his adversaries: and the sword consumed and was satiated, and drunk their blood to the full; for a sacrifice to the Lord Jehovah of armies in the land of the north by the river Phrath.[11]Go up to Gilead, and take balsam, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou bring up many healings; none to thee.[12]The nations heard thy shame, and thy outcry filled the land: for the strong stumbled against the strong; they two fell together.[13]The word which Jehovah spake to Jeremiah the prophet, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel to come to strike the land of Egypt.[14]Announce ye in Egypt, and cause to be heard in the tower, and cause to be heard in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand, and prepare for thyself; for the sword consumed round about thee.[15]Wherefore were thy powerful cast down, not to stand? for Jehovah thrust them away.[16]He multiplied the faltering, also a man fell to his neighbor: and they will say, Arise, and we will turn back to our people, and to the land of our birth, from the face of the oppressing sword.[17]They called there, Pharaoh king of Egypt an uproar; he passed by the appointment.[18]I live, says the King, Jehovah of armies his name, For as Tabor in the mountains, and as Carmel in the sea, he shall come.[19]Make to thee instruments of captivity, thou daughter dwelling in Egypt: for Noph shall be for a waste and desolate from not being inhabited.[20]Egypt a heifer, fair of mouth; destruction came; from the north it came.[21]Also her hirelings in the midst of her as calves of the stall; for also they turned, they fled together: they stood not, for the day of their calamity came upon them, the time of their reviewing.[22]Her voice shall go as the serpent; for with an army in the sand they shall go, and with axes they came to her, as they hewing wood.[23]They cut down her forest, says Jehovah, for it shall not be searched out, for they were many above the locust, and no number to them.[24]The daughter of Egypt was ashamed; she was given into the hand of the people of the north.[25]Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, said, Behold me reviewing for the multitude of No, and upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt, and upon her gods, and upon her kings; and upon Pharaoh and upon those trusting in him:[26]And I gave them into the hand of those seeking their souls, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel, and into the hand of his servants: and after this she shall be inhabited as the days of old, says Jehovah.[27]And thou shalt not fear, O my servant Jacob, and thou shalt not be terrified, O Israel: for behold me saving thee from far off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob turned back, and rested and was quiet, and none making afraid.[28]Thou shalt not fear, O my servant Jacob, says Jehovah: for I am with thee; for I will make a completion among all nations where I thrust thee away there: and I will not make a completion with thee, and I will correct thee for judgment; and acquitting, I will not let thee go unpunished.","Jer.47":"[1]The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah the prophet, against the rovers, before Pharaoh will smite Gaza.[2]Thus said Jehovah, Behold, waters coming up from the north, and they were for an overflowing torrent, and they shall overflow the land, and its fulness; the city and those dwelling in it: and the men cried out, and all inhabiting the land wailed.[3]From the voice of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, from the bounding of his chariot, the noise of his wheels, the fathers turned not back to the sons from slackness of hands;[4]For the day came to lay waste all the rovers, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every one left of help: for Jehovah laid waste the rovers, the remnant of the island of Caphtor.[5]Baldness came upon Gaza; Ashkelon was destroyed, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?[6]Alas, thou sword of Jehovah, till when wilt thou rest? be gathered to thy sheath; be quiet and be still.[7]How shalt thou rest, and Jehovah commanded to it against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore? there he confirmed it.","Jer.48":"[1]Against Moab thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Wo to Nebo for it was laid waste: Kiriathaim was ashamed and taken: Misgab was ashamed and terrified.[2]No more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they purposed evil against it; come, and we will cut it off from a nation. Thou also shalt be destroyed, O Madmen; the sword shall go after thee.[3]A voice of a cry from Horonaim, laying waste, and great breaking.[4]Moab was broken; her youths caused a cry to be heard.[5]For the going up of Luhith weeping shall go up with weeping; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies heard a cry of breaking.[6]Flee, save your souls, and ye shall be as ruins in the desert.[7]For because of thy boasting in thy works and in thy treasures, also thou shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his chiefs together.[8]And he laying waste shall come up on every city, and no city shall escape: and the valley was destroyed, and straightness was laid waste, as said Jehovah.[9]Ye shall give a wing to Moab, that fleeing she shall go forth: for her cities shall be for a desolation, from none dwelling in them.[10]Cursed he doing the work of Jehovah slothfully, and cursed he withholding his sword from blood.[11]Moab was tranquil from his youth, and he rested upon his lees, he was not poured out from vessel to vessel, and he went not into captivity: for this his taste stood in him, and his breath was not changed.[12]For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I sent to him those turning aside, and they turned aside, and they will empty his vessels and break his bottles.[13]And Moab was ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of the house of God their confidence.[14]How shall ye say, We are mighty and men of strength for war?[15]Moab was laid waste, and she went up from her cities, and the choice of his young men went down to the slaughter, says the King, Jehovah of armies, his name.[16]The calamity of Moab drew near, to come, and his evil hastened greatly.[17]All ye about him, bewail for him; and all ye knowing his name, say, How was the strong rod broken, the beautiful shoot![18]Come down from thy glory, sit in thirst, thou daughter dwelling in Dibon; for he laying Moab waste came up upon thee, destroying thy fortress.[19]Stand to the way and look about, thou inhabiting Aroer; ask him fleeing, and her escaping, say, What was it?[20]Moab was ashamed; for she was broken down: wail, ye, and cry; announce in Arnon that Moab was laid waste,[21]And judgment came to the land of straightness; to Holon, and to Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,[22]And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon the house of cakes of figs,[23]And upon the city of forests, and upon the house of the weaned, and upon the house of habitation,[24]And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far off and near.[25]The horn of Moab was cut off, and his arm was broken, says Jehovah.[26]Make him drunk; for he was magnified against Jehovah, and Moab vomited forth in his vomit, and he was for a derision.[27]And if Israel was not a derision to thee? if he was found among thieves? for after thy speaking of him thou wilt move to and fro.[28]Those inhabiting Moab, forsook the cities and dwelt in the rock, and they were as the dove, she will nest in the regions beyond the mouth of the pit.[29]We heard the pride of Moab; he was greatly lifted up; his haughtiness and his pride, and his lifting up, and the elation of his heart.[30]I knew, says Jehovah, his wrath; and not thus; his empty talks did not so.[31]For this I will wait for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; it shall grieve for the men of Kirheres.[32]With the weeping of Jazer, I will weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy tendrils passed over the sea, even to the sea of Jazer they reached: he laying waste fell upon thy fruit harvest, and upon thy vintage.[33]And joy and gladness was taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab; and I caused wine to cease from the wine-vats: they shall not tread the shout of joy; the shout of joy, not the shout of joy.[34]From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealah, even to Jahaz, they gave their voice from Zoar even to Horonaim, a heifer of the third year: for also the waters of Nimrim shall be for desolations.[35]And I caused to cease to shout, says Jehovah, him bringing up to the height, and him burning incense to his gods.[36]For this, my heart shall sound for Moab as pipes, and my heart shall sound for the men of Kirheres as pipes: for the riches he made perished.[37]For every head bald, and every beard shaved: upon all hands cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.[38]Upon all the roof of Moab, and in the streets altogether lamentation: for I brake Moab as a vessel, no delight in it, says Jehovah.[39]How was it broken they wailed; how did Moab turn back the neck with shame and Moab was for derision and for terror to all round about him.[40]For thus said Jehovah: Behold, as an eagle he shall fly, and he spread his wings to Moab.[41]Kerioth was taken, and the fastnesses were seized, and the heart of the strong ones of Moab in that day was as the heart of a woman being distressed.[42]And Moab was destroyed from a people, for he was magnified against Jehovah.[43]Fear, and the pit and the snare upon thee, thou inhabiting Moab, says Jehovah.[44]He fleeing from the face of fear shall fall into the pit; and he coming up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, upon Moab, the years of their reviewing, says Jehovah.[45]They fleeing from the power stood in the shadow of Heshbon: for a fire will come forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall consume, the corners of Moab and the crown of the sons of noise.[46]Wo to thee, O Moab! The people of Chemosh perished: for thy sons were taken into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity.[47]And I turned back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says Jehovah. Even to this the judgment of Moab.","Jer.49":"[1]To the sons of Ammon, thus said Jehovah: Is there no sons to Israel? none inheriting to him? Wherefore did their king inherit Gad, and his people dwelt in his cities?[2]For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I caused to be heard the alarm of war to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and it was for a heap of desolation, and her daughters shall be burned with fire; and Israel shall inherit those inheriting him, says Jehovah.[3]Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai was laid waste: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro in the walled places; for their king shall go into captivity, his priests and his chiefs together.[4]Wherefore wilt thou boast in the valleys, thy valley flowing away, O daughter turning away? trusting in her treasures, Who shall come to me?[5]Behold me bringing fear upon thee, says the Lord Jehovah of armies, from all round about thee; and ye were thrust away every man to his face, and none gathering to him wandering.[6]And after this I will turn back the captivity of the sons of Ammon, says Jehovah.[7]To Edom, thus said Jehovah of armies, Is wisdom no more in Teman? did counsel perish from the discerning? was their wisdom poured out?[8]Flee ye, turn back, make deep to dwell, ye dwelling in Dedan; for I brought the calamity of Esau upon him, the time of his reviewing.[9]If the vintages came to thee will they not leave gleanings? if thieves by night, they destroyed their sufficiency.[10]For I made Esau naked, I uncovered his secret places, he shall not be able to hide: his seed was laid waste, and his brethren and his neighbors, and he is not.[11]Leave thine orphans, I will preserve alive, and thy widows shall trust upon me.[12]For thus said Jehovah: Behold, whose judgment was not to drink the cup, drinking, they will drink; and art thou he being acquitted, shalt thou be unpunished? thou shalt not be unpunished, for drinking, thou shalt drink.[13]For by myself did I swear, says Jehovah, that Bozrah shall be for a desolation, for a reproach, and for a waste, and for a curse; and all her cities shall be for wastes forever.[14]I heard a report from Jehovah, and a messenger sent to the nations: Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up for war.[15]For behold, I gave thee small among the nations, despised among men.[16]Thy terror deceived thee, the pride of thy heart, thou dwelling in the asylums of the rock, holding the height of the hill: if thou shalt make thy nest high as the eagle, from thence will I bring thee down, says Jehovah.[17]And Edom was for a desolation: all passing over her shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all her blows.[18]As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and her neighbors, said Jehovah, a man shall not dwell there, and the son of man shall not sojourn in her.[19]Behold, as the lion he shall come up from the excellency of Jordan against the habitation of strength: for I will wink, I will cause him to run from her: and who the chosen I shall appoint to her? for who like me? and who shall testify for me? and who this shepherd which shall stand before me?[20]For this, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah which he counseled against Edom: and his purposes which he purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: If not the least of the flock will drag them out: if he shall not make their habitation destitute upon them.[21]From the voice of their falling the earth trembled, at the cry its voice was heard in the sea of sedge.[22]Behold, as the eagle he shall come up and fly and spread his wings over Bozrah, and the heart of the strong of Edom was in that day as the heart of a woman being distressed.[23]To Damascus: Hamath was ashamed, and Arpad: for they heard the evil report: they melted; fear upon the sea; it will not be able to rest.[24]Damascus was relaxed, she turned back to flee, and terror laid hold of her, and pain and sorrows seized her, as she bringing forth.[25]How was the city of praise not left, the city of my joy![26]For this her young men shall fall in her street, and all the men of war shall be destroyed in that day, says Jehovah of armies.[27]And I will kindle a fire in the walls of Damascus, and it consumed the palaces of the son of Hadad.[28]To Kedar, and to the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel struck, thus said Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the sons of the east.[29]Their tents and their flocks they shall take away: their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels, shall they lift up for themselves; and they called to them, Fear from round about.[30]Flee, move yourselves greatly, make deep to dwell, ye inhabitants of Hazor, says Jehovah; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel counseled counsel against you, and purposed a purpose against you.[31]Arise, go ye up to the nation at rest, dwelling with confidence, says Jehovah; no gates and no bars to it; they shall dwell alone.[32]And their camels were for plunder, and the multitude of their cattle for a spoil: and I scattered them to every wind cut off to the corner; and from all its regions beyond I will bring their calamity, says Jehovah.[33]And Hazor was for a dwelling of jackals, a desolation even to forever: a man shall not dwell there, and the son of man shall not sojourn in it.[34]The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the kingdom of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,[35]Thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me breaking the bow of Elam the beginning of their strength.[36]And I brought upon Elam the four winds from the four ends of the heavens, and I scattered them to all these winds; and there shall not be a nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come there.[37]And I confounded Elam before their enemies, and before them seeking their soul: and I brought evil upon them, the burning of mine anger, says Jehovah; and I sent after them the sword even till I finished them.[38]And I set my throne in Elam, and I destroyed from thence the king and the chiefs, says Jehovah.[39]And it was in the last days I will turn back the captivity of Elam, says Jehovah.","Jer.50":"[1]The word that Jehovah spake against Babel, against the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.[2]Announce ye in the nations, and cause to be heard, and lift up a signal; cause to be heard, ye shall not hide: say, Babel was taken, Bel was ashamed, Merodach was broken; her images were ashamed, her blocks were broken.[3]For a nation came up from the north against her; it shall set her land for a desolation, and none shall be dwelling in her: from man and even to beast they moved, and they went.[4]In those days and in that time, says Jehovah, the sons of Israel shall come, they and the sons of Judah together, going, and they wept: they shall go and shall seek Jehovah their God.[5]To Zion shall they ask the way, thither their faces: Come ye, and we will join ourselves to Jehovah an eternal covenant; it shall not be forgotten.[6]My people were lost sheep: their shepherds caused them to wander, they turned them away in the mountains: they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their place to lie down.[7]All finding them consumed them: and their adversaries said, We shall not transgress, for they sinned against Jehovah the habitation of justice, and the hope of their fathers, Jehovah.[8]Move from the midst of Babel, and from the land of the Chaldeans; come forth and be ye as the he goats before the flock.[9]For behold I raise up and bring up against Babel a convocation of great nations from the land of the north: and they arranged against her; from thence she shall be taken: his arrow as of a strong destroyer shall not turn back in vain.[10]And Chaldea was for a spoil: all spoiling her shall be satisfied, says Jehovah.[11]Because thou wilt be glad, because thou wilt exult, ye plundering mine inheritance, because thou wilt show off proudly as a heifer at grass, and thou wilt neigh as the strong ones;[12]Your mother was greatly ashamed; she bearing you was put to shame: behold the last of the nations a desert, dryness and a sterile region.[13]From the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, and it was wholly a desolation: every one passing over Babel shall be astonished and shall hiss at all her blows.[14]Arrange yourselves against Babel round about: all ye bending the bow, cast at her, ye shall not spare to the arrow, for she sinned against Jehovah.[15]Shout against her round about: she gave her hand: her supports fell, her walls were pulled down: for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: avenge ye upon her; as she did, do ye to her.[16]Cut off him sowing from Babel, and him holding the sickle in time of harvest: from the face of the Grecian sword they shall turn a man to his people, and they shall flee a man to his land.[17]Israel a scattered sheep; the lions thrust away: first the king of Assur consumed him; and the last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel bound him fast.[18]For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me reviewing for the king of Babel, and for his land, as I reviewed to the king of Assur.[19]And I turned back Israel to his habitation, and he fed in Carmel and Bashan; and upon mount Ephraim and Gilead shall his soul be satisfied.[20]In those days and in that time, says Jehovah, he will seek the iniquity of Israel, and not any; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I shall forgive to whom I shall leave.[21]Go up against the land of double rebellion, against her, and against the inhabitants of Pekod, laying waste and destroying after them, says Jehovah; and do according to all which I commanded thee.[22]The voice of war in the land, and a great breaking.[23]How was the hammer of all the earth cut off, and it will be broken! How was Babel for a desolation among the nations![24]I laid snares for thee and also thou wert taken, O Babel, and thou knewest not: thou wert found and thou wert also taken, for thou didst contend against Jehovah.[25]Jehovah opened his treasure, and he will bring forth the vessels of his anger: for this the work to the Lord Jehovah of armies in the land of the Chaldeans.[26]Come ye against her from the extremity; open her store-houses: cast her up as heaps and exterminate her: there shall be no remnant to her.[27]Lay waste all her bullocks; come down to the slaughter: wo to them! for their day came, the time of their reviewing.[28]The voice of those fleeing and escaping out of the land of Babel, to announce in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.[29]Cause ye many to be heard against Babel: all ye bending the bow encamp against her round about; there shall be no escaping: requite her according to her work; according to all she did, do to her: for she acted proudly against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.[30]For this her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of her war shall be destroyed in that day, says Jehovah.[31]Behold me against thee, O pride, says the Lord Jehovah of armies: for thy day came, the time I reviewed thee.[32]And pride stumbled and fell, and none lifting up to it: and I kindled a fire in his cities and it shall consume all round about him.[33]Thus said Jehovah of armies: the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah being oppressed together: and all taking them captive held upon them; they refused to send them away.[34]He redeeming them is strong; Jehovah of armies, his name: pleading, he will plead their cause, so that he caused the land to rest, and caused disquiet to the inhabitants of Babel.[35]A sword upon the Chaldeans, says Jehovah, and to the inhabitants of Babel and to her chiefs, and to her wise.[36]A sword against the liars; and they were foolish: a sword against her strong ones, and they were broken.[37]A sword against his horses and against his chariots, and against all the mixture which is in her midst; and they were for women: a sword against her treasures, and they were plundered.[38]A sword upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: for it is a land of carved images, and in their terrors they will be foolish.[39]For this the inhabitans of the deserts shall dwell with the islands, and the daughters of the ostrich shall dwell in her: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; and she shall not be dwelt in even to generation and generation.[40]As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and her neighbors, says Jehovah; a man shall not dwell there, and the son of man shall not sojourn in her.[41]Behold, a people coming from the north and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.[42]They shall hold the bow and the javelin: they are fierce, and they will not pity: their voice shall sound as the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, being arranged as a man for war, against thee, O daughter of Babel.[43]The king of Babel heard their report, and his hands were relaxed: anguish seized him as the pain of her bringing forth.[44]Behold, as a lion he will come up from the excellency of Jordan to the habitation of strength: for I will wink; I will cause them to run away from her: and who the chosen I shall appoint to her? for who like me? and who shall arraign me? and who that shepherd who shall stand before me?[45]For this, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah which he counseled against Babel; and his purposes which he purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: if the last of the flock shall not drag them out: if he shall not lay waste the habitation upon them.[46]From the voice of the taking of Babel the earth was shaken, and the cry was heard among the nations.","Jer.51":"[1]Thus said Jehovah: Behold me raising up against Babel and against those dwelling in the heart of those rising up, a destroying spirit.[2]And I sent forth to Babel those scattering, and they scattered her, and they shall empty her land: for they were against her round about in the day of evil.[3]Against him bending shall he bending, bend the bow, and against him going up in his coat of mail: and ye shall not spare to her young men; exterminate all her army.[4]And the wounded fell in the land of the Chaldeans, and those being thrust through in her streets.[5]For Israel not in widowhood, and Judah from his God, from Jehovah of armies; if their land was filled with guilt because of the Holy One of Israel.[6]Flee from the midst of Babel and save ye each his soul: ye shall not be destroyed in her iniquity: for it is the time of vengeance to Jehovah; he will do to her a recompense.[7]Babel a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making all the earth drunk: the nations drank from her wine; for this the nations will be foolish.[8]Babylon fell suddenly, and she will be broken: wail ye for her; take balsam for her pain, perhaps she will be healed.[9]We healed Babel, and she was not healed: forsake ye her and we will go each to his land: for her judgment reached to the heavens, and was lifted up even to the clouds.[10]Jehovah brought forth our justice: come ye, and we will recount in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.[11]Polish the arrows; fill the quivers: Jehovah roused up the spirit of the kings of the Males: for his purpose is against Babel, to destroy her; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.[12]Lift ye up a signal against the walls of Babel, strengthen the watch, set up the watchers, prepare the ambushes: for Jehovah also purposed and also did what he spake to the inhabitants of Babel.[13]Dwelling upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end came, the measure of thy plunder.[14]Jehovah of armies sware by his soul: That if I filled thee with men as with locusts, and they struck up a shout against thee.[15]He made the earth by his power, he prepared the habitable globe by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched forth the heavens.[16]For a voice he gives a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he will bring up the clouds, from the extremity of the earth, making lightnings to the rain, and he will bring forth the wind from his treasures.[17]Every man was brutish from knowledge; every founder was ashamed from his carved image: for his founding is a falsehood, and no spirit in them.[18]They are vanity, the work of delusions: in the time of reviewing they shall perish.[19]Not as these the portions of Jacob; for he the former of all: and the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of armies his name.[20]Thou a mallet to me, a weapon of war: and I broke the nations in pieces with thee, and I destroyed kingdoms with thee;[21]And I broke in pieces with thee the horse and his rider; and I broke in pieces with thee the chariot and its charioteer;[22]And I broke in pieces with thee man and woman; and I broke in pieces with thee the old man and the boy; and I broke in pieces with thee the young man and the virgin;[23]And I broke in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and I broke in pieces with thee the husbandman and his yoke; and I broke in pieces with thee the prefects and the rulers.[24]And I recompensed to Babel and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil which they did in Zion before your eyes, says Jehovah.[25]Behold me against thee, thou destroying mountain, says Jehovah, destroying all the earth: and I stretched out my hand upon thee, and I rolled thee from the rocks, and I gave thee for a burnt mountain.[26]And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, and a stone for foundations; for thou shalt be desolations forever, says Jehovah.[27]Lift up a signal in the earth, strike ye the trumpet in the nations, consecrate the nations against her, cause ye to be heard against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint over her a satrap; bring up the horse as the bristling locust.[28]Consecrate against her the nations, with the kings of the Medes, her prefects and all her rulers, and all the land of his dominion.[29]And the earth shall shake and be wearied; for the purpose of Jehovah was set up against Babel, to set the land of Babel for a desolation from not being inhabited.[30]The strong ones of Babel ceased to fight; they dwelt in fastnesses; their strength failed; they were for women: they burned her dwellings; her bars were broken.[31]A runner shall run to meet a runner, and he announcing, to meet him announcing, to announce to the king of Babel that his city was taken from the extremity.[32]And the passages were taken, and they burnt the ropes in fire, and the men of war trembled.[33]For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: the daughter of Babel is as a threshing-floor, the time of her treading; yet a little while and the time of harvest coming to her.[34]Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel consumed us, he destroyed us, he set us an empty vessel, he swallowed us down as a dragon, he filled his belly with my delicacies, he thrust us away.[35]My violence and my remainder upon Babel, shall she dwelling in Zion say; and my blood to the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.[36]For this, thus said Jehovah: Behold me pleading thy cause, and I took vengeance with thy vengeance; and I dried up her sea, and made her fountains dry.[37]And Babel was for heaps, a habitation of jackals, an astonishment and a hissing, from none inhabiting.[38]Together as lions shall they roar: they shook themselves as the lion’s whelps.[39]In their heat I will set their drinkings, and I made them drunken so that they shall exult, and sleep an eternal sleep, and they shall not rouse up, says Jehovah.[40]I will bring them down as lambs for the slaughter, as rams with he goats.[41]How was Sheshach taken and the praise of all the earth will be seized; how was Babel for a desolation among the nations![42]The sea came up against Babel: with the multitude of rolling waves was she covered.[43]Her cities were for a desolation, a land of dryness and a sterile region, a land not a man dwells in them, and not the son of man shall pass through them.[44]And I reviewed over Bel in Babel, and brought forth his swallowing from his mouth: and the nations shall no more flow to him: also the wall of Babel fell.[45]Go ye out from her midst, my people, and save ye each his soul from the burning of the anger of Jehovah.[46]And lest your heart shall be faint and ye be afraid for the report being heard in the land; and a report came in a year, and after it in a year a report, and violence in the land, dominion against dominion.[47]For this, behold, the days coming and I reviewed upon the carved images of Babel: and all her land shall be ashamed, and all her wounded shall fall in her midst.[48]And the heavens and the earth shouted against Babel, and all which is in them: for those laying waste shall come against her from the north, says Jehovah.[49]Also Babel for the falling of the wounded of Israel, also for Babel fell the wounded of all the earth.[50]Being saved from the sword, go: ye shall not stand: remember from far off Jehovah, and Jerusalem shall come up upon your heart.[51]We were ashamed for we heard reproach: shame covered our faces, for strangers came to the holy places of the house of Jehovah.[52]For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I reviewed upon her carved images: and in all her land the wounded shall groan.[53]If Babel shall go up to the heavens, and if she shall fortify the height of her strength, from me shall they laying waste come to her, says Jehovah.[54]The voice of a cry from Babel, and a great breaking from the land of the Chaldeans:[55]For Jehovah laid Babel waste, and he destroyed from her the great voice: and the billows roared as many waters, and a noise of their voice was given.[56]For he spoiling came upon her, upon Babel, and her strong ones were taken, their bow was broken: for the God of recompenses, Jehovah requiting will requite.[57]And I made drunk her chiefs and her wise, her prefects and her rulers, and her strong ones: and they shall sleep an eternal sleep, and they shall not rise up, says the King, Jehovah of armies his name.[58]Thus said Jehovah of armies: The broad walls of Babel being demolished, shall be demolished, and her high gates shall be burnt in fire; the peoples shall labor in vain, the nations for the fire, and they shall be weary.[59]The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in his going with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babel, in the fourth year to his reigning. And Seraiah was chief of the resting place.[60]And Jeremiah will write all the evil which shall come to Babel, in one book, all these words being written against Babel.[61]And Jeremiah will say to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babel, and thou sawest, and didst read all these words,[62]And thou saidst, O Jehovah, thou spakest against this place, to cut it off, for none to be dwelling in it, to man and even to beast, for it shall be desolations forever.[63]And it was as thou finishedst to read this book, thou shalt bind upon it a stone and cast it into the midst of Phrath[64]And thou saidst, Thus shall Babel sink, and shall not rise from the face of the evil which I bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Even to this the words of Jeremiah.","Jer.52":"[1]The son of twenty and one years was Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem.

And according to these, to the second pillar and the pomegranates.[23]And the pomegranates were ninety and six a side; all the pomegranates a hundred upon the net round about.[24]And the chief of the cooks will take Seraiah the priest, the head, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three watchers of the threshold:[25]And from the city he took one eunuch who was appointed over the men of war; and seven men seeing the face of the king, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the chief of the army mustering the people of the land; and sixty men from the people of the land being found in the midst of the city.[26]And Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks, will take them, and will bring them to the king of Babel to Riblah.[27]And the king of Babel will strike them, and kill them in Riblah in the land of Hamath. And Judah will be carried into exile from his land.[28]This the people which Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and twenty and three.[29]In the eighteenth year to Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred thirty and two souls from Jerusalem:[30]In the three and twentieth year to Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five souls: all the souls four thousand and six hundred.[31]And it will be in the thirty and seventh year to the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty and fifth to the month, Evil Merodach, king of Babel, in the year of his reigning lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him forth from the house of the prison,[32]And he will speak with him good things, and he will give his throne from above to the throne of the kings which were with him in Babel,[33]And he changed the garment of his shutting up: and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.[34]And his ration a ration continually, given to him from the king of Babel, the word of a day in its days, even to the day of his death, all the days of his life.","Lam.1":"[1]How sat the city alone being many in people she was as a widow: being many among the nations, being a leader in the provinces, she became for tribute.[2]Weeping, she will weep in the night, and her tears upon her cheeks: no comfort to her from all loving her: all her friends dealt faithlessly with her, they were to her for enemies.[3]Judah was carried away captive from affliction, and from the greatness of her serving: she dwelt in the nations, she found no rest: all pursuing her overtook her between straitnesses.[4]The ways of Zion mourn from none coming to the appointment: all her gates being desolated: her priests groaning, her virgins grieved, and it is bitterness to her.[5]Her adversaries were for head, her enemies were secure; for Jehovah afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children went into captivity before the face of him pressing.[6]From the daughter of Zion all her decoration went forth: her chiefs were as rams; they found not feed, and they went without strength before him pursuing.[7]Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction and her wanderings, all her delights which were from the days of old in the falling of her people into the hand of the enemy, and none helping for her: the adversaries saw her; they laughed at her calamities.[8]Jerusalem sinned a sin; for this she was for a removing: all honoring her despised her, for they saw her nakedness: also she sighed, and she will turn away behind.[9]Her uncleanness is in her train; she remembered not her latter state; and she will come down wonderfully: none comforting for her. See, O Jehovah, my affliction: for the enemy magnified.[10]The adversary spread out his hand upon all her delights, for she saw the nations came in to her holy place, which thou didst command they shall not come in to the convocation to thee.[11]All her people sighing, seeking bread; they gave from their delights for food to turn back the soul: see, O Jehovah, and regard; for I was despised.[12]Nothing to you, all ye passing by the way? Behold, and see if there is pain as my pain, which was done to me with which Jehovah afflicted in the day of the burning of his anger.[13]From height he sent fire into my bones, and it brought them down: he spread a net for my feet, he turned me away behind: he gave me desolation, being sad all the day.[14]The yoke of my transgressions was bound by his hand: they will be woven together, they came up upon my neck: he caused my strength to fail, Jehovah gave me into the hands; I shall not be able to rise up.[15]Jehovah contemned all my mighty ones in my midst: he called an appointment upon me to break my chosen ones: Jehovah trod the wine-press to the virgin, the daughter of Judah.[16]For these I weep; mine eye, mine eye will go down with water, for he comforting turning back my soul, removed far off from me: my sons were desolations, for the enemy prevailed.[17]Zion spread forth her hands, none comforting for her: Jehovah commanded for Jacob, his adversaries round about him: Jerusalem was for uncleanness within them.[18]Jehovah he is just: for I embittered his mouth: hear now, all ye peoples, and see my pain: my virgins and my chosen ones went into captivity.[19]I called to those loving me, they deceived me: my priests and my old men expired in the city, for they sought food for them, and they will turn back their souls.[20]See, O Jehovah; for straits to me: my bowels were in a ferment; my heart turned in my midst; for embittering, I embittered: without, the sword bereaved; in the house, as death.[21]Hear, ye, for I groan: none comforting for me: all mine enemies heard my evils: they rejoiced that thou didst: thou broughtest the day thou didst call, and they shall be like me.[22]All their evil shall come before thee; and do evil to them according as thou didst evil to me for all my transgressions: for many my groanings, and any heart being sad.","Lam.2":"[1]How will Jehovah in his anger cover the daughter of Zion! he cast down from the heavens to the earth the beauty of Israel, and he remembered not the footstool of his feet in the day of his anger.[2]Jehovah swallowed up, not pitying, all the seats of Jacob: he pulled down in his wrath the fortresses of the daughter of Judah; he caused to touch to the earth: he defiled the kingdom and her chiefs.[3]He cut off in the burning of anger all the horn of Israel: he turned back his right hand from the face of the enemy, and he will consume against Jacob as a fire of flame devouring round about.[4]He bent his bow as an enemy: he set his right hand as an adversary, and be will slay all the delights of the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion: he poured his wrath as fire.[5]Jehovah was as an enemy: he swallowed up Israel, he swallowed up all her fortresses: he destroyed his fortifications, and he will multiply in the daughter of Judah sorrow and sighing.[6]And he will tear away as a garden his dwelling: he destroyed his appointment: Jehovah caused to forget the appointment in Zion, and the Sabbath, and he will despise in the wrath of his anger the king and the priest.[7]Jehovah rejected his altar, he abhorred his holy place, he shut up in the hand of the enemy the walls of her castles; they gave a voice in the house of Jehovah, as the day of the appointment.[8]Jehovah purposed to destroy the walls of the daughter of Zion: he stretched out a line, he turned not back his hand from swallowing down: and the entrenchment will mourn, and the wall; together they languished.[9]Her gates sank into the earth; he destroyed and broke her bars: her king and her chiefs among the nations: no law: also her prophets found not a vision from Jehovah.[10]They sat upon the earth; the old men of the daughter of Zion were silent; they brought up the dust upon their head: they girded on sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem brought down their head to the earth.[11]Mine eyes failed with tears, my bowels were in a ferment, my liver was poured out to the earth, upon the breaking of the daughter of my people; in the fainting of the child and suckling in the wide places of the city.[12]To their mothers will they say, Where the grain and wine? in their languishing as the wounded in the broad places of the city, in the pouring out of their soul into their mothers bosom.[13]What shall I testify for thee?

the complete splendor of joy to all the earth.[16]All thine enemies opened wide their mouth upon thee: they hissed and they will gnash the teeth: they said, We swallowed down: surely this the day we longed for; we found; we saw.[17]Jehovah did what he purposed; he completed his word which he commanded in days of old: he pulled down and he pitied not: and be will gladden the enemy over thee; he lifted up the horn of thine adversaries.[18]Their heart cried to Jehovah, O wall of the daughter of Zion, cause tears to go down as a torrent day and night thou shalt give no remission to thyself; the daughter of thine eye shall not be silent.[19]Arise, cry aloud in the night: at the head of the watches pour out thy heart as water before the face of Jehovah: lift up thy hands to him for the soul of thy young children fainting with hunger in the head of all the streets.[20]See, O Jehovah, and look to whom thou didst accomplish this Shall the women eat their fruit, the children borne upon the hands? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the holy place of Jehovah?[21]The youth and old man lay down upon the earth of the streets; my virgins and my young men fell by the sword; thou didst slay in the day of thine anger; thou didst slay, thou didst not pity.[22]Thou wilt call as the day of appointment my sojourning from round about, and in the day of the anger of Jehovah there was no escaping and surviving: those I bore upon my hands and brought up, the enemy finished.","Lam.3":"[1]I the man seeing affliction by the rod of his wrath.[2]He led me and he brought darkness and not light.[3]Surely he will turn back against me;

and their faces and their wings to these four.[9]And their wings joined every one to the other; they will not turn in their going, they will go each over against his face.[10]And the likeness of their face, the face of a man and the face of a lion, to the right, to these four: and the face of an ox from the left to these four; and the face of an eagle to these four.[11]And their faces: and their wings spread out from above; to each of the two being joined each, and two covering their bodies.[12]And they will go each over against his face; to where the spirit will be there to go, they will go; they will not turn in their going.[13]And the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance as burning coals of fire, as the appearance of flames going about between the living creatures; and a shining to the fire, and from the fire will go forth lightning.[14]And the living creatures ran and turned back as the appearance of lightning.[15]And I shall see the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, to his four faces.[16]The appearance of the wheels and their works as the appearance of topaz: and one likeness to these four: and their appearance and their works as a wheel will be in the midst of the wheel.[17]In their going they will go upon their four sides: they will not turn in their going.[18]And their backs, and the height to them, and terror to them; and their backs full of eyes round about to them four.[19]And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels will go by them: and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth the wheels will be lifted up.[20]To where the spirit will be there to go they will go, there the spirit to go; and the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.[21]In their going, they will go: and in their standing, they will stand; and in their being lifted up from the earth the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.[22]And the likeness upon the heads of the living creatures a firmament as the eye of the terrible crystal, stretched forth upon their heads from above.[23]And under the expansion their wings straight each to the other: to each, two, covering upon them, to each two covering to them their bodies.[24]And I shall hear the voice of their wings, as the voice of many waters, as the voice of the Almighty in their going, the voice of speech, as the voice of a camp: in their standing, their wings will slacken.[25]And a voice will be from above to the expansion which was over their head; in their standing their wings will slacken.[26]And from above to the expansion which was over their head as the appearance of a sapphire stone: the likeness of a throne, and over the likeness of a throne, the likeness as the appearance of a man upon it from above.[27]And I shall see as the appearance of burnished brass, as the appearance of fire within to it round about, from the appearance of his loins and above, and from the appearance of his loins to below, I saw as the appearance of fire, and a shining to it round about.[28]As the appearance of the bow which will be in the cloud in the day of rain, so the appearance of the shining round about This the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And I shall see it and I shall fall upon my face, and I shall hear the voice of him speaking.","Ezek.2":"[1]And he will say to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.[2]And the spirit will come into me as he spake to me, and he will cause me to stand upon my feet, and I shall bear him speaking to me.[3]And he will say to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to rebellious nations who rebelled against me: they and their fathers transgressed against me even to this same day.[4]And the sons hard of face and strong of heart.

not in vain spake I to do to them this evil.[11]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Strike with thy hand and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the famine and by the sword and by death.[12]He being far off, in death shall he die; and he being near shall fall by the sword; and he remaining and he being besieged shall die by famine: and I finished my wrath upon them.[13]And ye knew that I am Jehovah in their wounded being in the midst of their blocks round about their altars, upon every high hill, upon all the heads of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they gave there an odor of sweetness to all their blocks.[14]And I stretched forth my hand upon them, and I gave the land a desolation and an astonishment from the desert of Diblath, in all their dwellings: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Ezek.7":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]And thou son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end, the end came upon the four corners of the land.[3]Now the end upon thee, and I sent mine anger against thee, and I judged thee according to thy ways, and I gave upon thee all thine abominations.[4]And mine eye shall not spare upon thee, and I will not pity: for I will give thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.[5]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: An evil, one evil, behold, coming.[6]An end came, the end came: it awaked against thee; behold, it came.[7]The circle came to thee, thou inhabiting the land: the time came, the day of consternation drew near, and not the shout of joy of the mountains.[8]The time drawing near I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I completed mine anger against thee: and I judged thee according to thy ways, and I gave upon thee all thine abominations.[9]And mine eye shall not spare, and I will not pity: I will give upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations, they shall be in the midst of thee;

Lord Jehovah, thou makest a completion with the remnant of Israel.[14]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[15]Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, the men of thy kin, and all the house of Israel, wholly, which the inhabitants of Jerusalem said to them, Go ye far off from Jehovah; to us this land was given for a possession.[16]For this, say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: If I put them far off among the nations, and if I scattered them in the lands, and I will be to them for a little holy place in the lands where they went there.[17]For this, say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I gathered you from the peoples, and I collected you from the lands where ye were scattered among them, and I gave to you the land of Israel.[18]And they came there, and they took away all the abominable things, and all the abominations from thence.[19]And I gave to them one heart, and a new spirit I will give in the midst of you; and I turned away the heart of stone from their flesh, and I gave to them a heart of flesh:[20]That they shall walk in my laws, and they shall watch my judgments and do them, and they were to me for a people and I shall be to them for God.[21]And to the heart going to the heart of their abominable things and their abominations, I gave their way upon their head, says the Lord Jehovah.[22]And the cherubs will lift up their wings, and the wheels with them; and the glory of the God of Israel over them from above.[23]And the glory of Jehovah will go up from the midst of the city, and stand upon the mountain which is from the east to the city.[24]And the spirit lifted me up, and it will bring me to Chaldea to the captivity, in a vision by the spirit of God. And the vision which I saw will go up from me.[25]And I shall speak to the captivity all the words of Jehovah which he caused me to see.","Ezek.12":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, thou art dwelling in the midst of a house of contradiction, which to them eyes to see, and they saw not: ears to them to hear, and they heard not: for they are a house of contradiction.[3]And thou Son of man, make to thee vessels of captivity and emigrate by day before their eyes; and emigrating from thy place to another place before their eyes; perhaps they will see if they are a house of contradiction.[4]And bring forth thy vessels as vessels of captivity by day, before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth in the evening before their eyes, as the goings forth of captivity.[5]Before their eyes break through to thee in the wall, and bring forth by it.[6]Before their eyes upon the shoulder thou shalt lift up, in thick darkness thou shalt bring forth: thou shalt cover thy face, and thou shalt not see the earth: for I gave thee a wonder to the house of Israel.[7]And I shall do thus as I was commanded: I brought forth the vessels as vessels of captivity by day, and in the evening I broke through for me in the wall with the hand; in the thick darkness I brought forth, upon the shoulder I lifted up before their eyes.[8]And the word of Jehovah will be to me in the morning, saying,[9]Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the house of contradiction, say to thee, What doest thou?[10]Say to them, thus said the Lord Jehovah: The ruler of this burden in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel which they are in the midst of them.[11]Say, I am your wonder: as I did, so it shall be done to them: by emigrating, they shall go into captivity.[12]And the prince which is in the midst of them shall lift up upon the shoulder in thick darkness, and go forth: they shall break through into the wall to bring forth by it: he shall cover his face so that be shall not see the earth with the eye.[13]And I spread my net upon him, and he was taken in my net: and I brought him to Babel the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die.[14]And all which are round about him to help, and all his hosts, I will scatter to every wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.[15]And they shall know that I am Jehovah, in my scattering them in the nations; and I scattered them in the lands.[16]And I left of them men of number, from the sword and from famine, and from death, so that they shall recount all their abominations among the nations where they went there; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.[17]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[18]Son of man, thou shalt eat thy bread with trembling, and thou shalt drink thy water with disquiet and with dread;[19]And say to the people of the land, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to the land of Israel: they shall eat their bread with dread, and they shall drink their waters with astonishment, that her land shall be laid waste from her fulness from the violence of all dwelling in her.[20]And the cities being inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and they knew that I am Jehovah.[21]And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,[22]Son of man, what this parable to you upon the land of Israel, saying, The days will be prolonged and every vision perished?[23]For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I caused this parable to cease, and they shall no more use it for a parable in Israel; but speak to them: The days drew near, and the word of every vision.[24]For no more shall there be any vain vision and smooth divination in the midst of the house of Israel.[25]For I am Jehovah: I will speak, what word I will speak and it shall be done; it shall no more be protracted: for in your days, O house of contradiction, I will speak the word, and I did it, says the Lord Jehovah.[26]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[27]Son of man, behold the house of Israel saying, The vision which he saw is for many days, and for the times afar off he prophesied.[28]For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No more shall my words be protracted, for I will speak the word and it shall be done, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.13":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel prophesying, and say to them prophesying from their heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah.[3]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo upon the foolish prophets which are going after their spirit, and they saw not.[4]Thy prophets were as the foxes in the sterile regions, O Israel.[5]Ye went not up into the breaches, and ye will wall in the wall upon the house of Israel to stand in the war in the day of Jehovah.[6]They saw vanity and a divination of falsehood, saying, says Jehovah: and Jehovah sent them not: and they waited to raise up the word.[7]Saw ye not a vision of falsehood, and ye said, a divination of a lie, and saying, says Jehovah; and I spake not.[8]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because ye spake falsehood and saw a lie, for this, behold me against you, said the Lord Jehovah.[9]And mine hand shall be upon the prophets seeing falsehood, and divining a lie: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, and they shall not be written in the writing of the house of Israel, and to the land of Israel they shall not come in; and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.[10]Because, and because they led my people astray, saying, Peace; and no peace; and he built a wall and they plastering it with plaster:[11]Say to them plastering with plaster: And it shall fall: there was a violent rain poured out; and ye, O hailstones, shall fall; and the spirit of storms shall rend.[12]And behold, the wall fell; shall it not be said to you, Where the plastering which ye plastered?[13]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I rent a spirit of storms in my wrath; and there shall be a violent shower overflowing in mine anger, and stones of hail in my wrath to finish.[14]And I broke in pieces the wall which ye plastered with plaster, and I caused it to touch the earth, and its foundation was uncovered and it fell, and ye were consumed in its midst: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.[15]And I finished my wrath upon the wall, and upon those plastering it with plaster, and saying to you, No wall, and none plastering it;[16]The prophets of Israel prophesying to Jerusalem, and seeing for her a vision of peace, and no peace, says the Lord Jehovah.[17]And thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people prophesying from their heart, and prophesy thou against them.[18]And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to them sewing together cushions for all the joints of the hands, and making cushions upon the head of every height to lie in wait for souls! will ye lie in wait for the souls to my people, and will ye preserve alive the souls to you?[19]Ye will profane me to my people for handfuls of barley and for morsels of bread, to kill the souls which shall not die, and to preserve alive the souls which shall not live, by your falsehood to my people hearing the falsehood?[20]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against your pillows with which ye lie in wait there for the souls to break forth, and I rent them from your arms, and I sent away the souls, the souls which ye lie in wait for to break forth.[21]And I rent your cushions and I delivered my people from your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand for being laid in wait for; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.[22]Because ye afflicted the heart of the just one with falsehood, and I afflicted him not; and to strengthen the hands of the evil one not to turn back from his evil way, to preserve him alive.[23]For this, ye shall not see falsehood, and ye shall no more divine a divination: and I delivered my people from your hand: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.","Ezek.14":"[1]And there will come to me men from the old men of Israel, and sit before me.[2]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[3]Son of man, these men brought up their blocks upon their heart, and they gave the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: shall I be sought out, shall I be sought oat for them?[4]For this, speak to them and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: A man, a man of the house of Israel who shall bring up his blocks upon his heart, and shall set up the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and coming to the prophet, I Jehovah answered to him coming according to the multitude of his blocks;[5]So that taking the house of Israel in their heart, which were all of them separated from me by their blocks.[6]For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Turn ye back, and turn away from your blocks; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.[7]For a man, a man of the house of Israel, and of the stranger who shall sojourn in Israel, and he shall separate himself from after me, and shall bring up his blocks into his heart, and shall set the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and coming to the prophet to seek out to him for me; I Jehovah will answer to him for me:[8]And I gave my face against that man, and I set him for a sign and for parables, and I cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.[9]And if the prophet shall be deceived, and he spake a word, I Jehovah deceived that prophet, and I stretched forth my hand upon him, and I destroyed him from the midst of my people Israel.[10]And they bare their iniquity; as the iniquity of him seeking so shall be the iniquity of the prophet;[11]So that the house of Israel shall no more wander from after me, and they shall no more be defiled with all their transgressions; and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, says the Lord Jehovah.[12]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[13]Son of man, if a land shall sin against me to cover a transgression, and I stretched forth my hands upon it, and I broke to it the staff of bread, and sent famine upon it, and I cut off from it man and cattle:[14]And were these three men in its midst, Noah, Daniel, and Job, they by their justice shall deliver their souls, says the Lord Jehovah.[15]If I shall cause the evil beast to pass through upon the land, and it was bereaved, and there was desolation from not passing through from the face of the beast:[16]These three men in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if sons and if daughters they shall deliver; they alone shall be delivered, and the land shall be a desolation.[17]Or I shall bring a sword upon that land, and I said, Sword, thou shalt pass through the land; and I cut off from it man and cattle.[18]And these three men in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall not deliver sons and daughters, for they alone shall be delivered.[19]Or I shall send death to that land, and I poured out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and cattle.[20]And Noah, Daniel, and Job, in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if son if daughter they shall deliver; they by their justice shall deliver their soul.[21]For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Also if I sent my four evil judgments, sword and famine, and the evil beast, and death to Jerusalem, to cut off from it man and cattle?[22]And behold, there was left in it an escaping, sons and daughters being brought forth: behold them, they shall be brought forth to you, and ye saw their way and their doings: and ye were comforted concerning the evil which I brought upon Jerusalem, all which I brought upon her.[23]And they comforted you, for ye shall see their way and their doings;

the fire consumed its two ends, and the midst of it was burned. Will it succeed for work.[5]Behold, in its being whole, it will not do for work: but if the fire consumed it, and it was burnt, did it yet do for work?[6]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the tree of the vine upon the tree of the forest which I gave it to the fire for consuming, thus I gave the inhabitants of Jerusalem.[7]And I gave my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, and the fire shall consume them; and they knew that I am Jehovah in my setting my face against them.[8]And I gave the land a desolation, because they transgressed a transgression, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.16":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abomination,[3]And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity from the land of the Canaanite; thy father the Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.[4]And thy nativity, in the day thou wert born thy navel was not cut, and thou wert not washed in water for my looking upon; and salting, thou wert not salted, and swathing, thou wert not swathed.[5]No eye spared upon thee to do one of these to thee, to pity upon thee; and thou wilt be east to the face of the field in loathing of thy soul in the day of bringing thee forth.[6]And I shall pass by thee and see thee being trodden under foot in thy bloods, and saying to thee in thy bloods, Live; and saying to thee in thy bloods, Live.[7]I gave thee ten thousand as the sprout of the field, and thou shalt be multiplied and enlarged, and come into ornament of ornaments: the breasts were set, and thy hair sprang up, and thou wert naked and nakedness.[8]And I shall pass by thee and see thee, and behold, thy time the time of loves; and I shall spread my wing over thee and cover thy nakedness: and I shall swear to thee, and come into covenant with thee, says the Lord Jehovah, and thou shalt be to me.[9]And I will wash thee in water, and I will wash thy bloods from off thee, and I will cover thee with oil.[10]And I will clothe thee with variegations, and shoe thee with tahash, and I will bind thee round with fine linen, and cover thee with silk.[11]And I shall deck thee with ornaments, and I shall give bracelets upon thy hands and a chain upon thy throat.[12]And I will give a ring upon thy nose, and earrings for thine ears, and a crown of glory upon thy head.[13]And thou shalt be decked with gold and silver, and thy clothing fine linen and silk, and variegation; fine flour and honey and oil thou didst eat; and thou wilt be fair, very exceedingly, and thou wilt prosper into a kingdom.[14]And a name went forth to thee among the nations in thy beauty: for it was perfected by my decoration which I put upon thee, says the Lord Jehovah[15]And thou wilt trust in thy beauty, and commit fornication upon thy name, and thou wilt pour out thy fornications upon every one passing by; to him it will be.[16]And thou wilt take from thy garments and make to thee heights being spotted, and thou wilt commit fornication upon them: thou earnest not in, and it shall not be.[17]And thou wilt take all thy ornaments from my gold and from my silver, which I gave to thee, and thou wilt make to thee images of a male and commit fornication with them.[18]And thou wilt take thy garments of variegations and cover them: and thou gavest mine oil and mine incense before them.[19]And my bread which I gave to thee, fine flour and oil and honey I gave thee to eat, and thou didst give it before them for an odor of sweetness: and it will be, says the Lord Jehovah.[20]And thou wilt take thy sons and thy daughters which thou didst bear to me, and thou wilt sacrifice them for these to eat From thy fornication is it small?[21]And thou wilt slaughter my sons and give them in causing them to pass through for them.[22]And with all thine abominations and thy fornications thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, in thy being naked and nakedness, and thou wert trod under foot in thy blood.[23]And it will be after all thine evil, Wo, wo to thee! says the Lord Jehovah.[24]Thou wilt build to thee a brothel, and thou wilt make to thee a height in every street.[25]At every head of the way thou didst build thy height, and thou wilt cause thy beauty to be abhorred, and thou wilt open wide thy feet to every one passing by, and thou wilt multiply thy fornication.[26]And thou wilt commit fornication with the sons of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh: and thou wilt multiply thy fornications to irritate me.[27]And behold, I stretched forth my hand upon thee, and I will take away thy law, and I will give thee to the soul of those hating thee, the daughters of the rovers, being ashamed of thy way of wickedness.[28]And thou wilt commit fornication with the sons of Assur, from thy not being satisfied; and thou wilt commit fornication with them, and thou wert not satisfied.[29]And thou wilt multiply thy fornication at the land of Canaan with the Chaldeans, and also thou wert not satisfied with this,[30]How thy heart languished, says the Lord Jehovah, in thy doing all these, the work of a woman, an imperious harlot;[31]In thy building thy brothel in the head of every way, and thou madest thy height in every street; and thou wert not as a harlot to scorn a gift.[32]The wife committing adultery, instead of her husband she will take strangers.[33]To all committing fornication they will give liberal gifts: and thou gavest thy liberal gifts to all loving thee, and thou wilt make them a present to come in to thee from round about in thy fornications.[34]And it will be in thee the reverse from women in thy fornications, and none committing fornication after thee: and in thy giving liberal gifts, and none giving liberal gifts to thee; and thou wilt be for the reverse.[35]For this, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:[36]Thus said the Lord Jehovah Because thy brass was poured out, and thy nakedness will be uncovered in thy fornications to those loving thee, and to all the blocks of thine abominations, and according to the bloods of thy sons which thou gavest to them;[37]For this, behold me gathering all those loving thee whom thou wert pleasant to them, and all whom thou lovedst, with all whom thou hatedst; and I gathered them against thee from round about, and I uncovered thy nakedness to them, and they saw all thy nakedness.[38]And I judged thee with judgments of those committing adultery and pouring out blood; and I gave thee blood of wrath and jealousy.[39]And I gave thee into their hand, and they pulled down thy brothel, and they broke down thy heights, and they stripped thee of thy garments, and they took all thy glory, and they left thee naked and nakedness.[40]And they brought up a convocation against thee, and they stoned thee with stone, and they cut thee in pieces with their swords.[41]And they burnt thy houses with fire, and they did judgments upon thee before the eyes of many women: and I caused thee to cease from a harlot, and also thou shalt no more give hire.[42]And I caused my wrath against thee to rest, and my jealousy departed from thee, and I will no more be irritated.[43]Because that thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, and thou wilt disquiet me in all these; and lo, I also gave thy way upon the head, says the Lord Jehovah: and thou didst not do wickedness upon all thine abominations.[44]Behold, all using parables will use a parable against thee, saying, As the mother, the daughter.[45]Thou thy mother’s daughter loathing her husband and her sons; and thou the sister of thy sisters who loathed their husbands and their sons: your mother a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.[46]Thine elder sister, Shomeron, she and her daughter dwelling upon thy left hand: and thy sister smaller than thou, dwelling from thy right hand, Sodom and her daughters.[47]And thou wentest not in their ways, and thou didst not their abominations: loathing as a little, and thou wilt be corrupted above them in all thy ways.[48]I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if Sodom thy sister did, she and her daughters, as thou didst, thou and thy daughters.[49]Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, security of rest was to her and to her daughters, and she strengthened not the hand of the poor and needy.[50]And they will be proud, and they will do abomination before me: and I shall take them away according to what I saw.[51]And Shomeron sinned not according to half thy sins: and thou wilt multiply thine abominations above them, and thou wilt justify thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou didst.[52]And thou also bear thy shame, who didst judge for thy sisters in thy sins which thou didst make abominable above them: they shall be justified more than thou: and also thou, be thou ashamed and bear thy shame in thy justifying thy sisters.[53]And I turned back their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Shomeron and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captivities in their midst:[54]So that thou shalt bear thy shame, and thou wert made ashamed of all which thou didst in thy comforting them.[55]And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall turn back to their beginning, and Shomeron and her daughters shall turn back to their beginning, and thou and thy daughters shall turn back to your beginning.[56]And thy sister Sodom was not for a hearing in thy mouth in the day of thy pride.[57]Before thine evil shall be uncovered as the time of reproach of the daughters of Aram and all round about her, the daughters of the rovers despising thee from round about.[58]Thy wickedness and thine abominations, thou didst bear them, says Jehovah.[59]For thus said the Lord Jehovah: And doing with thee according as thou didst who despised the oath to break the covenant.[60]And I remembered my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I set up to thee an eternal covenant.[61]And thou didst remember thy ways, and thou wert ashamed in thy receiving thy sisters great above thee, to the younger than thee: and I gave them to thee for daughters, and not from thy covenant.[62]And I set up my covenant with thee, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.[63]So that thou shalt remember, and thou wert ashamed, and there shall no more be to thee an opening of the mouth from the face of thy shame in my expiating for thee for all which thou didst, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.17":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, propose an enigma and use a parable to the house of Israel;[3]And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The great eagle great of wings, long of the wing-feather, full of feathers, which to him variegation, came to Lebanon, and he will take the foliage of the cedar.[4]He plucked off the head of the suckers, and he will bring it to the land of Canaan, and he set it in a city of merchants.[5]And he will take from the seed of the land, and he will give it in a field of seed; he took it to many waters, he set it a willow.[6]And it will spring up, and it will be for a spreading vine low of stature, for its branches turning towards him, and its roots will be under him: and it will be for a vine, and it will make branches, and it will send forth foliage.[7]And there will be one great eagle, great of wings, and many feathers: and behold, this vine turned her roots to him, and sent forth her branches to him, to water it from the ascendings of its planting.[8]In a good field by many waters it was planted, to make branches to bear fruit, to be for a great vine.[9]Say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pluck up its roots, and cut off its fruit, and dry up all the fresh foliage of its springing up? It shall be dried up, and not in its great strength, and by much people to lift it up from its roots.[10]And behold, being planted, shall it prosper? as the east wind strikes upon it? drying up, shall it not be dried up? it shall be dried up upon the risings of its springing up.[11]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[12]Say now to the house of contradiction, Knew ye not what are these? Say, Behold, the king of Babel coming to Jerusalem, and he will take her king and her chiefs, and bring them to him into Babel.[13]And he will take from the seed of the kingdom and cut out with him a covenant, and he will bring him in with an oath, and he took the mighty of the land:[14]To be a low kingdom, not to be lifted up, to watch his covenant to stand to it.[15]And he will rebel against him to send his messengers to Egypt, to give to him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he doing these, escape? and breaking the covenant, and escaping?[16]I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not in the place the king making him king which he despised his oath, and which he broke his covenant with him, in the midst of Babel he shall die.[17]And not with great strength and with a great convocation, shall Pharaoh do for him in the war by throwing up a mound and by building a watchtower to cut off many souls?[18]And he despised the oath to break the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand, and doing all these he shall not escape.[19]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live, if not mine oath which he despised, and my covenant which he brake, and I gave it upon his head.[20]And I spread my net upon him and he was taken in my net, and I brought him to Babel, and I contended with him there for his transgression which he transgressed against me.[21]And all his flight with all his hosts, they shall fall by the sword, and they being left shall be dispersed to every wind: and ye knew that I Jehovah spake.[22]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I took from the foliage of the cedar, and I gave from the head; I will pluck its suckers a tender one, and I planted upon a mountain of height and heaped up.[23]In the mountain of the height of Israel I will plant it: and it bare a branch, and it made fruit, and it was for a great cedar: and there dwelt under it all fowls of every wing; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.[24]And all the trees of the field knew that I Jehovah brought low the tree of height, made high the low tree, I dried up the green tree, and I caused the dry tree to flourish: I Jehovah spake and I did.","Ezek.18":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]What to you making use of this parable upon the land of Israel, saying, The fathers will eat sour grapes and the sons teeth will be blunted?[3]I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if it shall be to you more to use this parable in Israel.[4]Behold, all souls to me; behold, as the soul of the father, and so the soul of the son, they are to me. The soul sinning, it shall die.[5]And if a man shall be just and do judgment and justice,[6]Not to eat upon the mountains, and not to lift up his eyes to the blocks of the house of Israel, and not to defile his neighbor’s wife, and he shall not come near to a woman of uncleanness.[7]And he shall not oppress a man; he shall turn back his pledge to the debtor; he will not strip off plunder, his bread he will give to him hungry, and the naked he will cover with a garment;[8]And he shall not give upon interest, and he shall not take interest, from iniquity he shall turn back his hand; he shall do judgment of truth between man to man.[9]In my laws he shall go and he watched my judgments to do the truth; he is just; living, he shall live, says the Lord Jehovah.[10]And he begat a rapacious son, pouring out blood and doing the likeness of one of these.[11]And he doing not all these, but eating upon the mountains and defiling his neighbor’s wife,[12]Oppressing the poor and needy, stripping off plunder, he will not turn back the pledge, and he lifted up his eyes to the blocks, doing abomination,[13]Giving upon interest, and taking interest: and living, he shall not live: doing all these abominations, dying, he shall die; his bloods shall be upon him.[14]And behold, he begat a son, and he will see all his father’s sins which he did, and he will see and will not do like them;[15]Not eating upon the mountains, and not lifting up his eyes to the blocks of the house of Israel, not defiling his neighbor’s wife,[16]And not oppressing a man, not binding the pledge, and not stripping off plunder, giving his bread to him hungry, and clothing the naked with a garment.[17]Turning back his hand from the poor, taking not usury and interest, doing my judgment, going in my laws; he shall not die in the iniquity of his father; living, he shall live.[18]His father because oppressing, he oppressed, stripping off, he stripped off the brother, and he did not good in the midst of my people, and behold him dying in his iniquity.[19]And ye said, Why bore not the son upon the iniquity of the father? and the son doing judgment and justice, watching all my laws, and he will do them; living, he shall live.[20]The soul sinning, it shall die. The son shall not bear for the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear for the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just one shall be upon him, and the injustice of the unjust one shall be upon him.[21]And if the unjust one shall turn back from all his sins which he did, and he watched all my laws and did judgment and justice; living, he shall live; he shall not die.[22]All his transgressions which he did shall not be remembered to him: in his justice which he did he shall live.[23]Delighting, shall I delight in the death of the unjust one? says the Lord Jehovah: not in his turning back from his way and living?[24]And in the just turning back from his justice, and doing iniquity according to all the abominations which the unjust one did, will he do and live? all his justices which he did shall not be remembered: in his transgression which he transgressed and in his sins which he sinned, in them he shall die.[25]And ye said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. Hear ye now, O house of Israel; shall not my way make even? shall not your ways make hot even?[26]In the turning back of the just one from his justice, and doing iniquity and dying in them; in his iniquity which he did he shall die.[27]And in the unjust one turning back from his injustice which he did; and he will do judgment and justice, he shall save his soul alive.[28]And he will see and turn back from all his transgressions which he did, living, he shall live; he shall not die.[29]And the house of Israel said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. Will not my ways make even, O house of Israel, shall not your way not make even?[30]For this I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah: Turn back and withdraw from all your transgressions; and iniquity shall not be to you for a stumbling block.[31]Cast away from you all your transgressions which ye transgressed against me, and make to you a new heart and a new spirit: and wherefore will ye die, O house of Israel?[32]For I shall not delight in the death of him dying, says the Lord Jehovah: and turn ye back and live.","Ezek.19":"[1]And thou, lift thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,[2]And say, What thy mother? a lioness: between lions she lay down, in the midst of young lions she brought up her whelps.[3]And she will bring up one of her whelps: it was a young lion, and it will learn to rend the prey eating man.[4]And the nations will hear concerning him; in their pit he was taken, and they will bring him with hooks to the land of Egypt.[5]And she will see that waiting her hope perished, and she will take one of her whelps setting him a young lion.[6]And he will go about in the midst of the lions; he was a young lion, and he will learn to tear in pieces the prey, eating man.[7]And he knew their palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land will be desolate and its fulness from the voice of his roaring.[8]And the nations will give against him round about from the provinces, and they will spread their net upon him, being taken in their pit.[9]And they will give him in a prison with hooks, and they will bring him to the king of Babel: they will bring him into fastnesses so that his voice shall no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.[10]Thy mother as a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and covered from much water.[11]And there will be to her rods of strength to the rods of those ruling, and his stature will be lifted up between the thick boughs, and he will be seen in his height from the multitude of his branches.[12]And she shall be plucked up in wrath, she was cast down to the earth, and the wind of the east dried up her fruit: the rods of her strength were broken and dried up, and the fire consumed them.[13]And now being planted in the desert, in a land of dryness and thirst.[14]And a fire will go forth from a rod of her branches; it consumed her fruit, and there was not in her a rod of strength, a rod to rule. It is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.","Ezek.20":"[1]And it will be in the seventh year, in the fifth, in the tenth to the month, men from the old men of Israel came to seek Jehovah, and they sat before my face.[2]And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,[3]Son of man, speak to the old men of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Come ye to seek me? I live, if I will be sought for you, says the Lord Jehovah.[4]Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:[5]And say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of my choosing upon Israel, and I will lift up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and I will be known to them in the land of Egypt, and I will lift up my hand to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;[6]In that day I lifted up my hand to them to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt to the land which I spied out for them flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands:[7]And saying to them, Cast ye away each the abominations of his eyes, an ye shall not be defiled with the blocks of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.[8]And they will rebel against me, and they would not hear to me: they cast not away each the abominations of their eyes, and they forsook not the blocks of Egypt: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them, to complete mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.[9]And I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which they were in the midst of them, which I was made known to them before their eyes to bring them forth from the land of Egypt.[10]And I shall cause, them to go forth from the land of Egypt, and I shall bring them to the desert.[11]And I shall give to them my laws, and my judgments I caused them to know, which a man shall do them and he lived in them.[12]And also my Sabbaths I gave to them to be for a sign between me and between them, to know that I am Jehovah consecrating them.[13]And the house of Israel will rebel against me fit the desert: in my laws they went not, and my judgments they rejected, which a man shall do them and he lived in them: and my Sabbaths they profaned greatly and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them in the desert to finish them.[14]And I shall do for sake of my name, that it was not polluted before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.[15]And also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, not to bring them in to the land which I gave flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands.[16]Because they rejected upon my judgments, and my laws they went not in them, and my Sabbaths they profaned: for their heart went after their blocks.[17]And mine eye will spare for them from destroying them, and I made not a completion with them in the desert.[18]And saying to their sons in the desert Ye shall not go in the laws of your fathers, and their judgments ye shall not watch, and with their blocks ye shall not be defiled.[19]I am Jehovah your God; go ye in my: laws, and watch ye my judgments and do them.[20]And consecrate my Sabbaths; and they were for a sign between me and between you to know that I am Jehovah your God.[21]And their sons will rebel against me: they went not in my laws, and my judgments they watched not to do them, which a man shall do them and live in them: my Sabbaths they profaned: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them to complete mine anger against them in the desert.[22]And I turned back my hand; and I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.[23]Also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, to scatter them in the nations, to disperse them is the lands.[24]Because they did not my judgments, and my laws they rejected, and my Sabbaths they profaned, and their eyes were after their fathers blocks.[25]And also I gave to them laws not good, and judgments they shall not live in them.[26]And I will defile them in their gifts in causing to pass through all bursting open the womb, so that I shall make them desolate, that they shall know that I am Jehovah.[27]For this, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers reviled me, in their transgressing a transgression against me.[28]And I shall bring them to the land which I lifted up my hand to give, it to them, and they will see every high hill and every thick tree, and they will sacrifice there their sacrifices, and they will give there the provocation of their oblation, and they will set there the odor of their sweetnesses, and they will pour out there their libations:[29]And saying to them, What the height where ye go there? And its name will be called Height, even to this day.[30]For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Are ye defiled in the way of your fathers? and commit ye fornication after their abominations?[31]And in lifting up your gifts, in causing your sons to pass into the fire ye are defiled for all your blocks, even to this day: and shall I be sought for you, O house of Israel? I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I will be sought by you.[32]And the things were coming up upon your spirit which will not be which ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands to serve wood and stone.[33]I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath poured out, will I reign over you.[34]And I brought you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them, with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath panted out.[35]And I brought you into the desert of the peoples, and I judged you there face to face.[36]As I contended with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so will I contend with you, says the Lord Jehovah.[37]And I caused you to pass under the rod I brought you into the bond of the covenant.[38]And I separated from you the rebellious and those transgressing against me: I will bring them forth from the land of their sojournings, and to the land of Israel they shall not come in: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.[39]And ye, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go serve ye each his blocks, and afterward if ye bear not to me and ye shall not profane my holy name yet with your gifts and with your blocks.[40]For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel serve me, all in the land: there I will receive them into favor, and there I will seek your offerings and the chief of your liftings up, with all your holy things.[41]With the odor of sweetness I will receive you into favor in my bringing you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them; and I was consecrated in you before the eyes of the nations.[42]And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my bringing you into the land of Israel, to the land which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.[43]And ye remembered there your ways, and all your works which ye were defiled in them; and ye shall be wearied in your faces for all your evils which ye did.[44]And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my doing with you for sake of my name, not according to your evil ways and your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.[45]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[46]Son of man, set thy face the way of the south, and drop to the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.[47]And say to the forest of the south, Hear thou the word of Jehovah; thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me kindling a fire in thee, and it consumed in thee every green tree and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north were burned in it.[48]And all flesh saw that I Jehovah kindled it: it shall not be quenched.[49]And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, they say to me, Does he not use parables?","Ezek.21":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, set thy face to Jerusalem, and drop to the holy places, and prophesy to the land of Israel;[3]And say to the land of Israel, Thus said Jehovah: behold me against thee, and I brought forth my sword from its sheath, and I cut off from thee the just and the unjust.[4]Because that I cut off from thee the just and the unjust, for this my sword shall go forth from its sheath against all flesh, from south to north.[5]And all flesh knew that I Jehovah brought forth my sword from its sheath: it shall no more turn back.[6]And thou son of man, sigh with the breaking of the loins; and with bitterness thou shalt sigh before their eyes.[7]And it was when they shall say to thee, For what sighest thou? and say, For the report, because it came: and every heart melted and all hands were relaxed, and every spirit was weak, and all knees shall go into water: behold, it came, and it was, says the Lord Jehovah.[8]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[9]Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said Jehovah: say, A sword, a sword was sharpened, and also polished.[10]In order to slaughter a slaughter it was sharpened; in order for lightning to be to it, it was polished; then shall we exult? the rod of my son despised, every tree.[11]And he will give it to be polished, to be taken in the hand: this sword was sharpened, and it was polished to give it into the hand of him slaying.[12]Cry and wail, son of man, for it was upon my people, it was upon all the princes of Israel: terrors for the sword were upon my people: for this, strike upon thy thigh.[13]For it is a trial, and what if also the rod was rejected? it shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.[14]And thou, son of man, prophesy, and strike hand to hand, and thou shalt double the sword the third time, the sword of the wounded: this the sword of the great wounded besieging them.[15]In order to melt the heart and to multiply the ruins, I gave the turning of the sword against all their gates: Ah! it was made for lightnings, it was polished for slaughter.[16]Unite thyself to the right, set thyself to the left, where thy face wavers.[17]And I also will strike my hand to my hand, and I caused my wrath to cease: I Jehovah spake.[18]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[19]And thou son of man, set to thee two ways for the sword of the king of Babel to come: from one land shall come forth they two, and form thou a hand, form upon the head of the way of the city.[20]Thou shalt set the way for the sword to come to Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.[21]For the king of Babel stood at the mother of the way in the head of the two ways, to divine a divination; he shook with the arrows, he asked in the family gods, he looked in the liver.[22]In his right hand was the divination of Jerusalem, to set battering-rams, to open the mouth in breaking in pieces, to lift up the voice with a loud noise, to set battering-rams against the gates, to throw up a mound, to build a watch-tower.[23]And it was to them as a divination of falsehood in their eyes, swearing an oath to them, remembering iniquity to be taken.[24]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your causing your iniquity to be remembered, in your transgressions being uncovered, for your sins to be seen in all your works; because of your causing to be remembered, ye shall be taken in hand.[25]And thou profane unjust prince of Israel, to whom his day came in the time of iniquity the end.[26]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Remove the tiara, and lift up the crown: this not thus: lift up the low, and make low the high.[27]Perverted, perverted, perverted, will I set her: and this was not till he came which to him the judgment; and I gave him.[28]And thou son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the sons of Ammon, and for their reproach; and say, The sword, the sword was loosed: for slaughter it was polished, to consume for sake of the lightning:[29]In seeing vanity to thee, in divining to thee a lie to give thee, to the necks of the wounded of the unjust, to whom their day came in the time of iniquity the end.[30]Turn back; thou shalt not be naked: in the place where thou wert created, in the land of thy nativity, will I judge thee.[31]I poured out my wrath upon thee; in fire I made mine anger to pass over thee, and I gave thee into the hand of brutish men, machinating destruction.[32]Thou shalt be to the fire for consuming; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt not be remembered: for I Jehovah spake.","Ezek.22":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the city of bloods, and make her to know all her abominations?[3]And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city poured out blood in the midst of her, for her time to come; and she made blocks for herself to be defiled.[4]In thy blood which thou didst pour out thou went guilty; and by thy blocks which thou didst make thou wert defiled; and thou wilt cause thy days to draw near, and thou wilt come even to thy years: for this, I gave thee a reproach to the nations, and a derision to all the lands.[5]Those being near and those being far off from thee will scoff at thee; thou wert defiled of name and much in consternation.[6]Behold, the princes of Israel they were a man to his arm to pour out blood in thee.[7]They made light of father and mother in thee: they did with violence to the stranger in the midst of thee: they oppressed the orphan and the widow in thee.[8]Thou didst despise my holy place, and thou didst profane my Sabbaths.[9]Men of slander were in thee to pour forth blood: and they ate upon the mountains in thee: they did wickedness in the midst of thee.[10]Thy father’s nakedness was uncovered in thee: they humbled her set apart for uncleanness in thee.[11]And a man did abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and a man defiled his daughter-in-law in wickedness; and a man humbled his sister, his father’s daughter, in thee.[12]They took a gift in thee to pour out blood; thou tookest usury and interest, and thou wilt plunder thy neighbors by violence, and thou didst forget me, says the Lord Jehovah.[13]And behold, I struck my hand at thy plunder which thou madest, and at thy blood which was in the midst of thee.[14]Will thy heart stand, or will thine hands be strong for the day which I do with thee? I Jehovah spoke, and I did.[15]And I scattered thee in the nations, and I dispersed thee in the lands, and I consumed thy uncleanness out of thee.[16]And thou didst inherit in thee before the eyes of the nations, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.[17]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[18]Son of man, the house of Israel became to me for dross: all they brass and alloy, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they were drosses of silver.[19]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: because all of them were for drosses, for this, behold me gathering you into the midst of Jerusalem.[20]The gathering silver and brass and iron and lead and alloy to the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it, to melt; so will I gather in mine anger and in my wrath, and I put down and melted you.[21]And I gathered you and blew upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye were melted in her midst.[22]As silver being melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in her midst; And ye knew that I Jehovah poured out my wrath upon you.[23]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[24]Son of man, say to her, Thou a land not being cleansed; it was not rained upon in the day of anger.[25]A conspiracy of her prophets in her midst as a roaring lion rending the prey; they consumed the soul; they will take the wealth and the precious thing; they multiplied her widows in her midst.[26]Her priests did violence to my law, and they will profane my holy place: between the holy to the profane they separated not, and they did not make known between the unclean to the clean, and from my Sabbath they hid their eyes, and I shall be profaned in the midst of them.[27]Her chiefs in her midst as wolves rending the prey, to pour out blood, to destroy souls, for the sake of plundering plunder.[28]And her prophets plastered plaster upon them, seeing vanity, and divining to them falsehood, saying Thus said the Lord Jehovah; and Jehovah spoke not.[29]The people of the land oppressed with violence and stripped off robbery, and oppressed the poor and needy, and did violence to the stranger without judgment.[30]And I sought from them a man to wall in the wall, and to stand in the breach before my face for the land, not to destroy it: and I found not.[31]I will pour out my wrath upon them; I consumed them in the fire of mine anger: I gave their way upon their head, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.23":"[1]The word of Jehovah will come to me, saying,[2]Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:[3]And they will commit fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committal fornication: there were their breasts pressed, and the breasts of their virginity fell away.[4]And their names Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister; and they will be to me, and they will bring forth sons and daughters, and their names Shomeron-Aholah and Jerusalem Aholibah.[5]And Aholah will commit fornication under me; and she will desire after those loving her, after Assur, they being near.[6]Putting on cerulean purple, prefects and governors, young men of desire all of them, horsemen riding horses.[7]And she will give her whoredoms upon them from the choice of the sons of Assur all of them, and with all whom she desired; being defiled with all their blocks.[8]And her fornications from Egypt she forsook not: for they lay with her in her youth, and they handled the breasts of her virginity, and they will pour forth her fornications upon her.[9]For this I delivered her into the hand of those loving her, into the hand of the sons of Assur whom she desired after them.[10]They uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters and slew them with the sword: and she will be a name to women, and they did judgments upon her.[11]And her sister Aholibah will see, and she will corrupt her love more than they, and her fornications more than the fornication of her sister.[12]She desired after the sons of Assur, prefects and governors, being near, putting on splendor, horsemen riding horses, young men of desire, all of them.[13]And I shall see that one way was defiled to both of them.[14]And she will add to her fornications: and she will see men delineated upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans being delineated with red color.[15]Girding girdles upon their loins, a superfluity of dippings upon their heads, the appearance of third men all of them, the likeness of the sons of Babel of Chaldea, the land of their birth.[16]And she will desire after them at the sight of her eyes, and she will send messengers to them to Chaldea.[17]And the sons of Babel will come to her to the bed of loves, and defile her with their fornications, and she will be defiled with them, and her soul will be rent away from them.[18]And she will uncover her fornications, and she will uncover her nakedness: and my soul will be rent away from her, as my soul was rent away from her sister.[19]And she will multiply her fornications, to remember the days of her youth when she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.[20]And she will desire after their paramours, whom the flesh of asses their flesh, and the flowing of horses their flowing.[21]And thou wilt review the wickedness of thy youth in the doing of Egypt thy breasts for the breasts of thy youth.[22]For this, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me raising up those loving thee, against thee, whom thy soul was rent away from them, and I brought them against thee from round about.[23]The sons of Babel and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the sons of Amur with them: young men of desire, prefects and governors, all of them third men, and celebrated, riding horses all of them.[24]And they came against thee firm with chariot and wheel, and with a convocation of peoples, shield and buckler and helmet, they will set against thee round about: and I gave judgment before them, and they judged thee with their judgments.[25]And I gave my jealousy against thee, and they did with thee in wrath: thy nose and thine ears they shall take away; and thy posterity shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be consumed in fire.[26]And they stripped thee of thy garments, and they took the instrument of thy glory.[27]And I caused thy wickedness to cease from thee, and thy fornication from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes to them, and thou shalt remember Egypt no more.[28]For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me giving thee into the hand of whom thou didst hate, into the hand of whom thy soul was rent away from them.[29]And they did with thee in hatred, and they took all thy labor, and they left thee naked and nakedness: and the nakedness of thy fornication was uncovered, and thy wickedness and thy fornications.[30]Doing these to thee for thy fornications after the nations, because thou wert defiled with their blocks.[31]Thou wentest in the way of thy sister, and I gave her cup into thine hand.[32]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: thou shalt drink thy sister’s cup deep and much: thou shalt be for laughter and for derision; containing much.[33]Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and with sorrow, the cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of thy sister Shomeron.[34]Thou didst drink it and suck out, and thou shalt crush its sherds, and pluck up thy breasts: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.[35]For this, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because thou didst forget me, and thou wilt cast me behind thy back, and also bear thou thy wickedness and thy fornications.[36]And Jehovah will say to me, Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah, and announce to them their abominations?[37]For they committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their blocks they committed adultery, and also their sons whom they brought forth to me they caused to pass through for them for consuming.[38]Yet this they did to me: they defiled my holy place in that day, and my Sabbaths they profaned.[39]And in their slaughtering their sons to their blocks, and they will come to my holy place in that day to profane it; and behold, thus they did in the midst of my house.[40]And also that ye will send to men coming from far off, whom a messenger was sent to them, and behold, they came: for whom thou didst wash, thou paintedst thine eyes, and thou didst deck with ornaments.[41]And thou wilt sit upon a splendid bed, and a table set in order before his face, and thou didst bring up there mine incense and mine oil.[42]And the voice of a multitude at rest with her: and to the men of multitude of man bringing Sabeans from the desert, and they will give bracelets upon their hands, and crowns of glory upon their heads.[43]And saying to her worn out with adulteries, Will she now commit her fornications, she also?[44]And they will go in to her as going in to a woman an harlot; thus they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the women of wickedness.[45]And just men they shall judge them with the judgment of adultresses, and with the judgment of those pouring out blood; for they are adultresses, and blood in their hands.[46]For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up upon them a convocation and give them for a shaking and for a spoil.[47]And the convocation stoned upon them with stone, and cut them down with: their swords;

and his arm they dwelt in his shadow in the midst of the nations.[18]To whom wert thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Men? and thou wert brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth underneath: in the midst of the uncircumcised thou shalt lie, with the wounded of the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.32":"[1]And it will be in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in one to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,[2]Son of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou wert like a young lion of the nations, and thou as a whale in the seas: and thou wilt break forth with thy rivers, and trouble the waters with thy feet, and thou wilt tread their rivers.[3]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: and I spread my net over thee with a convocation of many peoples; and they brought thee up in my net.[4]And I cast thee down upon the earth, upon the face of the field will I throw thee, and I caused all the birds of the heavens to sit upon thee, and I satiated from thee the beasts of all the earth.[5]And I gave thy flesh upon the mountains, and I filled the valleys with thy height.[6]And I watered the earth with thine inundation from thy blood, to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full from thee.[7]And I covered the heavens in my quenching thee, and I darkened their stars; and I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not enlighten with its light.[8]All the luminaries of light in the heavens I will darken them over thee, and I gave darkness upon thy land, says the Lord Jehovah.[9]And I irritated the heart of many peoples in my bringing thy breaking among the nations, upon lands which ye knew not.[10]And I caused many peoples to be astonished over thee, and kings shall shudder with shuddering over thee in my brandishing my sword over their faces; and they trembled at the moments each for his soul in the day of thy fall.[11]For thus said the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babel shall come into thee.[12]By the swords of the strong will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they destroyed the pride of Egypt, and all her multitude were destroyed.[13]And I destroyed all her cattle above many waters; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any more, and the hoofs of cattle shall not trouble them.[14]Then will I cause their waters to subside, and I will cause their rivers to go as oil, says the Lord Jehovah.[15]In my giving the land of Egypt a desolation, and the land was desolate from her fulness in my striking all dwelling in it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.[16]This the lamentation and the daughters of the nations lamented her: they shall lament her for Egypt, and for all her multitude they shall lament her, says the Lord Jehovah.[17]And it will be in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,[18]Son of man, Wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast it down, her, and the daughters of the powerful nations, to the earth underneath, with those going down to the pit.[19]Above whom wert thou lovely? go down, and lie with the uncircumcised.[20]In the midst of the wounded of the sword shall they fall: she was given to the sword: do ye draw her out and all her multitude.[21]The strong of the mighty shall say to him from the midst of hades with his helpers: they went down; they lay uncircumcised, wounded of the sword.[22]Assur there and all her convocation; his graves round about him: all of them wounded, fallen by the sword.[23]Whose graves were given in the thighs of the pit, and her convocation will be round about her grave; all of them wounded, fallen by the sword, who gave terror in the land of the living.[24]There Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them wounded, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the earth underneath, who gave their terror in the land of the living; and they will bear their shame with those going down to the pit.[25]In the midst of the wounded they gave a bed to her with all her multitude: her graves round about him; all of them uncircumcised, wounded of the sword: for their terror was given in the land of the living, and they shall bear their shame with those going down to the pit: he was given into the midst of the wounded.[26]There Meshech and Tubal and all dyer multitude: round about him her graves: all of them uncircumcised, wounded of the sword, for they gave their terror in the land of the living.[27]And they shall not lie with the strong fallen of the uncircumcised, who went down to hades with the weapons of their war: and they will give their swords under their heads, and their iniquities shall be upon their bones for the terror of the strong in the land of the living.[28]And thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and thou shalt lie with the wounded of the sword.[29]There Edom, her kings and all her princes who were given with their strength with the wounded of the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those going down to the pit.[30]There the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians who went down with the wounded; with their terror being ashamed of their strength; and they shall lie uncircumcised with the wounded of the sword, and bear their shame with those going down to the pit.[31]Pharaoh shall see them, and he was comforted over all her multitude wounded of the sword, Pharaoh and all his army, says the Lord Jehovah.[32]For I gave his terror in the land of the living: and he lay down in the midst of the uncircumcised with the wounded of the sword, Pharaoh and all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.33":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, speak to the sons of thy people and say to them, A land, when I shall bring the sword upon her, and the people of the land took one man from their extremities, and they gave him to them for a watchman.[3]And he saw the sword coming upon the land, and he struck upon the trumpet and warned the people;[4]And he hearing, heard the voice of the trumpet, and he took not warning; and the sword will come and take him away; his blood shall be upon his head.[5]He heard the voice of the trumpet, and he took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. He taking warning delivered his soul.[6]And if the watchman shall see the sword coming, and he struck not upon the trumpet, and the people were not warned; and the sword shall come and take a soul from them, he was taken away in his iniquity, and his blood I will seek from the watchman’s hand.[7]And thou son of man, I gave thee a watchman to the house of Israel; and thou heardest the word from my mouth, and thou didst warn them from me.[8]In my saying to the, unjust, O unjust one, dying, thou shalt die; and thou spakest not to warn the unjust from his way, that unjust one shall die in his iniquity, and I will seek his blood from thine hand.[9]And thou, if thou warnedst the unjust from his way to turn back from it, and be turned not back from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; and thou didst deliver thy soul.[10]And thou son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus ye said, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pining away in them, and how shall we live?[11]Say to them, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I shall delight in the death of the unjust; but in the turning back of the unjust one from his way, and he lived: turn back, turn back from your evil ways: and wherefore will ye die, O house of Israel?[12]And thou, son of man, say to the sons of my people, The justice of the just shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: and the injustice of the unjust, he shall not stumble in it in the day of his turning back from his injustice; and the just shall not be able to live in the day of his sinning.[13]In my saying to the just, living, he shall live; and he trusted upon his justice, and he did evil, all his justice shall not be remembered; and in his iniquity which he did he shall die in it.[14]And in my saying to the unjust, Dying, thou shalt die; and he turned back from his sinning and he did judgment and justice;[15]The unjust shall turn back the pledge he shall restore the spoil, going in the laws of the living not to do evil; living, he shall live, he shall not die.[16]All his sins which he sinned shall not be remembered to him: he did judgment and justice; living, he shall live.[17]And the sons of my people said, The way of Jehovah will not make even: and they their way shall not make even.[18]In the turning back of the just from his justice and doing iniquity, he shall die in them.[19]And in the turning back of the unjust from his injustice and doing judgment and justice upon them, he shall live.[20]And ye said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. I will judge you each according to his ways, O house of Israel.[21]And it will be in the twelfth year, in the tenth, in the fifth to the month, to our captivity, he having escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city was struck.[22]And the hand of Jehovah was to me in the evening, before he having escaped came; and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning; and he will open my mouth and I was no more dumb.[23]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[24]Son of man, they inhabiting these wastes upon the land of Israel say, saying, Abraham was one, and he will inherit the land: and we are many; the land was given to us for a possession.[25]For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Ye will eat with the bloods, and ye will lift up your eyes to your blocks, and ye will pour out blood: and shall ye possess the land?[26]Ye stood upon your sword, ye did abomination, and ye defiled each his neighbor’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?[27]Thus shalt thou say to them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live if not they who are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and he who is upon the face of the field I gave him to the beast to eat him, and they who are in the fastnesses and in caves shall die by death.[28]And I gave the land a desolation and an amazement, and I caused the pride of her strength to cease; and the mountains of Israel were desolate from none passing through.[29]And they shall know that I am Jehovah in my giving the land a desolation and an astonishment for all their abominations which they did.[30]And thou son of man, the sons of my people are speaking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speaking one to another, a man to his brother, saying, Come now and hear what the word coming forth from Jehovah.[31]And they will come to thee, according to the coming of the people, and they will sit before thee my people, and they heard thy words, and they did them not: for they making loves with their mouth, their heart went after their plunder.[32]And behold thee to them as song of loves of a fair voice, playing well an instrument: and they heard thy words and did them not.[33]And in its coming (behold, it came) and they shall know that a prophet was in the midst of them.","Ezek.34":"[1]And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, To the shepherds, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo! to the shepherds of Israel who were feeding themselves: shall not the shepherds feed the sheep?[3]Ye will eat the fat, and ye will put on the wool, ye will sacrifice the fatlings: ye will not feed the sheep.[4]Ye strengthened not the sickly, and the diseased ye healed not, and the broken ye bound not up, and the thrust away ye turned not back, and the lost ye sought not; and with force and with oppression ye ruled them.[5]And they will be scattered from Without a shepherd: and they will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field, and they will be scattered.[6]My sheep will wander upon all the mountains, and upon every high hill: and upon all the face of the earth my flock was scattered, and none searching and none seeking.[7]For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:[8]I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not my sheep were for plunder and my sheep will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field from no shepherd; and the shepherds sought not my sheep, and the shepherds will feed themselves, and my sheep they fed not.[9]For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:[10]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against the shepherds; and I sought my flock from their hand, and I caused them to cease from feeding the sheep: and the shepherds shall no more feed themselves; and I delivered my flock from their face, and they shall not be to them for consuming.[11]For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me. I also sought my sheep, and I searched them out.[12]According to the seeking of the shepherd of his flock in the day of his being in the midst of his sheep being scattered; so will I search out my sheep and deliver them from all places where they were scattered there in the day of cloud and darkness.[13]And I brought them out from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands, and I brought them to their land, and I fed them upon the mountains of Israel by the torrents, and in all the dwellings of the earth.[14]In a good pasture will I feed them, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall be their rest: there shall they lie in a good rest, and a fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel.[15]I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Jehovah.[16]The lost I will seek out, and the thrust away I will turn back, and to the broken I will bind up, and the diseased I will strengthen: and the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them with judgment.[17]And ye, my sheep, thus said the Lord Jehovah; Behold me judging between sheep to sheep, to the rams and to the he goats.[18]Is it small for you ye will feed the good pasture, and the remainder of your pastures ye will tread down with your feet? and ye will drink front the settled waters and that being left they will tread with your feet.[19]And my sheep will feed of the trodden down of your feet; and they will drink of the treading of your feet.[20]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold me I also judged between fat sheep and between lean sheep.[21]Because with side and with shoulder ye will thrust away, and with your horns ye pushed all the sickly till that ye scattered them without;[22]And I saved my sheep, and they shall no more be for plunder; and I judged between sheep to sheep.[23]And I raised up one shepherd over them, and he fed them, my servant David; he shall feed them and he shall be to them for shepherd.[24]I Jehovah will be to them for God, and my servant David a prince in the midst of them; I Jehovah spake.[25]And I cut out to them a covenant of peace, and I caused the evil beast to cease from the land: and they dwelt with confidence in the desert, and they slept in the forests.[26]And I gave them and round about my hill a blessing; and I brought down the rain in its time, and they shall be rains of blessing.[27]And the tree of the field gave its fruit, and the land shall give her produce, and they shall be upon their land with confidence, and they knew that I am Jehovah in my breaking the rods of their yoke; and I delivered them from the hand of those serving themselves in them.[28]And they shall no more be plunder to the nations, and the beast of the earth shall not eat them; and they dwelt confidently and none making afraid.[29]And I raised up to them a plant for a name, and they shall be no more taken away by famine in the land, and they shall no more bear the shame of the nations.[30]And they knew that I Jehovah their God with them, and they my people, the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.[31]And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, ye are men, I your God, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.35":"[1]And the word of the Lord will be to me, saying,[2]Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it.[3]And say to it, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O mount Seir;

For plundering a plunder didst thou call together thy convocation? to lift up silver and gold, to take cattle and substance, to spoil a great spoil?[14]For this, prophesy, O son of man, and say to Gog, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In that day in my people Israel dwelling confidently, shalt thou not know?[15]And thou earnest out of the places from the thighs of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, riding horses all of them, a great convocation and much strength:[16]And coming up upon my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the last of the days, and brought thee forth against my land, for the nations to know me in my being consecrated in thee before their eyes, O Gog.[17]Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in days of old by the hand of my servants the prophets of Israel, prophesying in those days years to bring thee against them?[18]And it was in that day, in the day Gog came upon the land of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, my wrath shall come up in my face.[19]And in my jealousy, in the fire of my wrath I spake, If not in that day shall be a great shaking upon the land of Israel.[20]And from my face shall shake the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing creeping upon the earth, and every man which is upon the face of the earth; and the mountains were overthrown, and the precipices fell, and every wall shall fall to the earth.[21]And I called to all my mountains a sword against him, says the Lord Jehovah: and the sword of each shall be against his brother.[22]And I will contend with him with death and with blood; and an overflowing rain, and hailstones, fire and sulphur will I rain upon him and upon his hosts, and upon many peoples which are with him.[23]And I magnified myself, and I consecrated myself; and I was made known to the eyes of many nations, and they knew that I am Jehovah.","Ezek.39":"[1]And thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Gog, prince of the head of Meshech and Tubal:[2]And I turned thee back, and I led thee, and I caused thee to come up from the thighs of the north, and I brought thee upon the mountains of Israel:[3]And I struck thy bow out of thy left hand, and thine arrows will I cause to fall from thy right hand.[4]Upon the mountains of Israel shalt thou fall, thou and all thy hosts, and the peoples which are with thee: to the ravenous bird, the bird of every wing, and to the beasts of the field I gave to consume.[5]Upon the face of the field thou shalt fall: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.[6]And I sent a fire upon Magog, and upon them dwelling with confidence in the islands: and they knew that I am Jehovah.[7]And I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel; and I will no more profane my holy name: and the nations shall know that am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.[8]Behold, it came, and it was, says the Lord Jehovah; this the day which I spake.[9]And they dwelling in the cities of Israel went forth and kindled and set on fire with the weapons and the shield and the buckler, with the bow and with the arrows, and with the rods of the hand and with the spear, and they burnt a fire with them seven years:[10]And they shall not lift up wood from the field, and they shall not cut down from the forests; for they shall kindle fire with the weapons, and they spoiled those spoiling them, and they plundered those plundering them, says the Lord Jehovah.[11]And it was in that day, I will give to Gog a place there, a sepulchre in Israel, the valley of those passing through east of the sea: and it stopped those passing by: and they buried there Gog, and all his multitude: and they called the valley, The Multitude.[12]And the house of Israel buried them to cleanse the land seven months.[13]And they buried all the people of the land: and it was to them for name the day of honoring me; says the Lord Jehovah.[14]And they shall separate men continually, passing through in the land burying those transported with those remaining upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: from the end of seven months they shall search.[15]And they caused to pass through, passed through in the land, and he seeing a bone of man and he built a pillar by it, they burying, buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.[16]And also the name of the city, The Multitude. And they cleansed the land.[17]And thou, son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Say to the bird of every wing and to all the beasts of the field, Gather yourselves together, and come; assemble yourselves from round about to my sacrifice which I sacrifice to you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; and ye ate flesh and drank blood.[18]The flesh of the strong shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink, rams, lambs and he goats, bullocks being fattened, of Bashan all of them.[19]And ye ate fat to satiety, and ye drank blood to drunkenness, from my sacrifice which I sacrificed for you.[20]And ye were satiated at my table with horse and chariot, with the strong, and every man of war, says the Lord Jehovah.[21]And I gave my honor among the nations, and all the nations saw my judgments which I did, and my hand that I put upon them.[22]And the house of Israel knew that I am Jehovah their God, from this day and farther.[23]And the nations shall know that for their iniquity the house of Israel were carried away captive: because they transgressed against me, and I will hide my face from them, and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall fall by the sword, all of them.[24]According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I did with them, and I will hide my face from them.[25]For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Now will I turn back the captivity of Jacob, and I compassionated all the house of Israel, and I was jealous for my holy name.[26]And they bare their shame and all their transgression which they transgressed against me, in their dwelling upon their land confidently, and none terrifying.[27]In my turning them back from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands of their enemies, and I was consecrated in them before the eyes of many nations;[28]And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God in my carrying them captive to the nations: and I collected them into their land, and I will no more leave from them there.[29]And I will no more bide my face from them, for I poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.","Ezek.40":"[1]In the twenty and fifth year to our captivity, in the beginning, of the year, in the tenth to the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck, in this very day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he will bring me there.[2]In the visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and he will set me down upon an exceeding high mountain, and upon it as the building of a city from the south.[3]And he will bring me there, and behold, a man, his appearance as the appearance of brass, and a cord of flax in his hand, and a reed of measure;

Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, it is thus:[29]Thou, O king, thy thoughts upon thy bed went up what to be after this: and he revealing secrets made known to thee what to be.[30]And I not for wisdom that is in me more than all living is this secret revealed to me, but for the reason that they shall make known the interpretation to the king, and thou shalt know the thoughts of thy heart.[31]Thou, O king, wert seeing, and behold, one great image.

and from the firmness of iron to be in it, for which cause that thou sawest iron mingled with earthen-ware.[42]And the toes of the feet, part of iron, and part of burnt clay, from the end of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be cut asunder.[43]That thou sawest the iron mingled with the earthen-ware, mingling for themselves with the seed of men: and not cleaving to them this with this, so as iron not mingling with burnt clay.[44]And in their days that they are kings, the God of the heavens shall set up a kingdom that shall not be destroyed forever: and its kingdom shall be left to another people; it shall beat small and destroy all these kingdoms, and this shall stand forever.[45]Because that thou sawest that the stone being cut from the rock not with hands, and it beat small the iron, the brass, the burnt clay, the silver and the gold: the great God made known to the king what to be after this: and the dream certain, and its interpretation faithful.[46]At that time king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and prostrated himself to Daniel, and said to pour out a gift and sweet odors to him.[47]And the king answered to Daniel, and said, of a truth that your God he is God of gods, and Lord of kings, and revealing secrets, that thou wert able to reveal this secret.[48]Then the king multiplied to Daniel, and gave to him many a great gift, and gave him power over all the province of Babel, and chief of the prefects over all the wise of Babel.[49]And Daniel sought from the king, and he appointed out over the business of the province of Babel to Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego: and Daniel in the gate of the king.","Dan.3":"[1]Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold;

Then they brought these men before the king.[14]Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, Is it on purpose O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed Nego, ye not serving to my gods, and to the image of gold that I set up, ye not prostrating yourselves?[15]Now if ye being prepared that in the time that ye shall hear the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery, and the bagpipe, and all sorts of music, ye shall fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made; and if ye shall not prostrate yourselves in the same moment, ye shall be cast into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire; and who that God that shall deliver you from my hands?[16]Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego answered, and saying to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we need not to turn back to thee upon this word.[17]If it is, our God whom we served will be able to deliver us from the furnace of flaming fire, and from thy hand, O king, he will deliver us.[18]And if not, it shall be made known to thee, O king, that to thy gods we serve not, and to the image of gold that thou didst set up we will not prostrate ourselves:[19]In that time Nebuchadnezzar being filled with wrath, and the form of the visage was changed to him against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego: he answered and said to heat to the furnace one seven times above that it was seen to be heated.[20]To the strong, the strong of strength that were in his army, he said to bind to Shadrach, Mesbach, and Abed-Nego, to cast into the furnace of flaming fire.[21]Then these men were bound in their wide trowsers, their tunics, and their mantles, and their clothing, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire.[22]For this cause, as the word of the king being severe, and the furnace exceedingly heated, these men that took up to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, the flame of fire killed them.[23]And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire, bound.[24]At that time Nebuchadnezzar the king was grieved, and rose up in haste; he answered and said to the counselors, Did we not cast three men into the midst of the fire, bound? They answering and saying to the king, True, O king.[25]He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose going about in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt in them: and the aspect of the fourth like to the Son of God.[26]At that time Nebuchadnezzar drew near to the door of the furnace of flaming fire; he answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, ye servants of God most high, go forth, and come. Then came forth Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, from the midst of the fire.[27]And there being gathered together the satraps, the prefects, and governors, and the king’s counselors, looking upon these men that upon their bodies the fire had no power, and a hair of their head was not singed, and their wide trowsers were not changed, and the smell of fire passed not upon them.[28]Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, Blessed be their God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent his messenger and delivered for his servants that trusted upon him, and they changed the king’s word, and gave their bodies that they will not serve and prostrate themselves to any god, except to their God.[29]And an edict being set from me, That every people, nation and tongue, that shall say an error against their God, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, shall be made pieces, and his house shall be set a dung-hill, because that there is no other God that shall be able to deliver according to this.[30]Then the king caused to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, to prosper in the province of Babel.","Dan.4":"[1]Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations and tongues, that dwell in all the earth, your peace shall become great.[2]The signs and wonders that the most high God made with me, it was pleasant before me to show.[3]His signs, how many! and his wonders, how mighty! his kingdom, an eternal kingdom, and his dominion with generation and generation.[4]I Nebuchadnezzar, was secure in my house, and green in my temple:[5]I saw a dream, and it will terrify me; and the conceptions upon my bed and the visions of my head, will cause me to tremble.[6]And an edict being set from me to bring up before me to all the wise of Babel, that they shall make known to me the interpretation of the dream.[7]At that time the sacred scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners, coming in: and I told the dream before them: and its interpretation they making not known to me.[8]And even at last Daniel came up before me, whose name Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods in him: and before him I told the dream:[9]O Belteshazzar, leader of the sacred scribes, for I knew that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and my secret pressed not upon thee; the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation, say thou.[10]And the visions of my head upon my bed; I was seeing, and lo, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height great.[11]And the tree increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to the end of all the earth:[12]Its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it: and the beasts of the open field will be shaded under it, the buds of the heavens will dwell in its boughs, and all flesh will be nourished from it.[13]I was seeing in the visions of my head upon my bed, and lo, a watcher and holy one came down from the heavens;[14]He called with strength, and thus he said, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit: the beasts shall flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.[15]But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the open field; and in the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and its portion with the beasts in the green herb of the earth.[16]Its heart shall be changed from man, and the heart of a beast shall be given to it; and seven times shall pass over him.[17]The word by the decree of the watchers, and the saying of the holy ones is the question: for the reason that the living shall know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it, and he will raise up over it the low of men.[18]This dream, I king Nebuchadnezzar saw. And thou Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, because that all the wise of my kingdom not being able to make known to me the interpretation: and thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.[19]Then Daniel, his name Belteshazzar, was astonished for one moment, and his thoughts terrified him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, the dream and its interpretation shall not terrify thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream to those hating thee, and its interpretation to thine enemies.[20]The tree that thou sawest that increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to all the earth,[21]And its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it; under it the beast of the open field will dwell, and in its branches the birds of the heavens will dwell:[22]It is thou, O king, who increased and wert strong: and thy greatness increased and reached to the heavens, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.[23]And that the king saw a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens, and said, Hew down the tree and destroy it; but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the open field; and with the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and with the beasts of the open field its portion, even till seven times shall pass over him;[24]This the interpretation, O king, and this the decree of the Most High, that came upon my lord the king:[25]And for thee driving from men, and with the beasts of the open field to be thy dwelling, and they shall feed to thee grass as oxen, and wetting to thee from the dew of the heavens, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it.[26]And that they said to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom being sure to thee, from when thou shalt know that the heavens rule.[27]Wherefore, O king, my counsel shall be pleasant to thee, and break off thy sins by justice, and thine iniquities in compassionating the poor; if it shall be a lengthening to thy peace.[28]All came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.[29]At the end of twelve months in the temple of the kingdom of Babel, he was going about.[30]The king answered and said, Is not this great Babel, that I built it for the house of the kingdom by the strength of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?[31]Yet the word in the king’s mouth, a voice from the heavens fell to thee, being said, O Nebuchadnezzar the king, the kingdom passed away from thee:[32]And from men driving thee out, and with beasts of the open field thy dwelling: and they shall feed to thee the grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom he will, he will give it.[33]In the same moment the word was added upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven out from men, and he shall eat the green herb as oxen, and from the dew of the heavens his body shall be wet till that his hair was increased as eagles, and his nails as birds’.[34]And at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes to the heavens, and my knowledge will turn back to me, and I praised to the Most High, and to him living forever, I praised and honored, whose dominion an eternal dominion, and his kingdom with generation and generation.[35]And all the generations of the earth being reckoned as nothing: and doing according to his station in the army of the heavens, and the generations of the earth: and there is none that shall strike upon his hand, and say to him, What didst thou?[36]In that time my knowledge will turn back to me: and for the honor of my kingdom, my splendor and my brightness will return to me; and my counselors and my nobles will seek to me: and I was established over my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.[37]Now I Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor to the king of the heavens, that all his works are truth, and his paths judgment: and that they going about in pride, he being able to bring low.","Dan.5":"[1]Belshazzar the king made great food for a thousand of his nobles, and before the thousand he drank wine.[2]Belshazzar said, in tasting the wine, to bring in for the vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father brought forth from the temple that was in Jerusalem; and in them the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, will drink.[3]At that time they brought the vessels of gold that were brought forth from the temple of the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and in them they drank, the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines.[4]They drank wine, and praised to the gods of gold and silver, brass, iron, wood and stone.[5]In the same moment went forth fingers of a man’s hand and wrote before the candlestick upon the lime of the wall of the temple of the king: and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote.[6]The king’s brightnesses changing, and his thoughts will terrify him, and the knots of his loins breaking forth, and his knees knocked this upon that.[7]The king called with strength to bring up the enchanters, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king answered and said to the wise of Babel, Whatever man that shall read this writing, and will show to me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and a necklace of gold upon his neck, and shall rule the third in the kingdom.[8]Then came in all the king’s wise ones: and they were not able to read the writing, and to make known the interpretation to the king.[9]Then king Belshazzar being greatly terrified, and his brightnesses being changed upon him, and his nobles being perplexed.[10]The queen, on account of the king’s words and his nobles’, came in to the house of drinking: the queen answered and said, O king, live forever: thy thought shall not terrify thee, and thy brightnesses shall not be changed:[11]There is a man in thy kingdom that the spirit of the holy gods in him; and in the days of thy father, his light and his understanding and wisdom according to the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king thy father, set him up leader of the sacred scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, the diviners:[12]Because that an excellent spirit and knowledge, and his understanding interpreting dreams, and showing of enigmas, and solving knotty questions, was found in him, in Daniel whom the king set his name Belteshazzar: now Daniel shall be called, and he will show the interpretation.[13]At that time Daniel came in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, Is it thou, Daniel, which is from the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah?[14]I heard concerning thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and his light and his understanding and excellent wisdom was found in thee.[15]And now the wise ones, the enchanters, were brought in before me that they shall read this writing, and to make known to me its interpretation: and they were not able to show the interpretation of the word:[16]And I heard concerning thee, that thou wilt be able to interpret interpretations, and solve knotty questions: now if thou shalt be able to read the writing, and to make known to me its interpretation, thou shalt be clothed in purple, and a necklace of gold upon thy neck, and thou shalt rule the third in the kingdom.[17]At that time Daniel answered and said before the king, Thy gifts to be to thyself, and give thy presents to another; but I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.[18]Thou, O king, God most high gave a kingdom and greatness and honor and splendor to Nebuchadnezzar thy father:[19]And from the greatness that he gave to him, all peoples, nations and tongues, were trembling and fearing from before him: whom he was willing he killed; and whom he was willing, he was saving alive; and whom be was willing, he was setting up; and whom he willed he was humbling.[20]And when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was strong for pride, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom, and they took away his honor from him.[21]And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made level with the beasts, and with wild asses his dwelling: they will feed him with the green herb as oxen, and from the dew of the heavens his body will be wet; till that he knew that God the Most High ruled in the kingdom of men, and to whom he will, he will set up over it.[22]And thou his son, O Belshazzar, didst not humble thy heart because that thou knewest all this;[23]And against the Lord of the heavens thou didst lift up thyself; and for the vessels of his house they brought before thee, and thou and thy nobles, and thy wives, and thy concubines, drinking wine in them; and to the gods of silver and gold, brass, iron, wood, and stone, who see not, and hear not, and know not, thou didst praise: and to the God whom thy breath in his hand, and all thy ways to him, thou didst not honor.[24]At that time from before him was sent the palm of the hand, and this writing written.[25]And this the writing that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PHARSIN.[26]This the interpretation of the word: Mene; God numbered thy kingdom and completed it.[27]Tekel; Thou shalt be weighed in the balances and be found wanting.[28]Pharsin; Thy kingdom was divided, and it shall be given to the Medes and to Persia.[29]At that time Belshazzar said, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and a necklace of gold upon his neck, and they cried out concerning him, for him to rule the third in the kingdom.[30]In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans was killed.[31]And Darius the Median received the kingdom, as the son of two and sixty years.","Dan.6":"[1]It pleased before Darius and he set up over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, whom to be over all the kingdom;[2]And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was one: that to them the satraps giving to them account, and the king not for him detriment.[3]Then this Daniel excelling above the presidents and satraps because that an excellent spirit was in him; and the king doing to set him up over all the kingdom.[4]Then the presidents and satraps were seeking to find a pretext against Daniel from the part of the kingdom; and they will not be able to find any pretext and corruption, because that he was faithful, and any error and corruption was not found upon him.[5]Then these men saying that, We shall not find against this Daniel any pretext except we shall find against him in the law of his God.[6]Then these presidents and satraps ran together with tumult to the king, and saying thus to him, O Darius the king, live thou forever.[7]All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and satraps, and counselors and governors, will counsel together to set up a statute of the kingdom, and to make strong an interdict that whoever shall seek a request from any God and man even to thirty days, except from thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.[8]Now, O king, wilt thou set up the interdict, and sign the writing, that not to be changed according to the law of Media and Persia, which shall not pass away.[9]For this cause, king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.[10]And Daniel as soon as he knew that the writing was signed, went up into his house; and the windows being opened to him in his upper chambers before Jerusalem, three times in the day he kneeled upon his knees, and praying and praising before his God, for the cause that he did from before this.[11]Then these men ran together with tumult and found Daniel seeking and making supplication before his God.[12]At that time they drew near, and saying before the king concerning the interdict of the king, Didst thou not sign an interdict that every man that shall seek from any God and man even for thirty days, except from thee, O King, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The word is certain, according to the law of Media and Persia, that shall not pass away.[13]At that time they answered, and saying before the king, That Daniel that is from the sons of the captivity of Judah set not up an account to thee, O king, and to the interdict that thou didst sign; and three times in the day he sought his requests.[14]Then the king as soon as he heard the word, was greatly displeased with himself, and upon Daniel he set the heart to set him free: and even to the going down of the sun he was exerting himself to deliver him.[15]At that time these men ran together with tumult to the king, and saying to the king, Know, O king, that the law to Media and Persia is, that every interdict and statute that the king shall set up is not to be changed.[16]At that time the king said, and they brought Daniel and cast into the den of the lions; the king answered and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest to him continually, he will set thee free.[17]And one stone was brought and set upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his signet ring, and with the signet ring of his nobles, that the will shall not be changed upon Daniel.[18]Then the king departed to his temple and passed the night fasting: and he brought not his concubines before him, and his sleep fled from him.[19]At that time the king will rise in the dawn in the morning, and in haste he departed to the lion’s den.[20]And in his drawing near to the den he cried to Daniel with a strong voice, the king answered and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, thy God whom thou servest to him continually, is he able to set thee free from the lion’s den?[21]Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.[22]My God sent his messenger and shut the mouth of the lions, and they hurt me not, for the cause that innocence was found to me; and also before thee, O king, I did no hurt.[23]At that time the king rejoiced greatly for him, and to Daniel he said to be taken up from the den. And Daniel was taken up from the den, and any hurt was not found upon him, for he trusted in his God.[24]And the king said, and they brought these men that ate up Daniel piece meal, and cast into the lion’s den, them, their sons, and their wives; and they not down to the bottom of the den even till the lions had power over them, and they broke all their bones in pieces.[25]At that time Darius the king wrote all peoples, nations and tongues, that are dwelling in all the earth, Your peace shall be great.[26]From before me a decree was set forth that in every dominion of my kingdom to be trembling and fearing from before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and standing forever, and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed, and his dominion even to the end.[27]Setting free and delivering, and working signs and wonders in the heavens and upon the earth, that set free to Daniel from the hand of the lions.[28]And this Daniel was prospered in the kingdom of Darius, and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.","Dan.7":"[1]In one year to Belshazzar the king of Babel, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: at that time he wrote the dream, telling the head of the words.[2]Daniel answered and said, I was seeing in my vision by night, and lo, the four winds of the heavens rushing forth to the great sea.[3]And four great beasts went up from the sea, different this from this.[4]The first as a lion, and the wings of an eagle to it; I was seeing even till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and upon its feet it was caused to stand as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.[5]And lo, another beast, a second being like to a bear; and it rose up to one side, and three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and saying to it thus, Arise, eat much flesh.[6]After this I was seeing, and lo, another, as a panther, and to it four wings of a bird upon its back, and four heads to the beast; and dominion was given to it.[7]After this I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, fearful, and strong and powerful exceedingly; and great teeth of iron to it, eating and beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet: and it being different from all the beasts that were before it; and ten horns to it.[8]I was considering upon the horns, and lo, another little horn went up among them, and three from the first horns were plucked up from before it: and lo, eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.[9]I was seeing even till thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days sat, his garment white as snow, and the hair of his head as pure wool: his throne a flame of fire, his wheels a burning fire.[10]A river of fire flowed and went out from before him: thousands of thousands will wait upon him, and myriads of myriads will stand before him: the tribunal sat, and the books were opened.[11]I was seeing at that time from the voice of the great words that the horn was speaking: I was seeing even till that the beast was killed and its body destroyed, and it was given to the burning fire.[12]And the rest of the beasts they took away their power: and length in life was given to them for a season and time.[13]I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, with the clouds of the heavens as the Son of man he came, and turning even to the Ancient of days; and they brought him near before him.[14]And to him was given dominion, power and honor, and a kingdom; and all peoples and nations and tongues shall serve to him: his power an eternal power that shall not pass away, and his kingdom which shall not be destroyed.[15]I Daniel was grieved in the midst of the sheath, and the visions of my heart will terrify me.[16]I drew near to one of those standing by, and I sought from him the truth concerning all this: and he said to me, and he will cause me to know the interpretation of the words.[17]Those great beasts that they are four, four kings they shall rise up from the earth.[18]And the holy ones of the Most High shall take the kingdom and shall possess the kingdom even to forever, and even to forever of forever.[19]Then I willed to speak the truth concerning the fourth beast that was different from all of them, exceedingly fearful, its teeth of iron and its hoofs of brass; eating, beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet;[20]And concerning the ten horns that were upon its head, and the other that went up, and three fell from before it; and this horn and eyes to it, and a mouth speaking great things, and its sight great above its companions.[21]I was seeing, and this horn made an encounter with the holy ones, and prevailed against them;[22]Even till that the Ancient of days came, and the judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High; and the time extending and the holy ones possessed the kingdom.[23]Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom in the earth, that shall be different from all kingdoms, and shall eat up all the earth, and shall tread it down and beat it.[24]And the ten horns from this kingdom, ten kings shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be different from the first, and he shall humble three kings.[25]And he shall speak words against the Most High, and he shall vex the holy ones of the Most High, and he will hope to change times and law: and they shall be given into his hand even to a time and times, and the dividing of time.[26]And the tribunal sat, and they shall take away his power to cut off and to destroy even to the end.[27]And the kingdom and the power, and the greatness of the kingdom under All the heavens was given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High his kingdom an eternal kingdom, and all powers shall serve to him, and shall hear.[28]Even to this the end of the word. I Daniel, my thoughts will greatly terrify me, and my brightness will be changed upon me: and I kept the word in my heart.","Dan.8":"[1]In the third year to the kingdom of Belshazzar the king a vision was seen to me, I Daniel, after that being seen to me in the beginning.[2]And I shall see in a vision; and it will be in my seeing, and I in Shushan the fortress, in Elam the province; and I shall see in a vision, and I was by the stream of strength.[3]And I shall lift up mine eyes, and I shall see, and behold, one ram stood before the stream, and horns to him: and the horns high; and the one high above the second, and the high came up at the last.[4]And I saw the ram pushing the sea, and north and south; and all the beasts will not stand before him, and none delivering from his hand; and he did according to his will, and increased.[5]And I was considering, and behold, a he goat of the goats came from the west upon the face of all the earth, and not touching upon the earth: and the he goat a horn of vision between his eyes.[6]And ha will come even to the ram possessing the horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and he will run against him in the wrath of his power.[7]And I saw him coming near to the ram, and he will be exasperated against him, and he will strike the ram and break his two horns: and there will be no power in the ram to stand before him, and he will cast him to the earth, and will tread upon him: and there was none delivering for the ram out of his hand.[8]And the he goat of the goats increased even greatly: and in his being strong the great horn was broken; and there will come up the vision of four underneath it to the four winds of the heavens.[9]And from one of them came forth one horn of a little thing, and it will be great exceedingly to the south to the sunrisings, and to the glories.[10]And it will be great even to the army of the heavens; and it will cast to the earth from the army, and from the stars, and it will tread them down.[11]And even to the chief of the army was he magnified, and from him the continuance was lifted up, and the foundation of his holy place was cast down.[12]And an army will be given upon the continuance by transgression, and it will cast down truth to the earth; and it did and it succeeded.[13]And I shall hear one holy one speaking, and one holy one will say to a certain one, speaking, How long the vision of the continuance, and the transgression laying waste, to be? and the holy place and the army being trodden down?[14]And he will say to me, Even to evening morning, two thousand and three hundred; and the holy place was justified.[15]And it will be in my seeing, I Daniel, the vision, and I shall seek its understanding, and behold, there stood before me as the sight of a man,[16]And I shall hear man’s voice between Ulai, and he will call and say, Man of God, cause to this to understand the sight.[17]And he will come near my standing: and in his coming I was afraid, and I shall fall upon my face; and he will say to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end, the vision.[18]And in his speaking with me I lay in a deep sleep upon my face upon the earth: and he will touch upon me and will cause me to stand upon my standing.[19]And he will say, Behold me making known to thee what shall be in the last part of the wrath: for at the appointment, the end.[20]The ram which thou sawest possessing horns, the kings of Media and Persia.[21]And the hairy he goat, the king of Grecia: and the great horn which is between his eyes, he the first king.[22]And that being broken, and four will stand up underneath it, four kingdoms from the nation shall stand up, and not in his power.[23]And in the latter state of their kingdom as those transgressing being completed, a king strong of face and understanding enigmas, shall stand up.[24]And strong his power, and not in his power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and he prospered, and did, and he destroyed the strong ones and the holy people.[25]And by his intelligence and he caused deceit to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify in his heart, and in security he shall destroy many: and against the Chief of chiefs he shall stand; and without hand shall he be broken.[26]And the sight of the evening and the morning which was said, it is truth: and shut thou up the vision; for, for many days.[27]And I Daniel was, and was sick days; and I shall rise and do the works of the king; and I shall be astonished at the sight, and none understanding.","Dan.9":"[1]In one year to Darius son of Ahasuerus, from the seed of Media who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans.[2]In one year to the kingdom, I Daniel understood by books the number of years which the word of Jehovah was to Jeremiah the prophet, to fill up for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years.[3]And I will give my face to Jehovah God to seek prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes:[4]And I will pray to Jehovah my God, and I will confess and say, Ah, Jehovah, the great and dreadful God, watching the covenant and the mercy to those loving him, and to those watching his commands:[5]We sinned, and we did iniquity, and were evil, and rebelled, and departing from thy commands and from thy judgments.[6]And we heard not to thy servants the prophets who spake in thy name to our kings and our chiefs and our fathers, and to all the people of the earth.[7]To thee, O Jehovah, justice, and to us shame of face, as this day to the men of Judah, and to those dwelling in Jerusalem, and to all Israel being near and being far off, in all the lands where thou didst thrust them there in their transgression which they transgressed against thee.[8]O Jehovah, to us shame of face, to our kings, to our chiefs, and to our fathers, that we sinned against thee.[9]To Jehovah our God compassion and forgivenesses, for we rebelled against him.[10]We heard not to the voice of Jehovah our God to go in his laws which he gave before us in the hand of his servants the prophets.[11]And all Israel passed by thy Laws, and departing not to hear to thy voice; and the curse will be poured upon us, and the oath which was written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we sinned against him.[12]And he will set up his words which he spake against us, and against our judges who judged us to bring against us a great evil: which was not done under all the heavens according to what was done in Jerusalem.[13]As that written in the law of Moses all this evil came upon us, and we supplicated not the face of Jehovah our God to turn back from our iniquities and to understand in thy truth.[14]And Jehovah will watch for evil, and will bring it upon us: for Jehovah our God is just upon all his works which he did: and we heard not to his voice.[15]And now, O Jehovah our God, who brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and thou wilt make to thee a name as this day; we sinned, we did evil.[16]O Jehovah, according to all thy justice, now shall thine anger be turned back, and thy wrath from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people for a reproach to all those round about us.[17]And now, O our God, hear to the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy desolated holy place, for sake of Jehovah.[18]Incline, O my God, thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and see our desolations, and the city which thy name was called upon it: for not for our justice do we cause our supplications to fall before thee, but for thy many compassions.[19]O Jehovah hear; O Jehovah forgive; O Jehovah, attend and do; thou wilt not delay for thy sake, O my God: for thy name was called upon thy city and upon thy people.[20]And I yet speaking and praying and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people Israel, and causing my supplication to fall before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;[21]And I yet speaking in prayer, and the man Gabriel, whom I saw in the vision in the beginning, being wearied with weariness, touched upon me about the time of the evening gift.[22]And he will cause to understand, and will speak with me, and say, O Daniel, now came I forth to teach thee understanding.[23]In the beginning of thy supplications the word came forth, and I came to announce; for thou art desires: and understand thou in the word, and consider in the sight.[24]Seventy seventy were divided upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to expiate iniquity, and to bring in eternal justice, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies.[25]And thou shalt know and understand, from the going forth of the word to turn back and to build Jerusalem even to Messiah the leader, seventy weeks, and sixty and two weeks: and the street shall turn back and be built, and the ditch, in the trouble of the times.[26]And after sixty and two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, and not for him: and the people of the leader coming shall destroy the city and the holy place; and its end with an overflowing, and even to the end of the war desolations were determined.[27]And he made strong the covenant to many one week: and half the week he shall cause the sacrifice and gift to cease, and upon the wing of abominations laying waste, even to the completion, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolation.","Dan.10":"[1]In the third year to Cyrus king of Persia the word was revealed to Daniel, whom his name was called Belteshazzar;

And in his speaking with me this word I stood trembling.[12]And he will say to me, Thou shalt not fear, Daniel: for from the first day that thou gavest thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I came for thy words.[13]And the chief of the kingdom of Persia stood against me twenty and one days: and behold, Michael, one of the first chiefs, came, to help me; and I was left there near the kings of Persia.[14]And I came to cause thee to understand what shall happen to thy people in the last of the days: for yet the vision for days.[15]And in his speaking with me according to these words I gave my face to the earth, and I was dumb.[16]And behold, as the likeness of the sons of man touched upon my lips: and I shall open my mouth and speak and say to him standing before me, O my lord, by the sight my straights were turned upon me, and I retained not strength.[17]And how shall this servant of my lord be able to speak with this my lord and I, from this time no strength will stand in me, and breath was not left in me.[18]And there will add and will touch upon me as the sight of man, and he will strengthen me.[19]And he will say, Thou shalt not fear, O man of desires: peace to thee; be strong, and be strong. And in his speaking with me I was strengthened, and saying, My lord shall speak; for thou didst strengthen me.[20]And he will say, Knewest thou wherefore I came to thee? and now I will turn back to war with the chief of Persia: and I shall go forth, and behold, the chief of Grecia coming.[21]But I will announce to thee that recorded in the writing of truth: and not one strengthening himself with me upon these things but Michael your chief.","Dan.11":"[1]And I in the one year to Darius the Mede, standing to make firm and to strengthen for him.[2]And now I will announce the truth to thee. Behold, yet three kings standing up to Persia; and the fourth shall be rich of great riches above all: and in his becoming strong in his riches he shall rouse up all against the kingdoms of Grecia.[3]And a strong king stood up, and he ruled from much dominion, and he did according to his will.[4]And in his standing up his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided to the four winds of the heavens; and not to his latter state, and not according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, and for others from besides these.[5]And the king of the south shall be strong, and from his chiefs; and he shall be strong above him, and he ruled from much dominion.[6]And at the end of years they shall join themselves together, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make straightnesses: and she shall not retain the power of the arm, and he shall not stand, and his arm: and she shall be given up, and those bringing her, and he begetting her, and he strengthening her in the times.[7]And there stood up from the shoot of her roots as he, and he shall come to the strength, and he shall come into the fortress of the king of the north, and he did against them, and was strong:[8]And also their gods with their molten images, with the vessels of their desire of silver and gold he shall bring in captivity to Egypt; and he shall stand years above the king of the north.[9]And the king of the south came into his kingdom, and turned back, to his land.[10]And his sons shall gather themselves together, and they collected a multitude of many forces: and he coming, came and overflowed, and through: and he will turn back, and they shall gather themselves together even to his fortress.[11]And the king of the south shall be exasperated, and shall come forth and war with him, with the king of the north: and he caused a great multitude to stand, and the multitude was given into his hand.[12]And taking away the multitude his heart shall be lifted up; and he cast down myriads, and he shall not be strengthened.[13]And the king of the north turned back and caused a great multitude to stand above the former, and at the end of times, years, coming he shall come with great strength and with much property.[14]And in these times many shall stand up against the king of the south: and the sons of the violent of thy people shall be lifted up to cause the vision to stand; and they were weak.[15]And the king of the north shall come and shall pour out a mound, and take the city of fortifications: and the arms of the south shall not stand, and the people of his choices, and no strength to stand.[16]And he coming against him will do according to his will, and none standing before his face: and he shall stand in the land of glory, and it was finished in his hand.[17]And he shall set up his face to come with the power of all his kingdom, and the upright with him; and he did: and he will give to him the daughter of women, to corrupt her: and she shall not stand, and shall not be for him.[18]And he will turn back his face to the isles and take many: and a leader caused his reproach to cease to him; besides his reproach shall turn back to him.[19]And he shall turn back his face to the fortress of his land: and he was weak and he fell, and he shall not be found.[20]And there stood up upon his place he causing a task-master to pass through the glory of his kingdom: and in some days he shall be broken, and not in anger and not in war.[21]And there stood up upon his place he being despised;

and it shall not be as the first, and as the last.[30]And the inhabitants of the desert, the Chittims came against him: and he was dejected, and he turned back, and was angry against the holy covenant: and he did, and turned back; and he shall understand for those forsaking the holy covenant.[31]And seed from him shall stand up, and they profaned the holy place of strength, and they removed the Continuance, and they gave the abomination laying waste.[32]And those condemning the covenant shall pollute by smooth things: and the people knowing their God shall be strong and do.[33]And those understanding of the people shall cause to understand to many: and they were weak by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by plunder, days.[34]And in their being weak they shall be helped with a little help: and many were joined to them by flatteries.[35]And from those understanding shall be weak to try upon them to separate, to become white even to the time of the end: for yet at the appointment.[36]And the king did according to his will; and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself over every god; and against the God of gods he shall speak wonderful things, and he prospered even till anger was finished: for that being determined was done.[37]And concerning the God of his fathers he shall not understand, and concerning the desire of women, and concerning every god he shall not understand; for he shall magnify himself over all.[38]And to the God of fortresses he shall do honor upon his place: and to a god which his fathers knew not he shall do honor with gold and with silver, and with precious stone, and with desires.[39]And he did to the strong fortifications with a strange god whom he recognized, he shall multiply honor: and he caused them to rule over many, and he will divide the land for a price.[40]And in the time of the end the king of the south shall wage war with him: and the king of the north shall rush on like a tempest against him, with chariot and with horsemen, and with many ships;

And Jehovah will say to Hosea, Go, take to thee a wife of fornication and children of fornication; for the land committing fornication, will commit fornication from after Jehovah.[3]And he will go and take Gomer, daughter of Diblaim; and she will conceive and bring forth to him a son.[4]And Jehovah will say to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little and I reviewed the bloods of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and I caused the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.[5]And it was in that day and I broke the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.[6]And she will yet conceive and bring forth a daughter. And he will say to him, Call her name, Not being compassionated: for I will no more add to compassionate the house of Israel; for taking away, I will take them away.[7]And I will compassionate the house of Judah, and I saved them by Jehovah their God, and I will not save them by bow and by sword, and by battle, by horses and by horsemen.[8]And she will wean the Not being compassionated, and she will conceive and bring forth a son.[9]And he will say; Call his name, Not my people: for ye are not my people, and I will not be to you.[10]And the number of the sons of Israel was as the sand of the sea which shall not be measured and shall not be numbered: and it was in the place which it shall be said to them, Ye are not my people, and it shall be said to them, Ye the sons of the living God.[11]And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel were gathered together, and they appointed to them one head, and they came up out of the land: for great the day of Jezreel.","Hos.2":"[1]Say ye to your brethren, My people;

and she sought them and she shall not find: and she said, I will go and turn back to my former husband, for it was well to me then more than now.[8]And she knew not that I gave to her grain, and new wine, and new oil, and I multiplied silver to her, and gold they made for Baal.[9]For this I will turn back and take away my grain in its time, and my new wine in its appointment, and I took away my wool and my linen to cover her nakedness.[10]And now will I uncover her wickedness before the eyes of those loving her, and a man shall not deliver her from my hand.[11]And I caused all her rejoicing to cease, her festival and her new moon, and her Sabbath and all her appointment.[12]And I destroyed her vine and her fig tree, of which she said, They are wages to me which those loving me gave to me: and I set them for a forest, and the beasts of the field ate them.[13]And I reviewed upon her the days of the Baals, which she will burn incense to them, and she will be decked with her earring and her necklace, and she will go after those loving her, and she forget me, says Jehovah.[14]For this, behold, I entice her, and I caused her to go into the desert, and I spake to her heart.[15]And I gave to her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she was humbled there as the days of her youth and as the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.[16]And it was in that day, says Jehovah, thou shalt call me, My husband; and thou shalt no more call to me, My Lord.[17]And I put away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.[18]And I cut out for them a covenant in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the earth: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and I caused them to lie down confidently.[19]And I betrothed thee to me forever;

And sought him not in all this.[11]And Ephraim will be as an enticed dove, not a heart: they called Egypt, they went to Assur.[12]When they shall go I will spread my net upon them; as birds of the heavens I will bring them down; I will correct them when hearing to their assembly.[13]Wo! to them, for they fled from me: destruction to them because they transgressed against me: and I will redeem them and they spake falsehoods against me.[14]And they cried not to me in their heart, for they shall wail upon their beds: for corn and new wine they will assemble themselves together; they will turn aside against me.[15]And I corrected and strengthened their arms, and they will purpose evil against me.[16]They will turn back not to the Highest: they were as a bow of deceit: their chiefs shall fall by the sword from the wrath of their tongue: this their derision in the land of Egypt.","Hos.8":"[1]The trumpet to thy mouth: as an eagle upon the house of Jehovah, because they passed by my covenant and they transgressed against my laws.[2]Israel shall cry to me, My God, we knew thee.[3]Israel rejected the good: the enemy shall pursue him.[4]They made kings, and not from me: and they made princes, and I knew not: their silver and their gold they made to them images to cut off.[5]Thy calf rejected, O Shomeron; mine anger was kindled against them: how long shall they not be able to be clean?[6]For from Israel, and this workman made it, and it is not God: for the calf of Shomeron shall be broken in pieces.[7]For they shall sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: no stalk to it: the sprout shall not make flour: perhaps it will make, strangers will swallow it down.[8]Israel was swallowed down: now they were among the nations as a vessel no delight in it.[9]For they went up to Assur, Ephraim a wild ass alone to himself: they hired those loving.[10]Also if they will hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and shall they be weak a little from the lifting up of the king of the princes.[11]Because Ephraim multiplied altars to sin, altars were to him to sin.[12]I will write to him his multitude of my instructions; they were reckoned as a strange thing.[13]The sacrifices of my gifts they will sacrifice flesh, and they will eat; Jehovah delighted not in them; now will he remember their iniquity, and he will review their sins: they shall turn back to Egypt.[14]And Israel will forget him making him, and he will build temples; and Judah multiplied fortified cities: and I sent a fire upon his cities and it will consume its palaces.","Hos.9":"[1]Thou shalt not rejoice, O Israel; exult not as the peoples: for thou didst commit fornication from thy God; thou didst love a gift upon all the threshing-floors of grain.[2]The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.[3]They shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah; and Ephraim turned back to Egypt, and in Assur they shall eat the unclean thing.[4]They shall not pour out wine to Jehovah, and they shall not be pleasant to him: their sacrifices as the bread of sorrows to them; all eating it shall be defiled: for their bread for their soul shall not come in to the house of Jehovah.[5]What will ye do for the day of appointment, and for the day of the festival of Jehovah?[6]For behold, they went from destruction: Egypt shall gather them together; Memphis shall bury them: the desire for their silver, the prickly weed shall possess them: the thorn in their tents.[7]The days of oversight came, the days of recompense came; Israel knew: the prophet is foolish, the man of the spirit, raving, for the multitude of thine iniquity and great destruction.[8]The watchman of Ephraim with God: the prophet the snare of a fowler upon all his ways; destruction in the house of his God.[9]They made deep, they were corrupted as the days of the hill: he will remember their iniquity, he will review their sins.[10]I found Israel as grapes in the desert; as the first fruit in the fig tree in her beginning I saw your fathers: they went to Baal-Peor, and they will separate themselves to shame, and their abominable things will be according to their love.[11]Ephraim shall fly away as a bird, their glory of birth and of the womb and of conception.[12]But if they shall bring up their sons and I bereaved them from man: but also wo to them in my departing from them.[13]Ephraim, as I saw for Tyre, was planted in a habitation: and Ephraim to bring forth his sons to him slaying.[14]Give to them, O Jehovah: what wilt thou give? give to them a miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.[15]All their wickedness in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the evil of their doings I will drive them out from my house, I will not add to love them: all their chiefs are turning away.[16]Ephraim was smitten, their root was dried up, they shall not make fruit: also if they shall bring forth, and I destroyed the desires of their womb.[17]God will reject them, for they heard not to him: and they will be wandering about among the nations.","Hos.10":"[1]Israel an empty vine, he will place fruit to himself: according to the multitude to his fruit he multiplied to his altars; according to the goodness of his land they made good pillars.[2]Their heart was divided; now shall they be guilty: he will break down their altars, he shall lay waste their images.[3]For now they will say, No king to us because we feared not Jehovah; and what shall the king do to us?[4]They spake words swearing falsehood, cutting out a covenant: and judgment broke forth as the head upon the furrows of the field.[5]For the calves of the house of vanity they shall fear dwelling in Shomeron: for his people mourned over it, and his priests will exult over it, for its glory, for it was removed from it.[6]Also it shall be brought to Assur a gift to king Jareb: Ephraim shall take shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his counsel.[7]Shomeron, her king was cut off as chiefs upon the face of the waters.[8]And the heights of vanity were destroyed, the sin of Israel: the thorn and weeds shall come up upon their altars; and they said to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall upon us.[9]From the days of the hill thou didst sin, O Israel: there they stood: the battle in the hill against the sons of iniquity shall not overtake them.[10]In my coming and I shall correct them, and the peoples shall be gathered together against them in their being bound to their two sins.[11]And Ephraim a heifer being taught, loving to tread out the grain, and I passed over upon the good of her neck: I will cause Ephraim to ride; Judah shall be silent, and Jacob shall be strong to him.[12]Sow to yourselves for justice, reap ye for the mouth of kindness; break up to you the fallow ground: and the time to seek Jehovah till he shall come and cast justice upon you.[13]Ye ploughed injustice, ye reaped iniquity; ye ate the fruit of falsehood: for thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy strong ones.[14]And an uproar arose among thy people, and all thy fortifications shall be laid waste, as Shaman laid waste the house of the ambush of God in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon the sons.[15]Thus did the house of God to you from the face of the evil of your evil: in the morning the king of Israel being cut off, was cut off.","Hos.11":"[1]When Israel was a child, and I loved him, and I called for my son out of Egypt.[2]They called to them, thus they went from them: they will sacrifice to the Baals, and to the carved images they will burn incense.[3]And I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms; and they knew not that I healed them.[4]I will draw them with the cords of man, with the bands of love: and I will be to them as those lifting up the yoke upon their jaw-bones, and I will gently give them to eat.[5]He shall not turn back to the land of Egypt, and Assur shall be his king, for they refused to turn back.[6]And the sword was polished in his cities, and it consumed his branches, and devoured from their counsels.[7]And my people are bent to turning away from me: and they will call together to the Most High; he will not exalt them.[8]How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? Shall I deliver thee over, O Israel? How shall I give thee as the earth? Shall I set thee as roes? My heart was turned upon me; my grievings were kindled together.[9]I will not do the burning of mine anger, I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not a man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come into the city.[10]They shall go after Jehovah: as a lion shall he roar: for he shall roar, and the sons of the waters shall tremble.[11]They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assur: and I caused them to dwell in their houses, says Jehovah.[12]Ephraim surrounded me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: and Judah even ruled with God, and was faithful with the holy ones.","Hos.12":"[1]Ephraim fed upon the wind, and he pursued the east wind: all the day he multiplied falsehood and destruction; and they will cut out a covenant with Assur, and oil will be brought to Egypt.[2]And a contention to Jehovah with Judah, and to review Jacob according to his ways; he will turn back to him according to his doings.[3]In the belly he circumvented his brother, and by his strength he was a leader with God.[4]And he will be a leader to the messenger, and he will prevail: he wept, and he will make supplication to him: in the house of God he will find him, and there he will speak with him.[5]And Jehovah God of armies, Jehovah his remembrance.[6]And thou, in thy God thou shalt turn back: watch mercy and judgment, and wait always for thy God.[7]Canaan in his hand, the balances of deceit: he loved to oppress.[8]And Ephraim will say, Surely I became rich, I found to me wealth: all my labors shall not be found to me iniquity which was sin.[9]And I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will even cause thee to dwell in tents as in the days of the appointment.[10]And I spake by the prophets, and I multiplied the vision, and by the hand of the prophets I will use similitudes.[11]If Gilead nothing? Surely they were vanity: in Gilgal they sacrificed oxen; also their altars as heaps upon the furrows of the field.[12]And Jacob will flee to the field of Aram, and Israel will serve for a wife, and for a wife he watched.[13]And by a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.[14]Ephraim provoked bitternesses, and bloods shall fly swiftly upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord turn back to him.","Hos.13":"[1]According to the word Ephraim being terrified be was lifted up in Israel; and he will transgress in Baal and die.[2]And now they will add to sin, and they will make to them a molten image of their silver, in their understanding images the work of artificers all of it: they saying to them, The men sacrificing shall kiss the calves.[3]For this they shall be as the cloud of the morning, and as the early dew going way; as the chaff will be driven from the threshing-floor on the wind, and as the smoke from the chimney.[4]And I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt not know a God except me: and none saving but me.[5]I knew thee in the desert, in the land of thirst.[6]According to their pasture, and they will be satiated; they were satiated, and their heart will be lifted up: for this they forgat me.[7]And I will be to them as a lion: as a panther upon the way I will look around.[8]I will fall upon them as a bear bereaved, and I will rend the enclosure of their heart, and devour them there as a lion: the beast of the field shall cleave them asunder.[9]O Israel, thou didst destroy thyself; but in me in thy help.[10]Now will I be thy king, and he shall save thee in all thy cities, and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Thou shalt give to me a king and princes.[11]I will give to thee a king in mine anger, and I will take away in my wrath.[12]The iniquity of Ephraim was bound up; his sin was concealed.[13]The pains of her bringing forth shall come to him: he a son not wise; for now he shall not stand in the breaking forth of sons.[14]From the hand of hades will I redeem them; from death will I ransom them: I will be thy words, O death, I will be thy cutting off, O hades: consolation will be hid from mine eyes.[15]If he shall bear fruit in the midst of his brethren, the east wind shall come, the wind of Jehovah came up from the desert, and his fountain shall be dried up, and he shall lay waste his place of fountains: he shall plunder the treasure of all vessels of desire.[16]Shomeron shall be guilty, for she rebelled against her God: by the sword shall they fall: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and they having conceived shall be cleft asunder.","Hos.14":"[1]Turn back, O Israel, even to Jehovah thy God, for thou wert weak in thine iniquity.[2]Take with you words and turn back to Jehovah: say to him, Thou wilt take away all iniquity, and take good: and we will requite the fruits of our lips.[3]Assur will not save us; we will not ride upon a horse, and we will no more say, Our God, to the work of our hands, for in thee the orphan shall be compassionated.[4]I will heal their turning away, I loved them largely: for mine anger turned away from him.[5]I will be as the dew to Israel: he shall blossom as the lily and strike his roots as Lebanon.[6]His sprouts shall go, and his strength shall be as the olive tree, and the odor to him as Lebanon.[7]They sitting in his shadow shall turn back; they shall live upon the grain, and they shall blossom as the vine: his remembrance as the wine of Lebanon.[8]Ephraim: What to me yet to images? I humbled, and I will regard him: I as the green cypress From me thy fruit was found.[9]Who being wise, and he shall understand these things? and knowing, and he shall know them? for the ways of Jehovah are straight, and the just shall go in them: and they transgressing shall be weak in them.","Joel.1":"[1]The word of Jehovah which was to Joel son of Pethuel.[2]Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the earth. Was this in your days, and if in the days of your fathers?[3]Concerning it recount to your sons, and your sons to their sons, and their sons to another generation.[4]The residue of the creeping locust the common locust ate; and the residue of the common locust the feeder ate; and the residue of the feeder the devourer ate.[5]Awake, ye intoxicated, and weep; and wail, all ye drinking wine, on account of the new wine, for it was cut off from your mouth.[6]For a nation came up upon my land, strong, and no number; his teeth the teeth of a lion, and a biter’s teeth of the lioness to him.[7]He set my vine for destruction, and my fig tree for breaking: he stripped off its covering and cast away; and its shoots were whitened.[8]Wail as the virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.[9]The gift was cut off and the libation from the house of Jehovah; mourn, ye priests serving Jehovah.[10]The field was laid waste, the land mourned; for the grain was laid waste, the new wine was dried up, the new oil languished.[11]The husbandmen were ashamed; wail, ye vine-dressers, for the wheat and for the barley, for the harvest of the field perished.[12]The vine was dried up, and the fig tree languished; the pomegranate, also the palm tree and the apple tree; all the trees of the field were dried up, for joy was dried up from the sons of man.[13]Be ye girded and lament, ye priests: wail, ye, serving the altar: come in, pass the night in sackcloth, ye serving God: for the gift and the libation were withheld from the house of your God.[14]Consecrate a fast, call an assembly, gather together the old men, all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah.[15]Alas! for the day: for the day of Jehovah is near, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.[16]Was not the food cut off before our eyes, from the house of our God, joy and gladness?[17]The kernels died beneath the clods, the treasures were laid waste, the garners were pulled down, for the grain was dried up.[18]How the beasts groaned! the herds of oxen wept, for no pasture to them; also the flocks of sheep were laid waste.[19]To thee, O Jehovah, will I call: for a fire consumed the habitations of the desert, and the flame burned all the trees of the field.[20]Also the beasts of the field will look up to thee: for the channels of waters were dried up, and the fire devoured the habitations of the desert.","Joel.2":"[1]Clang ye the trumpet in Zion, shout in my holy mountain: all the inhabitants of the land shall be moved, for the day of Jehovah is coming, for it is near.[2]A day of darkness and of thick darkness; a day of cloud and gloom as the morning spread upon the mountains: great and strong people; the like to him was not from forever, and after him there shall not be added even to the years of generation and generation.[3]Before him a fire devoured, and after him a flame shall burn; the land as the garden of Eden before him, and after him a desert of desolation; and also there was no escaping to him.[4]His appearance as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen so shall they run.[5]As the voice of chariots upon the heads of the mountains they shall leap, as the voice of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people set in order for battle.[6]From his face peoples shall be pained: all faces gathered a glow.[7]They shall run as strong men; as men of war they shall come up upon the wall; and they shall go each in his ways; they shall not change their paths.[8]And they shall not thrust a man his brother; they shall go a man in his high way: and in the midst of the javelin shall they fall, they shall not be cut in pieces.[9]In the city they shall run up and down; on the wall shall they run, into the houses they shall come up, through the windows shall they come in as a thief.[10]The earth was moved before his face; the heavens trembled: the sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars took away their shining:[11]And Jehovah gave his voice before the face of his strength: for exceedingly great his camp, and strong he doing his word: for great the day of Jehovah, and exceedingly terrible;

consecrate a fast, call a restraining.[16]Gather the people, consecrate the convocation, assemble the old men, gather the children and those sucking the breasts: the bridegroom shall come forth from his chamber and the bride from her nuptial couch.[17]Between the porch and to the altar the priests serving Jehovah shall weep, and they shall say, Spare, O Jehovah, thy people, and thou wilt not give thine inheritance to reproach for the nations to rule over them: wherefore shall they say among the peoples, Where is their God?[18]And Jehovah will be jealous for his land, and he will pity for his people.[19]And Jehovah will answer and say to his people, Behold me sending to you the grain and the new wine, and the new oil; and ye were satisfied with it: and I will no more give you a reproach among the nations.[20]And the northern I will remove far off from you, and I thrust him into a land of dryness and desolation, with his face to the east sea, and his end to the last sea; and his stink came up, and his stench shall come up, for he magnified to do.[21]Thou shalt not fear, O land; rejoice and be glad, for Jehovah magnified to do.[22]Ye shall not fear, ye beasts of the field, for the pastures of the desert sprang forth, for the tree bore its fruit, the fig tree and the vine gave their strength.[23]Ye sons of Zion rejoice and be glad in Jehovah your God; for he gave to you the early rain for justice, and he will bring down to you the rain, the early and latter rain in the first.[24]And the threshing-floors were filled with grain, and the wine-vats overflowed with new wine and new oil.[25]And I requited to you the years which the common locust ate, the feeder, and the devourer, and the creeping locust, my great army which I sent among you.[26]And eating, ye ate and were satisfied, and ye praised the name of Jehovah your God who did wonderfully with you: and my people shall not be ashamed forever.[27]And ye knew that I am in the midst of Israel, and I am Jehovah your God, and none else: and my people shall not be ashamed forever.[28]And it was after this I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters prophesied, your old men shall dream your young men shall see visions.[29]And also upon the servants and upon the maids in those days I will pour out my spirit.[30]And I gave wonders in the heavens, and in the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke.[31]The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and the terrible day of Jehovah.[32]And it was all who shall call upon the name of Jehovah shall escape: for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be an escaping, as said Jehovah;

for so it is suitable for us to complete all justice: then he permitted him.[16]And Jesus, having been immersed, went up straight from the water, and, behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.[17]And behold a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.","Matt.4":"[1]Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the desert to be tried by the devil.[2]And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.[3]And the tempter having come to him, said, If thou art the Son of God, say that these stones should become bread.[4]And he having answered, said, It has been written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word going forth through the mouth of God.[5]Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and sets him upon the small wing of the temple;[6]And says to him, If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down; for it has been written, That to his messengers he will command concerning thee; and in the hands shall they lift thee up, lest that perhaps thou strike thy foot against a stone.[7]Jesus said to him, Again has it been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.[8]Again, the devil takes him into a very high mount, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;[9]And he says to him, All these will I give to thee, if, falling down, thou wouldst worship me.[10]Then says Jesus to him, Retire, Satan; for it has been written, The Lord thy God shalt thou worship, and him alone shalt thou serve.[11]Then the devil lets him go, and behold, the messengers came up, and they served him.[12]And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, went back into Galilee.[13]And having left Nazareth behind, having come, he dwelt in Capernaum, near the sea, in the boundaries of Zabulon and Nephthalim:[14]That it might be completed having been spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,[15]The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations:[16]The people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to them sitting in the room and shadow of death, light has sprung up to them.[17]From then Jesus began to proclaim, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.[18]And Jesus, walking about by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon being called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a sweep-net into the sea; for they were fishermen.[19]And he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you the fishermen of men.[20]And they instantly having let go their nets, followed him.[21]And having proceeded thence, he saw other two brethren, James him of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, adjusting their nets; and he called them.[22]And they having instantly let go the ship and their father, followed him.[23]And Jesus went about the whole of Galilee, teaching in their assemblies, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing disease, and every weakness in the people.[24]And a report went forth of him into the whole of Syria: and they brought to him all those having injuries, being oppressed by various diseases, and trials, and being under the influence of a demon, and being lunatics, and paralytics, and he cured them.[25]And many crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond Jordan.","Matt.5":"[1]And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain; and he having sat down, his disciples came to him.[2]And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,[3]Happy the poor in spirit: for their’s is the kingdom of the heavens.[4]Happy they suffering: for they shall be comforted.[5]Happy the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.[6]Happy they hungering and thirsting for Justice: for they shall be filled.[7]Happy the compassionate: for they shall be commiserated.[8]Happy the pure in heart: for they shall see God.[9]Happy they making peace: for they shall be called sons of God.[10]Happy they driven out for justice: for their’s is the kingdom of the heavens.[11]Happy are ye, when they shall upbraid you, and drive you out, and say every evil word against you, lying, for my sake.[12]Rejoice and be transported with joy; for much your reward in the heavens for so they drove out the prophets which before you.[13]Ye are the salt of the earth: and if the salt be rendered insipid, with what shall it be salted? it is yet strong for nothing, except to be cast without, and to be trodden under foot of men.[14]Ye are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid, set on a mountain.[15]Neither do they burn a light, and set it under a basket, but upon a chandelier: and it shines to all in the house.[16]So let your light shine before men, that they see your good works, and praise your Father, him in the heavens.[17]Think not that I have come to abolish the law, or the prophets: for I have come not abolish, but to complete.[18]For verily I say to you, Till heaven pass away, and earth, one iota, or one mark, should not pass away from the law, till all should be.[19]Whoever therefore, should loose one of the least of these commands, and so teach men, he shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens: but whoever should do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.[20]For I say to you, That except your justice abound more than the scribes and Pharisees, ye should not come into the kingdom of the heavens.[21]Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill: and whoever should kill shall be subject to judgment:[22]But I say to you, That every one becoming angry with his brother, shall be subject to judgment: and whoever should say to his brother, Raca, should be, subject to the council: and whoever should say, O foolish, shall be subject to a hell of fire.[23]If therefore, thou bring thy gift upon the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother has anything against thee,[24]Let go there thy gift, before the altar, and retire; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then, having come, bring thy gift.[25]Be kindly disposed to thy opponent quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest thy opponent should deliver thee to the judge, and the judge should deliver thee to the assistant, and thou be cast into prison.[26]Verily I say to thee, Thou shouldst not come out thence, even till, thou shouldst give back the last fourth.[27]Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery:[28]But I say to you, That every one seeing a woman, to eagerly desire her, has already committed adultery with her, in his heart.[29]And if thine eye give thee cause of offence, take it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members be destroyed, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.[30]And if thy right hand give thee cause of offence, cut it off, and cast from thee; for it is profitable to thee, that one of thy members should be destroyed; and not thy whole body should be cast into hell.[31]And it was said, That whosoever should loose his wife, let him give her a repudiation.[32]But I say to you, That whosoever shall let go his wife except for the reason of adultery, makes her to commit adultery; and whosoever should marry her having been loosed, commits adultery.[33]Again, ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not swear a false oath, and thou shalt return to the Lord thine oaths.[34]But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, it is the throne of God:[35]Neither by the earth; for it is the footstool of his feet: neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great kings.[36]Neither shouldst thou swear by thy head, for thou cant not make one hair white or black.[37]But let your word be Yea, yea, and No, no: but that above this is of evil.[38]Ye have heard, that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:[39]But I say to you, not to resist evil: but whosoever shall smite thee with a rod upon thy right cheek, turn to him also the other.[40]And to him wishing to be judged with thee, and to take thy coat, let go to him also thy garment.[41]And whoever shall compel thee to carry dispatches one mile, go forward with him two.[42]To him asking thee, give thou, and him wishing to borrow from thee, thou shouldst not turn away.[43]Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.[44]But I say to you, Love your enemies, praise them cursing you, do well to them hating you, and pray for them threatening you, and driving you out.[45]So that ye might be sons of your Father, which in the heavens: for he makes his sun rise upon evil and good, and rains on the just and unjust.[46]For if ye love them loving you, what reward have you? do not also the tax collectors the same?[47]And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye above ordinary? and do not the tax collectors the same?[48]Therefore, be ye perfected, as your Father which is in the heavens is perfected.","Matt.6":"[1]Attend ye not to do your justice before men, to be seen to them; and if otherwise ye have no reward from your Father which in the heavens.[2]When therefore thou doest alms, thou shouldst not sound the trumpet before thee, as hypocrites do in the assemblies, and in the streets, that they might be praised by men. Verily I say to you, They have their reward.[3]But thou doing alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right does:[4]That thine alms might be in secret; and thy Father, who seeing in secret, shall give back to thee openly.[5]And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love in the assemblies, and in the corners of the broad ways to stand praying, so that they might appear to men. Verily I say to you, that they have their reward.[6]But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy store-house, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father who seeing in secret shall give back to thee openly.[7]And praying, talk ye not vainly as the nations; for they think that by their profaneness of speech they shall be listened to.[8]Therefore make not yourselves like them: for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye ask him.[9]Therefore so do ye pray: Our Father which in the heavens, Let thy name be declared holy.[10]Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be as in heaven also upon the earth.[11]Give us this day our bread sufficient for sustenance.[12]And let go to us our debts, as we let go to our debtors.[13]And thou shouldst not lead us into temptation, but deliver thou us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.[14]For if ye let go to men their faults, your Father which in the heavens will also let go to you.[15]But if ye should not let go to men their faults, neither will your Father let go your faults.[16]And when ye fast, be not, as hypocrites, of gloomy aspect: for they conceal their faces that they might appear to men fasting. Verily I say to you, That they have their reward.[17]And thou fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;[18]That thou mightest not appear to men fasting, but to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father which in secret, will give back to thee openly.[19]Treasure not up to you treasures upon earth, where moth and gnawing destroy, and thieves dig through and steal:[20]But treasure to you treasures in heaven, where neither moth, nor gnawing destroy; and where thieves dig not through, nor steal.[21]For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.[22]The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light.[23]But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be dark. If therefore the light which in thee is darkness, how much the darkness.[24]None can serve two lords: for either he will hate one and love the other; or hold firmly to one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.[25]For this I say to you, Be not anxious about your soul, what ye eat, and what ye drink; nor about your body, what ye put on. Is not the soul more than food, and the body than dress?[26]Look ye upon the fowls of heaven; for they neither sow, nor reap, nor collect into stores; and your heavenly Father nourishes them. Do ye not rather differ from them.[27]Which of you, being anxious, can add one cubit to his size?[28]And about dress, why are ye anxious? Consider the white lilies of the field, how they grow; they are not wearied, neither do they spin:[29]And I say to you, that neither Solomon in all his glory was surrounded as one of these.[30]And if the grass of the field, being this day, and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes much rather you, ye of little faith![31]Therefore be ye not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, What shall we put round us?[32]For all these the nations seek for; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these.[33]But seek first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these shall be added to you.[34]Therefore should ye not be anxious about the morrow: for the morrow shall be anxious about the things of itself. Sufficient for the day its evil.","Matt.7":"[1]Judge not, that ye be not judged.[2]For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye measure, it shall be repaid to you.[3]And why seest thou the mote which is in thy brother’s eye, and the beam in thine eye thou observest not?[4]Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let go I will cast out the mote from thine eye: and behold a beam in thine eye.[5]Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam from thine eye, and thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote from thy brother’s eye.[6]Ye should not give the holy thing to dogs neither should ye cast your pearls before swine, lest they tread them down with their feet, and having turned, should rend you.[7]Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you.[8]For everyone asking, receives and he seeking, finds; and to him knocking shall be opened.[9]Or what man is of you, which, if his son ask bread, he will not give him a stone?[10]And if he ask a fish, he will not give him a serpent?[11]If ye, therefore, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father which is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?[12]Therefore all whatever ye would that men should do to you, so also do ye to them; for this is the law and the prophets.[13]Enter ye in through the strait gate, for broad the gate and spacious the way leading to destruction, and many are they coming in through it.[14]For strait the gate and afflicted the way leading into life, and few are they finding it.[15]And hold from false prophets which come in to you in sheep’s dresses, but within they are rapacious wolves.[16]By their fruits shall ye know them. Far from it, do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from caltrops.[17]So every good tree makes good fruits; but the rotten tree makes evil fruits.[18]A good tree cannot make evil fruits, nor a rotten tree make good fruits.[19]Every tree not making good fruit is cut off, and cast into fire.[20]Wherefore from their fruits shall ye know them.[21]Not every one saying to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but he doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.[22]Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have we cast out evil spirits, and in thy name done many powers?[23]And then shall I confess to them that I never knew you. Go away from me, ye working iniquity.[24]Therefore, every one which hears these my words and does them, I will liken him to a discerning man which built his house upon the rock.[25]And the rain descended, and rivers came, and winds blew, and fell upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon the rock.[26]And every one hearing these my words and doing them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house upon sand.[27]And the rain descended, and rivers came, and winds blew and struck upon that house, and it fell, and great was its fall.[28]And it was when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were struck with amazement at his teaching:[29]For he was teaching them as having power, and not as the scribes.","Matt.8":"[1]And having come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.[2]And, behold, a leper, having come, worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.[3]And having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed and instantly his leprosy was cleansed.[4]And Jesus says to him, See thou tell no one; but retire, show thyself to the priest, and bring near the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.[5]And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, a captain of a hundred came to him, and beseeching him,[6]And saying, Lord, my servant has been laid up in the house a paralytic, being grievously tormented.[7]And Jesus says to him, I, having come, will cure him.[8]And the captain of a hundred having answered said, Lord, I am not fit that thou shouldest enter in under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.[9]For I also am a man under power, having soldiers under me: and I say to this, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does.[10]And Jesus having heard, admired, and said to those following; Verily I say to you, not in Israel have I found such faith.[11]And I say to you, That many shall come from the sunrising and the descents, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens.[12]But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.[13]And Jesus said to the captain of a hundred, Retire; as thou hast believed, let it be to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour.[14]And Jesus, having come into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law having been laid up, and affected with fever.[15]And he touched her hand, and the fever let her go: and she arose, and served them.[16]And evening being come, they brought him many possessed with evil spirits: and he east out the spirits by the word, and cured all having evils:[17]So that that spoken by Esaias the prophet was completed, saying. He took our weakness, and lifted up diseases.[18]And Jesus seeing many crowds about him, encouraged to go away beyond.[19]And one scribe, coming near, said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.[20]And Jesus says to him, The foxes have dens, and the fowls of heaven occupy nests; but the Son of man has not where he might recline the head.[21]And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, permit me first to go and inter my father.[22]But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead inter the dead.[23]And he having gone into a ship, his disciples followed him.[24]And, behold, a great shaking was in the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves: and be slept.[25]And his disciples, having come near, awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we are lost.[26]And he says to them, Why are ye timorous, ye of little faith? Then having risen, he censured the winds and sea; and there was a great calm.[27]And the men admired, saying, of what race is this for the winds and the sea listen to him.[28]And he having come beyond the country of the Gergesenes, two possessed with evil spirits, coming out of the tombs, met him, very rough, so that not any could pass by that way.[29]And, behold, they cried out, saying, What to us and thee, Jesus, Son of God? hast thou come here to torture us before the time.[30]And far off from them was a herd of many swine grazing.[31]And the evil spirits besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.[32]And he said to them, Retire. And having gone, they went away into the herd of swine: and, behold, all the herd of swine rushed down the precipice into the sea, and died in the water.[33]And they feeding fled; and having come into the city, they announced all things, and those of the possessed with evil spirits.[34]And, behold, all the city came forth to the meeting to Jesus: and seeing him, they besought that he would go away from their boundaries.","Matt.9":"[1]And having entered into a ship, he passed over and came into his own city.[2]And, behold, they brought him a paralytic, laid upon a bed; and Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child thy sins are let go to thee.[3]And behold, certain of the scribes said in themselves, This defames.[4]And Jesus seeing their reflections, said, Why reflect ye within your hearts?[5]For why is it easier to say, Sins are let go to thee; or say, Arise and walk?[6]But that ye might know that the Son of man has power upon earth to let go sins, (then he says to the paralytic), Having risen, take up thy bed and retire to thy house.[7]And having risen, he went away into his house.[8]And the crowds, seeing, admired, and praised God, giving such power to men.[9]And Jesus, passing away from thence, saw a man sitting by the custom-house, being called Matthew, and he says to him, Follow me; and having risen he followed him.[10]And it was he sitting at table in the house, and behold, many tax collectors and sinful, having come, sat at table with Jesus and his disciples.[11]And the Pharisees, seeing, said to his disciples, Wherefore does your teacher eat with tax collectors and the sinful?[12]And Jesus having heard, said to them, They being strong have no need of a physician, but they having evils.[13]And having gone, learn what is this, I wish mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.[14]Then came to him the disciples of John; saying, Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples fast not?[15]And Jesus said to them, The sons of the nuptial chamber cannot mourn inasmuch as the bridegroom is with them; but the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast.[16]And no one puts on a cover of uncombed fragment upon an old garment, for its filling takes away from the garment, and the division is Worse.[17]Neither do they cast new wine into old wine-skins: but if otherwise, the wine-skins burst, and the wine is poured out, and the wine-skins are destroyed; but they cast new wine into new wine-skins, and they are both preserved.[18]He speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler, having come, worshipped him, saying; That my daughter has just now died: but having come, put thy hand upon her, and she shall live.[19]And Jesus having risen, followed him: also his disciples.[20]And behold, a woman discharging blood twelve years, having come near behind, touched the hem of his garment:[21]For she said in herself, If I should only touch the hem of his garment, I shall be saved.[22]And Jesus having turned round, and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; thy faith has saved thee. And the woman was saved from that hour.[23]And Jesus having come into the ruler’s house, and seeing the flute players and the crowd making an uproar,[24]He says to them, Give way; for the girl is not dead but sleeps; and they mocked him.[25]But when the crowd was driven forth, having entered, he seized her hand, and the little girl was awakened.[26]And this report went forth into that whole land.[27]And Jesus passing from thence, two blind ones followed him, crying out and saying, Commiserate us, O son of David.[28]And having come into the house, the blind came to him: and Jesus says to them, Believe ye that I can do this? They say to him, Yes, Lord.[29]Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you.[30]And their eyes were opened; and Jesus threatened them, saying, See, let none know.[31]But they, having gone out, divulged it in that, whole land.[32]And they having gone, behold they brought to him a man dumb, possessed with an evil spirit.[33]And the demon being cast out, the dumb, spake, and the crowd admired, saying, It was never so brought to light in Israel.[34]But the Pharisees said, By the chief of demons he casts out demons.[35]And Jesus went about all the cities and towns, teaching in their assemblies, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every weakness in the people.[36]And having seen the crowds, he felt compassion for them, for they were relaxed and dispersed, as sheep not having a shepherd.[37]Then he says to his disciples, Truly the harvest much, but the laborers few.[38]Implore therefore the Lord of the harvest, so that he might draw forth laborers into his harvest.","Matt.10":"[1]And having called his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every weakness.[2]And the names of the twelve sent are these: first, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, he of Zebedee and John his brother;[3]Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James, he of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, he surnamed Thaddeus;[4]Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, he also having delivered him up.[5]These twelve Jesus sent, having announced to them, saying, Go not in the way of the nations, and into the city of the Samaritans enter ye not.[6]But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.[7]And going, proclaim, saying, That the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.[8]Cure the sick, cleanse the leprous, rouse the dead, cast out demons; as a gift ye have received, as a gift give.[9]Provide not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;[10]Nor wallet for the way, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor rod: for the laborer is worthy of his food.[11]And to whatever city or town ye should come in, examine who in it is worthy; and there remain till ye go forth.[12]And entering into a house, do ye greet it.[13]And if the house should be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you.[14]And whoever should not receive you, nor hear your words, coming out of that house or that city, shake off the cloud of the dust of your feet.[15]Verily I say to you, it shall be more supportable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.[16]Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore discerning as serpents, and pure as doves.[17]And hold ye from men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their assemblies will they scourge you.[18]And ye shalt be brought before leaders and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.[19]And when they deliver you up, have no care how or what ye should speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.[20]For ye yourselves are not speaking, but the spirit of your father speaking in you.[21]And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child: and children shall rise up in revolt against parents, and kill them.[22]And ye shall be hated by all for my name: and he having remained to the end shall be saved.[23]And when they drive you out in this city, flee ye to another; for verily I say to you, Ye shall not finish the cities of Israel till the Son of man come.[24]The disciple is not above the teacher, nor the servant above his lord.[25]Sufficient to the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzeboul, how much more those pertaining to his household?[26]Therefore fear them not; for nothing has been covered, which shall not be revealed; and concealed, that shall not be known.[27]What I say to you in darkness, speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the houses.[28]And fear not from those killing the body, and not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him able to destroy also soul and body in hell.[29]Are not two little sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the earth without your Father.[30]And also the hairs of your head are all numbered.[31]Fear not therefore; ye have the preeminence over many sparrows.[32]Every one therefore who shall agree with me before men, I also will agree with him before my Father, him in the heavens.[33]But whoever should deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father, him in the heavens.[34]Think not that I came to cast peace upon earth; I came not to cast peace, but a sword.[35]For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the bride against her mother-in-law.[36]And a man’s enemies, they pertaining to his household.[37]He loving father or mother above me, is not worthy of me; and he loving son or daughter above me, is not worthy of me.[38]And whoever takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.[39]He finding his soul shall lose it; and he having lost his soul for my sake shall find it.[40]He receiving you, receives me; and he receiving me, receives him sending me.[41]He receiving a prophet in a prophet’s name, shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he receiving the just in the name of the just, shall take the reward of the just.[42]And whoever should give to drink one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.","Matt.11":"[1]And it was when Jesus finished ordering his twelve disciples, he went away from thence to teach and proclaim in all their cities.[2]And John having heard in prison the works of Christ, having sent two of his disciples,[3]He said to him, Art thou he coming, or should we look for another?[4]And Jesus having answered said to them, Having gone, announce to John what ye hear and see:[5]The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the leprous are cleansed, and the deaf bear, the dead are roused, and the poor have good news announced.[6]And happy is he who shall not give cause of offence in me.[7]And these going forth, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye forth into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?[8]But what went ye out to see? A man clad in soft garments? but they having soft things are in king’s houses.[9]But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more eminent than a prophet.[10]For this is he for whom it was Written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.[11]Verily I say to you, in the begotten of women has there not risen a greater than John the Immerser; but the less in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.[12]From the days of John the Immerser till now the kingdom of the heavens is achieved by force, and they committing violence seize it eagerly.[13]For all the prophets, And the law prophesied till John.[14]And if ye will receive, this is Elias he about to come.[15]He having ears to hear, let him hear.[16]To what shall I liken this generation I it is like little boys sitting in market-places, and calling to their companions,[17]And saying, We played the flute to you, and ye moved not; we lamented to you and ye lamented not.[18]For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has an evil spirit.[19]The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man a glutton, and wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinful; and wisdom has been justified from her children.[20]Then began he to blame the cities in which were his greatest powers, because they repented not.[21]Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if in Tyre and Sidon had been the powers being in you, long since had they repented in sackcloth and ashes.[22]But I say to you, To Tyre and Sidon shall it be more supportable in the day of judgment, than to you.[23]And thou, Capernaum, lifted up even to heaven, thou shalt he brought down to hades: for if in the people of Sodom had been the powers being in thee, they had remained till this day.[24]But I say to you, That to the land of Sodom it shall be more supportable in the day of judgment, than to you.[25]In that time Jesus having answered, said, I acknowledge to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for thou hast hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to children.[26]Yes, Father: for so was it benevolence before thee.[27]All things were delivered to me by my Father; and none knows the Son, except the Father; nor knows any one the Father, except the Son, and to whom the Son will reveal.[28]Come to me, all ye wearied and loaded, and I will cause you to rest.[29]Lift up my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and humble in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls.[30]For my yoke is useful, and my load is light.","Matt.12":"[1]In that time Jesus went in the sabbaths through the standing corn and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears, end eat.[2]And the Pharisees, seeing, said to him, Behold, thy disciples do what is not lawful to do in the sabbath.[3]And he said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they with him;[4]How he went into the house of God, and ate the loaves of setting up, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor those with him, but for the priests alone?[5]Or have ye not read in the law, that in the sabbaths, the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are innocent?[6]But I say to you, That he here is greater than the temple.[7]And if ye knew what it is, I will mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the innocent.[8]For the Lord of the sabbath is also the Son of man.[9]And having passed from thence, he went into their assembly;[10]And, behold, there was a man having the hand withered. And they asked him saying, Is it lawful to cure in the sabbaths? that they might expose him.[11]And he said to them, Which of you shall be the man who shall have one sheep, and if this should fall into a pit in the sabbaths, will he not take hold of it, and raise it up?[12]How much then does a man surpass a sheep? So that it is lawful to do well in the sabbaths.[13]Then says he to the man, Stretch out thy hand; and he stretched it out; and it was restored, sound as the other.[14]And the Pharisees took counsel against him, having gone out, that they might kill him.[15]And Jesus having known, withdrew from thence; and many crowds followed him, and he cured them all;[16]And he rebuked them that they should not make him known:[17]So that that spoken by the prophet Esaias might be completed, saying,[18]Behold my servant, which I have chosen: my dearly beloved, in whom my soul was contented; I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim judgment to the nations.[19]He shall not contend, nor cry; nor shall any hear his voice in the streets.[20]He shall not break a bruised reed, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he should draw forth judgment to victory.[21]And in his name shall the nations hope.[22]Then he possessed with a demon, blind, and dumb, was brought to him; and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb spake and saw also.[23]And all the crowds were affected, and said, Is not this the son of David?[24]But the Pharisees, having heard, said, He casts not out demons, but by Beelzebub, ruler of demons.[25]And Jesus knowing their reflections, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.[26]And if Satan casts out Satan, he was divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?[27]And I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast out? for this shall they be your judges.[28]But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out demons, the kingdom of God has come before hand upon you.[29]Or how can any one come into the house of the strong, and plunder his goods, except be first bind the strong? and then he will plunder his house.[30]He not being with me is against me; and he not gathering with me; scatters.[31]For this I say to you, All sin and blasphemy shall be let go to men; but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be let go to men.[32]And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be remitted to him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be let go to him, neither in this time, nor that about to be.[33]Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree rotten, and its fruit rotten; for the tree is known by its fruit.[34]O generation of vipers! how can ye speak good things, being evil? for out of the abundance of the heart the month speaks.[35]The good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, casts forth good things: and the evil man, out of the evil treasure, casts forth evil things.[36]And I say to you, That every idle word which men speak, they shill return word for it in the day of judgment.[37]For by thy words shalt thou be justified, and by thy words shalt thou be condemned.[38]Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from thee.[39]And he having answered, said to them, An evil generation and an adulteress seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.[40]For as Jonas was in the whale’s belly three days and three nights; so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.[41]The Ninevite men shall rise up in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: for they repented at the proclamation of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas here.[42]The queen of the South shall be raised up in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon here.[43]And when the unclean spirit has gone out from a man, he passes through sterile places, seeking rest, and finds not.[44]Then says he, I will return into my house, whence I came out; and having come, he finds vacant; having been swept, and put in order.[45]Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits, worse than he, and having come in, they dwell there: and the last things of that man are worse than the first. So also shall it be to this evil generation.[46]And he yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.[47]And a certain one said to him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.[48]And he having answered, said to him speaking to him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?[49]And having stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren![50]For whoever should do the will of my Father, him in the heavens, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.","Matt.13":"[1]And in that day Jesus, having come out of the house, sat by the sea.[2]And many crowds were assembled together to him; therefore having entered into the ship, he sat down, and all the crowd stood upon the sea-shore.[3]And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, he, the sower, went forth to sow.[4]And in his sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things came and swallowed them down.[5]And others fell upon rocky places where it had not much earth, and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no depth of earth.[6]And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and for the not having a root, it was dried up.[7]And others fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.[8]And others fell upon good earth and gave fruit, some truly a hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty.[9]He having ears to hear let him hear.[10]And the disciples having come near, said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?[11]And having answered, he said to them, For to you it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it was not given.[12]For whoever has shall be given to him, and he shall have in excess; and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.[13]For this I speak to them in parables: for seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.[14]And the prophecy of Esaias is filled up in them, saying, In hearing shall ye hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.[15]For the heart of this people has been thickened, and with their ears have they heard heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest perhaps they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and turn back, and I should heal them.[16]But happy your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.[17]For verily I say to you, that many prophets and just desired eagerly to see what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.[18]Therefore hear ye the parable of him sowing.[19]Every one hearing, and not understanding, the evil one comes, and carries off that sown in his heart. This is he having sown by the way.[20]And he having sown upon rocky places, this is he hearing the word, and quickly with joy receiving it;[21]And has no root in himself, but is for a time; and there being pressure or expulsion for the word, straightly is he offended.[22]And he having sown among thorns, this is he hearing the word; and the care of this time, and the deceit of riches, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.[23]But he having sown upon good earth is he hearing the word, and understanding; who indeed bears fruit, and who makes truly a hundred, and who sixty, and who thirty.[24]Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens was made like a man sowing good seed in his field:[25]And in men’s sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went away.[26]And when the grass sprouted up and made fruit, then appeared the tares also.[27]And the servants of the master of the house having come, said to him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field whence therefore has it tares?[28]And he said to them, A man, an enemy, has done this: and his servants said to him, Wilt thou therefore we, having departed, should gather them.[29]And he said, No; lest gathering the tares, ye root up the wheat together with them.[30]Suffer both to grow together till harvest; and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; and gather the wheat into my barn.[31]Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a kernel of mustard, which a man taking, sowed in his field:[32]Which truly is less than all seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than vegetables, and becomes a tree, so that the flying things of heaven come and lodge in its young shoots.[33]Another parable spake he to them; The kingdom of the heavens is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of wheaten flour, till the whole was leavened.[34]All these things spake Jesus in parables to the crowds; and without a parable spake he not to them.[35]So that that spoken by the prophet might be filled up; saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will declare things having been hid from the foundation of the world.[36]Then Jesus having dismissed the crowds, went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.[37]And he having answered, said to them, He sowing the good seed is the Son of man:[38]And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;[39]And the enemy having sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the end of time; and the reapers are the messengers.[40]As therefore the tares are gathered together and burnt in fire; so shall it be in the end of this time.[41]The Son of man shall send forth his messengers, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and those doing iniquity;[42]And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.[43]Then shall the just emit a brilliant light as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He having ears to hear, let him hear.[44]Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a treasure hid in the field; which a man finding, concealed, and from his joy, he retires, and all things which he has he sells, and he purchases that field.[45]Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, a wholesale merchant, seeking beautiful pearls:[46]Who, finding one pearl of great value, having departed, he sold all things which he had, and purchased it.[47]Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a large sweep-net, cast into the sea, and having gathered of every kind:[48]Which when it was filled, having raised up upon the shore, and having set down, they gathered the good things into vessels, and the rotten things they cast without.[49]So shall it be in the end of time; the messengers shall come forth, and separate the evil from the midst of the just,[50]And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.[51]Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these? They say to him, Yes, Lord.[52]And he said to them, Therefore every scribe, having been a disciple in the kingdom of the heavens, is like to a man, master of a house, who casts out from his treasure new things and old.[53]And it was when Jesus finished these parables, he removed thence.[54]And having come into his native land, he taught them in their assembly, so that they were struck with amazement, and said, Whence to him this wisdom, and powers?[55]Is not this the son of the carpenter? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?[56]And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then to him all these?[57]And they were scandalized in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not unhonoured, except in his native land, and in his house.[58]And he did not many powers there, because of their unbelief.","Matt.14":"[1]In that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report of Jesus,[2]And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; be was aroused from the dead; and for this, powers are energetic in him.[3]For Herod, having seized John, bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife:[4]For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her:[5]And wishing to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, because they held John as a prophet.[6]The festivities of Herod’s birthday being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.[7]Wherefore, with an oath, he agreed to give her whatever she should ask.[8]And having been urged on by her mother, Give me, she says, here upon a board, the head of John the Baptist.[9]And the king was grieved: but for his oath, and those reclining together at the table, he ordered to be given.[10]And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.[11]And his head was brought upon a board, and given to the girl, and she brought to her mother.[12]And his disciples having come near, took away the body, and interred it; and having come, they announced to Jesus.[13]And Jesus having heard, withdrew from thence into a desert place apart: and the crowds, having heard, followed him on foot from the cities.[14]And Jesus having come, saw a great crowd: and he felt compassion for them, and he cured their sick.[15]And being evening, his disciples came to him, saying, It is a desert place, and the time has passed already; loose the crowds, that, having gone into towns, they might purchase food for themselves.[16]But Jesus said to them, They have no need to depart; give ye them to eat.[17]And they say to him, We have not here but five loaves, and two fishes.[18]And he said, Bring them here to me.[19]And having encouraged the crowds to recline upon the grass, and having taken the five loaves, and two fishes, and having looked up to heaven, he praised; and having broken, gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.[20]And they all ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the remaining of fragments, twelve baskets full.[21]And they eating were five thousand men, besides women and children.[22]And quickly Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the ship, and to go before him to the other side, till he should loose the crowds.[23]And having loosed the crowds, he went up into a mount apart to pray: and being evening, he was there alone.[24]And the ship was already in the midst of the sea, overcharged by waves: for the wind was contrary.[25]And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking upon the sea.[26]And the disciples seeing him walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition; and they cried out for fear.[27]And quickly Jesus spake to them, saying, Take courage; I am; be not afraid.[28]And Peter having answered him, said, Lord, if thou art, encourage me to come upon the waters.[29]And he said, Come. And Peter having gone down from the ship, walked upon the waters, to go to Jesus.[30]And seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me.[31]And quickly Jesus, having stretched out the hand, laid hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, for what didst thou doubt?[32]And having gone into the ship, the wind ceased.[33]And they in the ship, having come, worshipped him, saying, Thou art truly the Son of God.[34]And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.[35]And the men of the place, having known him, sent into the whole country round about, and brought to him all those having evils:[36]And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were saved from danger.","Matt.15":"[1]Then came to Jesus from Jerusalem the scribes and Pharisees, saying,[2]Wherefore do thy disciples pass by the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.[3]And he, having answered, said to them, Wherefore do ye also pass by the command of God by your tradition.[4]For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, he calumniating father or mother, in death let him die.[5]And ye say, Whoever should say to father or mother, A gift, whatever thou shouldest be profited by me;[6]And should not honour his father or his mother. And ye have annulled the command of God by your tradition.[7]Hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,[8]This people draw near me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips; but their heart keeps off far from me.[9]But they worship me in vain, teaching doctrines the commands of men.[10]And having called the crowd, he said to them, Hear ye, and understand.[11]Not that coming into the mouth pollutes the man; but that going forth out of the mouth, this pollutes the man.[12]Then his disciples having come near, said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were scandalized?[13]And having answered, he said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.[14]Let them go: they are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.[15]And Peter, having answered, said to him, Explain to us this parable.[16]And Jesus said, Are ye also yet destitute of understanding?[17]Do ye not yet understand, that everything going into the mouth proceeds to the belly, and is cast out in the privy?[18]But the things going forth out of the mouth come from the heart, and these pollute the man.[19]For from the heart come forth evil reflections, slaughters, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, defamations:[20]These are the things polluting a man: but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not a man.[21]And Jesus, having gone forth from thence, withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.[22]And, behold, a woman, a Canaanite, having come forth from those boundaries, cried out to him, saying, Pity me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is badly possessed with an evil spirit.[23]And he answered her not a word. And his disciples, having come, asked him, saying, Loose her; for she cries out after us.[24]And he, having answered, said, I was not sent except to the sheep having been lost, of the house of Israel.[25]And she, having come, worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.[26]And he, having answered, said, It is not good to take the children’s bread, and cast it to the little dogs.[27]And she said, Yes, Lord; for the little dogs also eat from the crumbs falling from the table of their lord.[28]Then Jesus, having answered, said to her, O woman, great thy faith: let it be to thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.[29]And having passed from thence, Jesus came to the sea of Galilee; and having gone up into a mountain, he sat there.[30]And many crowds came to him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them at the feet of Jesus; and he cured them:[31]So that the crowds wondered, seeing the dumb speaking, the maimed sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they praised the God of Israel.[32]And Jesus having called his disciples, said, I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain with me three days, and they have nothing they could eat: and I will not leave them fasting, lest they be relaxed in the way.[33]And his disciples say to him, Whence to us, in a lonely place, so many loaves, to satisfy such a crowd?[34]And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.[35]And he encouraged the crowd to recline upon the earth.[36]And having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having returned thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.[37]And all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up that remaining of the fragments seven wicker baskets full.[38]And they eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.[39]And having loosed the crowds, he went into a ship, and came into the bounds of Magdala.","Matt.16":"[1]And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come, tempting, asked him to shew them a sign from heaven.[2]And he having answered, said to them, It being evening, ye say, Calm weather: for the heaven is fiery red.[3]And in the morning, Today, wintry weather: for heaven, being sad, is fiery red. Hypocrites, truly ye know to decide the face of heaven, but the signs of the times ye cannot.[4]An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given her, except the sign of Jonas the prophet. And having left them, he departed.[5]And his disciples having come to the other side, forgot to take loaves.[6]And Jesus said to them, Attend and keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.[7]And they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we took no loaves.[8]And Jesus having known, said to them, Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have taken no loaves.[9]Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of five thousand, and how many baskets ye took?[10]Nor the seven loaves of four thousand, and how many wicker baskets ye took?[11]How do ye not understand that I spake not to you concerning bread, to keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?[12]Then understood they that he spake, not to keep from the leaven of bread, but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.[13]And Jesus, having come into the parts of Caesarea of Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say me to be, the Son of Man?[14]And they said, Some, truly, John the Baptist: and others, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.[15]And he says to them, But whom say ye me to be?[16]And Simon Peter having answered, said, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.[17]And Jesus, having answered, said to him, Happy art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed to thee, but my Father, he in the heavens.[18]And I say to thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; and the gates of hell shall not overcome her.[19]And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens: and whatever thou shalt bind upon earth shall be bound in the heavens: and whatever thou shalt loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens.[20]Then he enjoined his disciples that they say to none that he is Jesus Christ.[21]From then Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must depart to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised in the third day.[22]And Peter having taken him, began to reproach him, saying, Be propitious to thyself, Lord: this shall not be to thee.[23]And having turned, he said to Peter, Retire behind me, Satan: thou art an offence, to me: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.[24]Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any wish to come after me, let him deny himself absolutely, and lift up his cross, and follow me.[25]For whoever should wish to save his life shall lose it: and whoever shall lose his soul for my sake shall find it.[26]For what is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, and injure his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?[27]For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his messengers; and then he will give back to each according to his deed.[28]Verily I say to you, Some are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.","Matt.17":"[1]And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart.[2]And he was transformed before them: and his face shone as the sun, and his garments were white as the light.[3]And, behold, Moses and Elias were seen to them, conversing with him.[4]And Peter, having answered, said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.[5]He yet speaking, behold, a shining cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented; hear ye him.[6]And the disciples, having heard, fell upon their face, and were greatly afraid.[7]And Jesus, having come, touched them, and said, Be raised, and be not afraid.[8]And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone.[9]And they, coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the sight to none, even till the Son of man rises from the dead.[10]And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?[11]And Jesus having answered, said to them, Elias truly comes first and will re-establish all things.[12]And I say to you, That Elias has already come, and they knew him not, but did by him whatever they would. So also the Son of man is about to suffer by them.[13]Then understood the disciples that he told them of John the Baptist.[14]And they having come to the crowd, there came to him a man, supplicating on his knees to him, and saying,[15]Lord, pity my son: for he is a lunatic, and suffers badly: for many times he falls into the fire, and many times into the water.[16]And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.[17]And Jesus, having answered, said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I endure you? bring him here to me.[18]And Jesus censured him; and the demon went forth out of him: and the child was cured from that hour.[19]Then the disciples having come to Jesus apart, said, Why could not we cast it out?[20]And Jesus said to them, For your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If ye have faith as a kernel of mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Go away from thence, and it shall go away; and nothing shall be impossible to you.[22]And they having returned into Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men:[23]And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised. And they were greatly grieved.[24]And they having come to Capernaum, they taking double drachmas came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay double drachmas?[25]He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What seems to thee, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take taxes or census? from their sons, or from strangers?[26]Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the children free.[27]But that we should not scandalize them, having gone to the sea, cast a fish hook, and lift up the fish coming up first, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a gold coin: having taken that, give to them for me and thee.","Matt.18":"[1]In that hour came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens?[2]And Jesus, having called a young child, set it in the midst of them,[3]And said, Truly I say to you, Except ye be turned, and become as young children, ye should not come into the kingdom of the heavens.[4]Whoever, therefore, should be humbled as this young child, the same is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens.[5]And whoever shall receive such a young child in my name, receives me.[6]And whoever should offend one of these little ones believing in me, it is profitable for him that the millstone of an ass be hung upon his neck, and he be sunk in the midst of the sea.[7]Woe to the world for offences I for there is necessity for offences to come; but woe to that man by whom the offence comes![8]And if thy hand or thy foot give thee cause of offence, cut them off, and cast from thee: it is good for thee to come into life lame or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.[9]And if thine eye give thee cause of offence, take it out, and east from thee: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to enter into life, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire.[10]See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That their messengers in the heavens always behold the face of my Father which is in the heavens.[12]What does it seem to you? if there be to any man a hundred sheep, and one of them have been led astray, does he not, having left the ninety-nine upon the mountains, having gone, seek the one led astray?[13]And if it be found, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over it, than over the ninety-nine not led astray.[14]So is not the will of your Father, he in the heavens, that one of these little ones be lost.[15]And if thy brother sin against thee, retire, and refute him between thee and him alone; if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.[16]But if he hear thee not, take with thee yet one or two, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might stand.[17]And if he refuse hearing them, speak to the church: and if he refuse hearing the church, let him be to thee as of the nations and a publican.[18]Truly I say to you, Whatever things ye should bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever things ye should loose upon earth shall be loosed in heaven.[19]Again, I say to you, That if two of you agree in opinion for everything which they ask, it shall be to them of my Father, he in the heavens.[20]For where two or three are assembled in my name, there am I in the midst of them.[21]Then Peter, having come to him, said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I let him go? Till seven times?[22]And Jesus says to him, I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven.[23]Therefore the kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, the king, who wished to lift up the word together with his servants.[24]And he having begun to settle accounts, one was brought him, a debtor of ten thousand talents.[25]And he not having to give back, his lord ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children, and all which he had also to be given back.[26]Then the servant, having fallen, worshipped him, saying, Lord, be slow to anger towards me, and I will give back all to thee.[27]And the lord of that servant, having felt compassion, loosed him, and let go to him the money lent.[28]But that servant having come, found one of his fellow-servants who owed him one hundred drachmas, and having seized, he choked him, saying, Give back to me what thou owest.[29]Then his fellow-servant having fallen at his feet besought him, saying, Be slow to anger towards me, and I will give back all to thee.[30]And he would not; but having departed he cast him into prison till he should give back that being owed.[31]And his fellow-servants having seen the thing done, were greatly grieved, and having come, made known to their lord all things done.[32]Then his lord, having called him, said unto him, O thou evil servant, I let go to you all that debt since thou besoughtest me:[33]Oughtest thou not also to pity thy fellow-servant, as I also pitied thee.[34]And his lord having become angry, delivered him to the torturers even till he should give back all being owed to him.[35]So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye let not go each to his brother from your hearts their falls.","Matt.19":"[1]And it was when Jesus finished these words he removed from Galilee, and came from the bounds of Judea beyond Jordan;[2]And many crowds followed him; and he cured them there.[3]And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to loose his wife for every cause.[4]And having answered, he said to them, Have ye not read, that he having made from the beginning, made them male and female,[5]And said, For this shall a man leave father and mother, and be joined to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?[6]So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has yoked together, let not man separate.[7]They say to him, Why then did Moses charge to give a writing of divorce, and loose her?[8]He says to them that Moses for your hard heart permitted you to loose your wives: and from the beginning it was not so.[9]And I say to you, That whoever should loose his wife, except for fornication, and marry another, commits adultery; and he having married the one loosed commits adultery.[10]His disciples say to him, If the cause of a man is so with the woman, it is not profitable to marry.[11]And he said to them, All have not room for this word, but to whom it is given.[12]For there are eunuchs, who were born so from the mother’s belly: and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of the heavens. He being able to receive, let him receive.[13]Then young children were brought to him, that he might put hands upon them and pray: and the disciples censured them.[14]But Jesus said, Let go the young children, and hinder them not, to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.[15]And having put hands upon them, he went out from thence.[16]And, behold, one having come said to him, Good teacher, what good shall I do, that I might have eternal life?[17]And he said to him, Why sayest thou me good? None is good except one, God; but if thou wouldst come into life, keep the commands.[18]He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, thus: Thou shalt not murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;[19]Honour thy father and mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.[20]The young man says to him, All these have I watched from my youth; what yet do I want?[21]Jesus said to him, If thou wished to be perfected, retire, sell thy possessions, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.[22]And the young man having heard the word, departed, being grieved: for he was holding many possessions.[23]And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, That with difficulty shall a rich one come into the kingdom of the heavens.[24]And again I say to you, It is of easier labor for a camel to pass through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.[25]And his disciples were greatly struck with amazement, saying, Who then can be saved?[26]And Jesus having looked up said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.[27]Then Peter having answered, said to him, Behold, we have let go all things, and have followed thee; what therefore shall be to us?[28]And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, That ye having followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man should sit upon the throne of his glory, shall be seated ye also upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.[29]And every one who lets go houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for the sake of my name, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.[30]And many first shall be last, and the last first.","Matt.20":"[1]For the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, master of a house, who went out as soon as morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.[2]And having agreed for a drachma a day, he sent them to his vineyard.[3]And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market-place,[4]And he says to them, Retire ye also into the vineyard, and whatever should be just I will give you: and they departed.[5]Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.[6]And about the eleventh hour, having gone out, he found others standing idle, and he says to them, Why stand ye here idle the whole day?[7]They say to him, That none has hired us. He says to them, Retire also to the vineyard; and whatever be just, ye shall receive.[8]And it being evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen, and give back to them the wages, beginning from the last even to the first.[9]And they of the eleventh hour having come, thereupon received a drachma.[10]And the first, having come, thought that they will receive more; and they also received thereupon a drachma.[11]And having received, they murmured against the master of the house,[12]Saying, That these last worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, having borne the burden and heat of the day.[13]And he, having answered, said to one of them, Friend, I injure thee not; didst not thou agree with me for a drachma?[14]Take thine and retire: and I will to give to this last, as also to thee.[15]Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my things? Or is thine eye evil because I am good.[16]So shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen.[17]And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and he said to them,[18]Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,[19]And they shall deliver him to the nations to mock, and scourge, and crucify: and he shall be raised the third day.[20]Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, worshipping, and asking something of him.[21]And he said to her, What wilt thou? She says to him, Say that these my two sons might sit, the one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.[22]And Jesus having answered, said, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink the cup which I am about to drink, and be immersed with the immersion which I am immersed? They say to him, We can.[23]And he says to them, Truly my cup shall ye drink, and with the immersion which I am immersed shall ye be immersed; but to sit on my right, and on my left, is not mine to give, but to those it was prepared for by my Father.[24]And the ten having heard, felt pain about the two brethren.[25]But Jesus, having called them, said, Ye know that the rulers rule over their nations, and the great exercise authority over them.[26]But it shall not be so among you; but whoever should wish to be great among you, let him be your attendant;[27]And whoever would be first among you, let him be your servant:[28]As the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul a ransom for many.[29]And they going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him.[30]And, behold, two blind sitting by the way, having heard that Jesus passes by, cried out, saying, Pity us, O Lord, son of David.[31]And the crowd censured them that they should be silent: but they cried the more, saying, Pity us, O Lord, son of David.[32]And Jesus having stood, called them, and said, What will ye I shall do to you?[33]They say to him, Lord, that our eyes might be opened.[34]And Jesus, having felt compassion, touched their eyes: and quickly their eyes looked up, and they followed him.","Matt.21":"[1]And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying to them,[2]Go ye into the town opposite to us, and quickly shall ye find an ass bound, and a colt with her; having loosed, bring to me.[3]And if any one say to you, Why? ye shall say, That the Lord has need of them; and quickly will he send them.[4]And the whole of this was, that that spoken by the prophet be completed; saying,[5]Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy king comes to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and a colt, son of a beast of burden.[6]And the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus commanded them,[7]Brought the ass, and colt, and put on them their garments, and he sat over them.[8]And a very great crowd strewed their garments in the way; and others cut down young shoots from the trees, and strewed in the way.[9]And the crowds leading before, and following, cried, saying, Osanna to the son of David: he coming in the name of the Lord being praised; Osanna in the highest ones.[10]And he having come to Jerusalem, all the city was shaken, saying, Who is this?[11]And the crowds said, This is Jesus, the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.[12]And Jesus came into the temple of God, and cast out all those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the money-changers tables, and the seats of those selling doves,[13]And he says to them, It was written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; and ye have made it a den of robbers.[14]And the blind and lame came to him in the temple; and he cured them.[15]And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things which he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Osanna to the son of David; they felt pain.[16]And they said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus says to them, Yes; have ye never read, That out of the mouths of young children and sucklings thou hast adjusted praise?[17]And leaving them, he went without the city, to Bethany; and lodged there.[18]And in the morn, having returned into the city, he hungered.[19]And having seen one fig tree by the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, except leaves only; and he says to it, Let no more fruit be from thee forever. And instantly the fig tree was dried up.[20]And the disciples, seeing, wondered, saying, How suddenly was the fig tree dried up![21]And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Truly I say to you, if ye have faith, and be not removed, ye shall do not only that of the fig tree, but also to this mountain, if ye should say, Be thou lifted up, and cast into the sea, it shall be.[22]And all things, whatever ye ask in prayer, believing, shall ye receive.[23]And to him, having come into the temple to him teaching, came the chief priests and elders of the people, saying, By what authority doest thou these? and who gave thee this authority?[24]And Jesus, having answered, said to them, I will also ask you one word, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these.[25]The baptism of John, whence was it of heaven or of men And they reasoned by themselves, saying, If we say, of heaven; he will say to us, Why, then, believed ye him not?[26]But if we say, of men; we fear the crowd; for all hold John as a prophet.[27]And having answered Jesus, they said, We know not. And he said to them, Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do these.[28]But what seems to you A man had two children; and having come to the first, he said, Child, retire today, work in my vineyard.[29]And he, having answered, said, I will not; but afterward, having felt regret, he departed.[30]And having come to the second, he said likewise. And he, having answered, said, I, Lord: and he departed not.[31]Which of the two did the father’s will? They say to him, The first. Jesus says to them, Truly I say to you, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.[32]For John came to you in the way of justice, and ye believed him not: and the publicans and harlots believed him; and ye, seeing, repented not afterwards, to believe him.[33]Hear another parable: A certain man was master of a house, who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and digged in it a winepress, and let it out to farmers, and went abroad:[34]And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his parts.[35]And the farmers having taken his servants, truly one they stripped, and one they killed, and one they stoned.[36]Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did to them likewise.[37]And afterwards he sent to them his son, saying, They will be changed by my son.[38]And the farmers, seeing the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and possess his inheritance.[39]And having taken, they cast out of the vineyard, and killed.[40]When, therefore, the lord of the vineyard should come, what will he do to those farmers?[41]They say to him, He will miserably destroy these wicked, and let out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons.[42]Jesus says to them, Have ye never read in the writings, The stone which the builders disapproved of, this was for the head of the corner? This was from the Lord, and it was wonderful in your eyes.[43]For this I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation doing its fruits.[44]And he falling upon this stone shall be crushed: but upon whomsoever it should fall, it shall winnow him.[45]And the chief priests and Pharisees, having heard his parable, knew that he spake of them.[46]And seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the crowd, since they held him as a prophet.","Matt.22":"[1]And Jesus, having answered, spake to them in parables, saying,[2]The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a nuptial feast for his son.[3]And he sent his servants to those having been called to the nuptial feast: and they would not come.[4]And again, he sent other servants, saying, Say to the called: Behold, I have prepared my supper; my bulls and stall-fed killed, and all prepared: come to the nuptials.[5]And they, not having heeded, departed, one truly to his own field, and one to his traffic:[6]And the rest, having seized his servants, were insolent, and killed them.[7]And the king, having heard, was angry, and having sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.[8]Then says he to his servants, Truly the nuptial feast is prepared, and those called were not worthy.[9]Go ye, therefore, to the passages of the ways, and as many as ye should find, call to the nuptial feast.[10]And those servants, having come to the ways, gathered together all, as many as they found, also both the evil and good, and the nuptial feast was filled with the reclining.[11]And the king, having come in to behold the reclining, saw there a man not clad with the garment of the wedding:[12]And he says to him, Friend, how camest thou in here, not having a garment of the nuptial feast? And he was muzzled.[13]Then said the king to his servants, Having bound his feet and hands, take him away, and cast ye him into outer darkness; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.[14]For many are called, and few chosen.[15]Then the Pharisees, having gone, took counsel how they might ensnare him in word.[16]And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and care is to thee for none; for thou lookest not to the face of men.[17]Therefore say to us, What seems to thee Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?[18]But Jesus, having known their evil, said, Why tempt ye me, hypocrites?[19]Show me the piece of money of tribute. And they brought him a drachma.[20]And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription?[21]They say to him, Caesar’s. Then says he to them, Give back then to Caesar the things of Caesar; and the things of God to God.[22]And having heard, they wondered, and having left him, they departed.[23]In that day the Sadducees came to him, they saying there is to be no rising up: and they asked him,[24]Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any one die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.[25]And with us were seven brethren: and the first, having married, died; and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother.[26]And likewise the second, and third, even till the seven.[27]And after all died also the woman.[28]Therefore in the rising up whose of the seven shall the woman be? for they all had her.[29]And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Ye are led astray, not having known the writings, nor the power of God.[30]For in the rising up they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the messengers of God in heaven.[31]And for the rising up of the dead, read ye not that spoken by God, saying,[32]I am God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.[33]And the crowds having heard, were astonished at his teaching.[34]And the Pharisees having heard that he muzzled the Sadducees, were gathered upon the same.[35]And one of them, skilled in the law, asked, tempting him, and saying,[36]Teacher, which the great command in the law?[37]And Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.[38]This is the first and the great command.[39]And the second like it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.[40]In these two commands hang the whole law and the prophets.[41]And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus asked them,[42]Saying, What seems to you about Christ? Whose son is he They say to him, David’s.[43]He says to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,[44]The Lord said to my Lord, Sit by my right, till I make thine enemies the footstool of my feet.[45]If, therefore, David calls him Lord, how is he his son.[46]And none could answer him a word, nor dared any one from that day to ask him any more.","Matt.23":"[1]Then spake Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples,[2]Saying, Upon Moses’ seat sat the scribes and Pharisees.[3]Therefore all whatever they say to you to keep, keep and do; and according to their works do not, for they say and do not.[4]For they bind loads heavy and difficult to carry, and put upon men’s shoulders; and with their fingers will they not move them.[5]And all their works do they, to be seen by men: and make broad their preservatives, and enlarge the border of their garments.[6]And love the first place at suppers, and the first seat in the assemblies,[7]And greetings in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.[8]And be ye not called Rabbi: for one is your guide, Christ; and all ye are brethren.[9]And call not your father upon earth: for one is your Father, which in the heavens.[10]Nor be ye called leaders, for one is your Leader, Christ.[11]And the greater of you shall be your servant.[12]And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whoever shall humble himself, shall be exalted.[13]Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye lock up the kingdom of the heavens before men: for ye come not in yourselves, neither those coming in, permit ye to come in.[15]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! for ye go about sea and dry land to make one proselyte, and when he should become, ye make him the son of hell, twofold more than you.[16]Woe to you blind guides, saying, Whoever should swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever should swear by the gold of the temple, he is indebted![17]Foolish and blind; for which is the greater, the gold, or the temple consecrating the gold?[18]And, Whoever should swear by the altar, it is nothing; and whoever should swear by the gift above it, he is indebted.[19]Foolish and blind: for which is the greater, the gift, or the altar, consecrating the gifts?[20]Therefore, he having sworn by the altar, swears by it, and by all above it.[21]And he having sworn by the temple, swears by it, and by him dwelling in it.[22]And he having sworn by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him sitting above it.[23]Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye exact tenths and dill and cummin, and ye have left the weightier things of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith: these it was necessary to do, and not to let go those.[24]Blind guides, straining a gnat, and swallowing down a camel.[25]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup, and the side dish of sweet-meats, and within they are full of pillage and bad mixture.[26]O blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup, and side dish of sweetmeats, that also their outside might be clean.[27]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whitewashed tombs, which without indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of the bones of the dead, and of all uncleanness.[28]So also ye without truly appear just to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.[29]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and deck the monuments of the just,[30]And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we had not been their partakers in the blood of the prophets,[31]Wherefore ye bear testimony to yourselves, that ye are the sons of those having slain the prophets.[32]And fill ye up yourselves the measure of your fathers.[33]Serpents, generations of vipers, how would ye flee from the judgment of hell?[34]Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and the wise, and scribes: and of them shall ye kill and crucify; and of them shall ye chastise in your assemblies, and drive out from city to city,[35]So that all the just blood shed upon the earth might come upon you, from the blood of just Abel to the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye killed between the temple and altar.[36]Truly I say to you, All these shall come upon this generation.[37]Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets, and stoning those sent to her; how often did I wish to gather thy children together, which manner a bird gathers together her young broods under the wings, and ye would not![38]Behold, your house is left to you desolate.[39]For I say to you, Ye should not see me from henceforth, till ye should say, Praised be he coming in the name of the Lord.","Matt.24":"[1]And Jesus having gone out, went out of the temple: and his disciples came near to shew him the buildings of the temple.[2]And Jesus said to them, See ye not all these? truly I say to you, Stone upon stone shall not be left here, which shall not be loosened.[3]And sitting upon the mount of Olives, his disciples came to him apart, saying, Say to us when these shall be, and what the sign of thy arrival, and the termination of the time.[4]And Jesus having answered, said to them, See lest any lead you astray.[5]For many shall come upon my name, saying, I am Christ; and deceive many.[6]And ye will be about to hear of wars and rumors of war: see, be not terrified; for all must be, but the end is not yet.[7]For nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and plagues, and shakings in places.[8]And all these the beginning of anguish.[9]Then shall they deliver you to pressure, and they shall kill you: and ye shall be hated by all nations, for my name.[10]And then shall many be offended, and they shall deliver up one another, and they shall hate one another.[11]And many false prophets shall be raised up, and deceive many.[12]And because anxiety shall increase, the love of many shall be cooled.[13]But he having persevered to the end, this shall be saved.[14]And this good news of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in the whole habitable globe for a witness to all nations: and then shall the end come.[15]Therefore, when ye see the abomination of devastation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let him reading, understand:)[16]Then let them in Judea flee to the mountain;[17]He upon the house-tops, let him not come down to take away anything out of his house:[18]And he in the field, let him not turn back to take up his garments:[19]And woe to those having in the womb, and to those giving suck, in those days![20]And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor in the sabbath.[21]For then shall be great pressure, such as has not been from the beginning of the world till now, nor should be.[22]And except those days had been shortened, no flesh should be saved: but for the chosen, those days shall be shortened.[23]Then if any say to you, Behold, here Christ, or there; believe ye not.[24]For false Christs, and false prophets, shall be raised up, and give great signs and wonders; so as to deceive, if possible, also the chosen.[25]Behold, I have told you beforehand.[26]If therefore they should say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth; Behold, in the store-houses, believe ye not.[27]For as the lightning comes forth from the sunrisings, and shines to the descents; so also shall be the arrival of the Son of man.[28]For wherever be the fall, there will the eagles be gathered together.[29]And quickly after the pressure of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken;[30]And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall the tribes of the earth lament bitterly, and they shall see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.[31]And he shall send his messengers, with the great voice of the trumpet, and they shall bring together his chosen from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to the extremities.[32]And from the fig tree learn a parable; When already her young shoot should be tender, and the leaves should spring forth, ye know that summer is near:[33]So also ye, when ye should see all these things, know ye that it is near at the doors.[34]Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, till all these things should be.[35]The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words should not pass away.[36]And concerning that day and hour, none know, nor the messengers of the heavens, except my Father only.[37]And as the days of Noe, so shall be the arrival of the Son of man.[38]For as they were in the days of the inundation, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noe came into the ark,[39]And knew not till the inundation came, and took them all away; so also shall be the arrival of the Son of man.[40]Then shall be two in the field; one shall be taken, and one is let go;[41]Two grinding in the mill; one shall be taken, and one let go.[42]Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord comes.[43]But know this, that if the master of the house had known what watch the thief comes, he had watched, and would not have suffered his house to be undermined.[44]Therefore be ye also prepared: for what hour ye think not, the Son of man comes.[45]Who then is the faithful and discerning servant, which his lord set over his attendance, to give them food in due season.[46]Happy that servant which his lord, having come, shall find doing thus.[47]Truly I say to you, That he shall set him over all his possessions.[48]But if that servant say in his heart, My lord delays to come;[49]And he should begin to strike the fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with those intoxicated;[50]The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he expects not, and in an hour which he knows not,[51]And he shall cut him in two equal parts, and he shall set his portion with the hypocrites: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Matt.25":"[1]Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who having taken their lanterns, went forth to the meeting of the bridegroom.[2]And five of them were discerning, and five foolish.[3]Those foolish having taken their lanterns, took no oil with them.[4]And the discerning took oil in their vessels with their lanterns.[5]And the bridegroom delaying, they all slumbered and slept.[6]And in the middle of the night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go ye forth to his meeting.[7]Then all these virgins were aroused, and put their lanterns in order.[8]And the foolish said to the discerning, Give us of your oil; for our lights are quenched.[9]And the discerning answered, saying, Lest it should not suffice us and you: but go ye rather to those selling, and buy for yourselves.[10]And they, going to buy, the bridegroom came; and they prepared, went in with him to the nuptials; and the door was locked.[11]And afterwards came also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.[12]And he having answered said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.[13]Watch, therefore, for ye know not the day, neither the hour, in which the Son of man comes.[14]For as a man going abroad, called his own servants, and delivered them his possessions:[15]And to one he truly gave five talents, and to one, two, and to one, one; to each according to his own power; and he quickly went abroad.[16]And he having received five talents, having gone, worked with them, and he made other five talents.[17]Likewise he having the two also, gained he also other two.[18]And he having received one, having departed, dug in the earth, and concealed his lord’s silver.[19]And after much time the lord of these servants comes, and lifts up the word with them.[20]And he having received the five talents, having come near, brought the other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst me five talents: and I have gained other five talents.[21]And his lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant: thou west faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.[22]And he also having received the two talents, having come near said, Lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; see, I gained two other talents to them.[23]His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.[24]And he also having received one talent, having come near, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou scatteredst not:[25]And having been afraid, having gone away, I concealed thy talent in the earth; see, thou hast thine own.[26]And his lord having answered, said to him, O evil and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I scattered not:[27]Thou therefore oughtest to have cast my silver to the money-changers, and I having come, had received mine own, with interest.[28]Therefore take the talent away from him, and give him having ten talents.[29]For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away.[30]And cast ye the useless servant into darkness without; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.[31]And when the Son of man should come in his glory, and all his holy messengers with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:[32]And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the kids.[33]And he shall set the sheep from his right, and the kids from his left.[34]Then shall the king say to them from his right, Come, the praised of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:[35]For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye brought me in:[36]Naked, and ye put around me: I was sick, and ye reviewed me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.[37]Then shall the just answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished or thirsting, and gave to drink.[38]And when saw we thee a stranger, and brought in or naked, and put around.[39]And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?[40]And the king having answered, will say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did to one of the least of my brethren, ye did to me.[41]Then shall he say to them from the left, Go away from me, the cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his messengers:[42]For I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;[43]I was a stranger and ye brought me not in; naked, and ye put not around me; sick, and in prison, and ye took not a view of me.[44]Then shall they answer him, they also saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and attended not to thee?[45]Then shall he answer them saying, Inasmuch as ye did not to one of the least of these, ye did not to me.[46]And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: and the just into eternal life.","Matt.26":"[1]And it was when Jesus finished all the words, he said to his disciples.[2]Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man shall be delivered to be crucified.[3]Then were gathered together the chief priests, and scribes, and the more ancient of the people, into the court-yard of the chief priest, called Caiaphas,[4]And they counselled together, that they might obtain Jesus by stratagem, and might kill.[5]And they said, Not in the festival, lest there should be an uproar among the people.[6]And Jesus having been in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leprous,[7]There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of costly perfumed ointment, and she poured upon the head of him, reclining at table.[8]And his disciples seeing, felt pain, saying, For what this loss?[9]For this perfumed oil could have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor.[10]And Jesus having known, said to them, Why offer ye toils to the woman? for a good work has she worked upon me.[11]For always the poor ye have with you, but me ye have not always.[12]For she, casting this perfumed oil upon my body, did to prepare me for interment,[13]Truly I say to you, Wheresoever this good news be proclaimed in the whole world, shall it also be spoken what she did, for a remembrance of her.[14]Then one of the twelve having gone forth, he being called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,[15]Said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? and they placed to him thirty silver coins.[16]And from then he sought opportunity, that he might deliver him.[17]And in the first of the unleavened loaves, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou we should prepare for thee to eat the pascha?[18]And he said, Retire ye into the city, to a certain person, and say to him, The teacher says, My time is near; with thee do I the pascha with my disciples.[19]And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them: and they prepared the passover.[20]And it being evening, he reclined at table with the twelve.[21]And they eating, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.[22]And they being greatly grieved, began each of them to say to him, Far from it am I, O Lord:[23]And he having answered, said, He having dipped with me the hand in the small dish, the same shall deliver me up.[24]Truly the Son of man retires as has been written concerning him; and woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! it was good for him if that man had not been born.[25]And Judas delivering him up, having answered, said, Far from it, am I, Rabbi? He said to him, Thou hast said.[26]And they eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and praised, brake and gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.[27]And having taken the cup, and given thanks, he gave to them, saying, Drink of it all ye.[28]For this is my blood, that of the new covenant, having been poured out for many, for the remission of sins.[29]And I say to you, that I drink not from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, even till that day when I drink it new with you, in the kingdom of my Father.[30]And having sung, they went forth to the mount of Olives.[31]Then says Jesus to them, All ye shall be scandalized in me this night; for it has been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered up and down.[32]And after I be raised, I will lead before you into Galilee.[33]And Peter having answered, said to him, And if all men shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.[34]Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee that in this night, before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.[35]Peter says to him, Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee: likewise also said all the disciples.[36]Then comes Jesus with them into the place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here, till I, having gone, shall pray.[37]And having taken Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved, and to be dejected.[38]Then says he to them, My soul is sorely grieved, even to death: remain here, and watch ye with me.[39]And having gone forward a little, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: but not as I will, but as thou.[40]And he comes to his disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, So were ye not able to watch with me one hour?[41]Watch and pray, lest ye come into temptation: truly the spirit of a ready will, and the flesh weak.[42]Again of a second time, having gone away, he prayed, saying, My Father if this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink it, let thy will be.[43]And having gone he finds them again sleeping: for their eyes were loaded.[44]And having left them, having gone away again, he prayed of the third time, speaking the same word.[45]Then comes he to his disciples, and says to them, Sleep for the remaining time, and take rest: behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of the sinful.[46]Be aroused, let us lead forth; behold, he delivering me up, has drawn near.[47]And he yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd, with swords, and sticks, from the chief priests, and the more ancient of the people.[48]And he delivering him up, gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, the same is he: hold him firmly.[49]And quickly having come to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.[50]And Jesus said to him, Friend, for what comest thou? Then having come near, they put hands upon Jesus, and held him firmly.[51]And, behold, one of them with Jesus, having stretched out the hand, pulled out his sword, having struck the chief priest’s servant, took away his ear.[52]Then says Jesus to him, Turn back thy sword to its place: for all they having taken the sword, shall perish by the sword.[53]Thinkest thou that I am not able to call to my Father for aid, and he will set before me more than twelve legions of messengers?[54]How then would the writings be filled up, that so it must be?[55]In that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, As against a robber came ye out, with swords and sticks, to take me? In the day I sat down with you, teaching, and ye took not hold of me.[56]But this has been wholly that the writings of the prophets might be filled up. Then all the disciples, having left him, fled.[57]And they having held Jesus, brought to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders were gathered together.[58]And Peter followed him from far, even to the court-yard of the chief priest, and having entered within, he sat with the attendants, to see the end.[59]And the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death;[60]And they found not: and many false witnesses having come near, they found not.[61]And afterwards two false witnesses, having come near, said, This said, I can loosen the temple of God, and after three days build it.[62]And the chief priest, having risen, said to him, Answerest thou nothing? what do these witness against thee?[63]But Jesus was silent. And the chief priest having answered, said to him, I cause thee to swear by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou art Christ, the Son of God.[64]And Jesus says to him, Thou hast said: but I say to you, from henceforth ye shall see the Son of man, sitting from the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.[65]Then the chief priest tore his garments, saying, That he blasphemed: what further need have we of witnesses? see, now ye have heard his blasphemy.[66]What seems to you? And they having answered, said, He is liable to the penalty of death.[67]Then did they spit in his face, and cuffed him, and struck him with a rod:[68]Saying, Prophesy to us, O Christ, Who is he having struck thee.[69]And Peter sat without in the court-yard, and one young girl came to him saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.[70]And he denied before all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.[71]And he having gone out into the gate, another saw him, and she says to them there, This also was with Jesus the Nazarite.[72]And again he denied with an oath, That I know not the man.[73]And a little after, those standing, having come near, said to Peter, Truly thou also art of them; for also thy speech makes thee manifest.[74]Then began he to anathematize, and to swear, That I know not the man: and quickly the cock uttered a sound.[75]And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, having said to him, That before the cock utter a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice. And having gone forth without, he wept bitterly.","Matt.27":"[1]And having been morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, to kill him:[2]And having bound they brought him away, and they delivered him to Pontius Pilate, the leader.[3]Then Judas, he delivering him up, having seen that he was condemned, having felt regret, returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests, and the more ancient,[4]Saying, I have sinned, having delivered up guiltless blood. And they said, What to us? thou shalt see.[5]And having cast down the silver coins in the temple, he withdrew and having gone away, he strangled him self.[6]And the chief priests, having taken the silver coins, said, It is not lawful to cast them for an offering, since it is the price of blood.[7]And having taken counsel, they purchased with them the potter’s field, for the interment to strangers.[8]Wherefore, that field was called, The field of blood, even to this day.[9]Then was completed that having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of him prized, whom they from the sons of Israel prized;[10]And they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.[11]And Jesus stood before the leader: and the leader asked him, saying, Art thou King of the Jews? Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.[12]And in the accusing him by the chief priests and the more ancient, he answered nothing.[13]Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not what they witness against thee?[14]And he answered him not to one word: so that the leader wondered greatly.[15]And in the festival the leader was accustomed to loose one imprisoned to the crowd, which they desired.[16]And they had then an imprisoned distinguished, called Barabbas.[17]Therefore they assembled together, Pilate laid to them, Whom will ye I shall loose to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, called Christ?[18]For he knew that through envy, they had delivered him, up.[19]And he sitting upon the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Nothing to thee and that just one: for I have suffered this day many things in a dream, on his account.[20]And the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.[21]And the leader having answered, said to them, Which of the two will ye I shall loose to you? And they said, Barabbas.[22]Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.[23]And the leader said, For what evil hath he done? and they cried excessively, saying, Let him be crucified.[24]And Pilate, seeing that it profits nothing, but there is rather an uproar, having taken water, he washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this just one: ye shall see yourselves.[25]And all the people having answered, said, His blood upon us, and upon our children.[26]Then he loosed to them Barabbas: and having scourged Jesus, delivered him up, that, he might be crucified.[27]Then the soldiers of the leader, having taken Jesus to the Pretorium, gathered together the whole band against him.[28]And having unclothed him, they put round him a scarlet, loose, warm cloak.[29]And having twined a crown of thorns, they put upon, his head: and a reed upon his right hand: and having fallen upon the knees before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews![30]And having spit upon him, they took the reed, and struck upon his head.[31]And when they mocked him, they put off from him the loose, warm cloak, and put on him his garments, and brought him away to crucify.[32]And coming, they found a man, a Cyrenian, Simon by name; they compelled him that he should lift up his cross.[33]And having come, to the place called Golgotha, which is called the place of the skull,[34]They gave him vinegar to drink. (mingled with bile: and having tasted, he would not drink.[35]And having crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lot: that that spoken by the prophet might be filled up: They divided among them my garments, and upon my clothing they cast lot.[36]And sitting down, they observed him there.[37]And they set above his head his accusation, having been written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.[38]Then were crucified with him two robbers; one from the right hand, and the other from the left.[39]And they coming near, blasphemed him, shaking their heads,[40]And saying, He loosing the temple, and building in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.[41]And likewise also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,[42]Others he saved; himself he cannot save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him:[43]He trusted upon God; let him now deliver him, if he desires him: for he said, That I am the Son of God.[44]And the robbers crucified with him, reproached him with the same.[45]And from the sixth hour, darkness was upon all the earth, even to the ninth hour.[46]And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a great voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani I this is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?[47]And some of them standing there, having heard, said, That he calls Elias.[48]And quickly one of them, having run, and taken a sponge, and filled with vinegar, and put upon a reed, gave him to drink.[49]And the rest said, Let go: we should see if Elias comes, going to save him.[50]And Jesus, again having cried with a great voice, let go the spirit.[51]And, behold, the covering of the temple was cleft in two, from above to below; and the earth was shaken; and the rocks were cleft:[52]And the tombs were opened: and many bodies of the holy ones, having been set to sleep, were raised,[53]And having come forth from the tombs, after his arising, went into the holy city, and were exhibited to many.[54]And the centurion, and they with him, observing Jesus, having seen the shaking, and the things having been, were greatly afraid, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.[55]And many women were there, beholding from far off, who followed Jesus out of Galilee, serving him:[56]Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.[57]And being evening, then there came a rich man from Arimathea, Joseph by name, who also himself was a disciple to Jesus:[58]He having come to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be given back.[59]And Joseph having taken the body, inwrapped it in clean fine linen:[60]And put it in his new tomb, which he quarried in the rock: and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he departed.[61]And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.[62]And in the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate.[63]Saying, Lord, we remember that that impostor said, yet living, After three days, I arise.[64]Order therefore, the tomb to be rendered secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, should steal him, and say to the people, He was raised from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.[65]And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: retire, render secure as ye know.[66]And they, having gone, rendered the tomb secure, having sealed the stone with the watch.","Matt.28":"[1]And after the sabbaths, in the shining forth to one of the sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to behold the tomb.[2]And, behold, there was a great shaking; for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come near, rolled away the stone from the door, and sat above it.[3]And his aspect was as lightning, and his garment white as snow.[4]And from fear of him the keepers were shaken, and were as dead.[5]And the messenger, having answered, said to the women, Be ye not afraid; for I know that ye seek Jesus, having been crucified.[6]He is not here: for he was raised, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.[7]And having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he was raised from the dead; and, behold, he leads before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him: behold I have said to you.[8]And they having come quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, ran to announce to his disciples.[9]And as they were going to announce to his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice ye. And they having come, held his feet firmly, and worshipped him.[10]Then says Jesus to them, Be ye not afraid: retire, and announce to my brethren that they should go away into Galilee, and there shall they see me.[11]And they going, behold certain of the watch having come to the city, announced to the chief priests all having been done.[12]And having been gathered together with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave sufficient silver coins to the soldiers,[13]Saying, Say ye, That his disciples having come by night, stole him, we being asleep.[14]And if this should be beard by the leader, we will persuade him, and we will make you undisturbed.[15]And they having received the silver coins, did as they were taught; and this word was spread a report by the Jews till this day.[16]And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, into a mountain, where Jesus commanded them:[17]And having seen him, they worshipped him; and some doubted.[18]And Jesus, having come near, spake to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth:[19]Therefore, having gone, disciple all nations; immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:[20]Teaching them to keep all things whatever I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days, even to the end of time. Amen.","Mark.1":"[1]The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.[2]As it has been written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.[3]A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his beaten paths straight.[4]John was immersing in the desert, and proclaiming the immersion of repentance for the remission of sins.[5]And the Judean country, and the Jerusalemites, were going out to him, and all were being immersed by him in the river Jordan, acknowledging their sins.[6]And John was dressed in camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and eating locusts and wild honey;[7]And he proclaimed, saying, The stronger than I comes after me, of whom I am not sufficient, having bent the head, to loose the strings of his shoes.[8]I truly immersed you in water: but he shall immerse you with the Holy Spirit.[9]And it was in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in Jordan.[10]And quickly coming up from the water, he saw the heavens cleft asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him:[11]And a voice was from the heavens; Thou art my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.[12]And directly the Spirit casts him, out into the desert.[13]And he was there in the desert forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with wild beasts; and messengers were serving him.[14]And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God,[15]And saying, That the time has been completed, and the kingdom of God has drawn near: repent ye, and believe in the good news.[16]And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a large sweep-net in the sea: for they were fishermen.[17]And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you to become fishermen of men.[18]And quickly having left their nets, they followed him.[19]And having moved forward a little from thence, he saw James of Zebedee, and John his brother, and they in the ship adjusting their nets.[20]And quickly he called them: and having left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hirelings; they went after him.[21]And they go into Capernaum; and quickly in the sabbaths, having entered into the synagogue, he taught.[22]And they were struck with amazement at his teaching; for he was teaching them as having power, and not as the scribes?[23]And there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, saying,[24]Let alone; what to us and thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy of God.[25]And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him.[26]And the unclean spirit having torn him, and having cried with a great voice, came out of him.[27]And all were amazed, so as to seek out with themselves, saying, What is this? what new teaching this? for with power also he commands the unclean spirits, and they listen to him.[28]And a report of him went out quickly in the whole country about Galilee.[29]And quickly, having come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.[30]And Simon’s mother-in-law was laid down, affected with fever: and quickly they speak to him concerning her.[31]And having come, he raised her, having held her hand; and the fever quickly left her, and she served them.[32]And evening having come, when the sun set, they brought to him all being afflicted, and the possessed with a demon.[33]And the whole city was gathered together at the door.[34]And be cured many afflicted with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and permitted not the devils to speak, for they knew him.[35]And early, having risen far in the night, he went out, and departed into a deserted place, and there prayed.[36]And Simon, and they with him, followed him.[37]And having found him, they say to him, That all seek thee.[38]And he says to them, We should lead into the next small cities, that I might proclaim there also: for, for this have I come forth.[39]And he was proclaiming in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.[40]And a leprous one came to him, beseeching him, and supplicating him on his knees, and saying to him, That if thou wouldst, thou canst cleanse me.[41]And Jesus, having felt compassion, having stretched out the hand, touched him, and says to him, I will: be thou cleansed.[42]And he having spoken, quickly the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.[43]And having threatened him violently, quickly he cast him forth:[44]And says to him, See thou say nothing to any one: but retire, shew thyself to the priest, and bring forward for thy cleansing what things Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.[45]And he, having gone forth, began to proclaim many things, and to spread the word a report, so that he could no more openly enter the city, but was without in desert places: and they come to him from every quarter.","Mark.2":"[1]And again he went into Capernaum after the days; and it was heard that he is in the house.[2]And quickly many were gathered together, so as no more to have room, neither at the door: and he spake the word to them.[3]And they come to him, bringing a paralytic, lifted up by four.[4]And not being able to draw near to him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was and having excavated, they let down his couch upon which the paralytic was laid.[5]And Jesus having seen their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins have been remitted to thee.[6]And certain of the scribes were sitting there, and discussing in their hearts,[7]Why does this thus speak blasphemies? who can remit sins but the one God.[8]And Jesus quickly having known that they discuss in themselves, says to them, Why discuss ye these things in your hearts.[9]Why is it easier to say to the paralytic, Sins have been remitted to thee? or to say, Arise, lift up thy couch, and walk?[10]And that ye might know that the Son of man has power to remit sins upon earth, (he says to the paralytic)[11]I say to thee, Arise, and lift up thy couch, and retire to thy house.[12]And he was quickly raised up; and having lifted up the couch, he went forth before all, so that all were affected in mind, and praised God, saying, That we never saw it thus.[13]And he went out again by the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.[14]And passing by, he saw Levi, him of Alpheus, sitting by the customhouse, and he says to him, Follow me. And having risen, he followed him.[15]And it was in his reclining at table in his house, and many publicans and sinful reclined together with Jesus and his disciples: for they were many, and they followed him.[16]And the scribes and Pharisees having seen him eating with publicans and sinful, said to his disciples, Why does he eat and drink with publicans and sinful?[17]And Jesus having heard, says to them, They being strong have no need of a physician, but those being affected: I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.[18]And the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees fast, and the disciples to thee fast not?[19]And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the nuptial chamber, in which the bridegroom is with them, fast? as much time as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.[20]And the days shall come when the bridegroom should he taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.[21]And none sews a piece of uncombed fragment upon an old garment; and lest its new filling up take away from the old, and the splitting be worse.[22]And none puts new wine in old wine-skins: and lest the new wine rend the wine-skins, and the wine be poured out, and the wine-skins perish; but they put new wine in new wine-skins.[23]And it was he passed by through the standing corn in the sabbaths: and his disciples began to make the way, picking out the ears of corn.[24]And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they in the sabbaths what is not lawful.[25]And he said to them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and hungered, himself, and those with him?[26]How he went into the house of God to Abiathar the chief priest, and ate the loaves of setting up, which is not lawful to eat but for priests, and gave to those being with him?[27]And he said to them, The sabbath was for man, and not man for the sabbath:[28]Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.","Mark.3":"[1]And he went again into the synagogue; and a man was there having the hand dried up.[2]And they were observing him narrowly, if in the sabbaths he will heal him; that they might accuse him.[3]And he says to the man having the hand dried up, Rise in the midst.[4]And he says to them, Is it lawful in the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? to save a soul, or to kill? And they were silent.[5]And having looked round upon them with anger, grieved for the hardness of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.[6]And the Pharisees having come out, quickly with the Herodians were making counsel against him, that they might destroy him.[7]And Jesus withdrew with, his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,[8]And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what he did, came to him.[9]And he said to his disciples, that a small vessel should remain for him, on account of the crowd, that they might not press him.[10]For he cured many; so as to fall upon him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.[11]And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell before him, and cried, saying, That thou art the Son of God.[12]And he censured them much, lest they should make him manifest.[13]And he goes up to a mountain, and calls whom he would: and they came to him.[14]And he made the twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to proclaim,[15]And have power to cure diseases, and cast out demons:[16]And he set to Simon the name Peter;[17]And James, him of Zebedee, and John brother of James; and he set to them names Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:[18]And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James him of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,[19]And Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.[20]And they came into the house; and again came the crowd together, so that they could not even eat bread.[21]And they with him, having heard, came forth to take hold of him: for they said, That he is affected in mind.[22]And the scribes, they having come down from Jerusalem, said, That he has Beelzeboul, and that by the ruler of demons he casts out demons.[23]And having called them, in parables spake he to them, How can Satan cast out Satan.[24]And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.[25]And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.[26]And if Satan rise up against himself, and has been divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.[27]None can plunder the vessels of the strong, having entered his house, except he first bind the strong; then he will plunder his house.[28]Truly I say to you, That all sins shall be remitted to the sons of men, and defamations whatever they defame:[29]And whoever should defame against the Holy Spirit has no remission forever, but he is liable to the penalty of eternal condemnation.[30]For they said, He has an unclean spirit.[31]Then came his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, they sent to him, calling him.[32]And the crowd sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek thee.[33]And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, and my brethren?[34]And having looked round upon those sitting round about him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren![35]For whoever should do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.","Mark.4":"[1]And again he began to teach by the sea: and a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that he, having gone into the ship, sat in the sea; and all the crowd was by the sea upon land.[2]And he taught them in parables many things, and said to them in his teaching,[3]Hear ye; behold, he sowing went out to sow:[4]And it was in sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things of heaven came and ate it down.[5]And other fell upon stony places, where it had not much earth; and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no deepness of earth:[6]And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and because it had no root, it was dried up.[7]And other fell in thorns, and the thorns came up, and choked it, and it gave no fruit.[8]And other fell in good earth, and gave fruit coming up and increasing; and one brought thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.[9]And he said to them, He having ears to hear, let him hear.[10]And when he was alone, they about him with the twelve asked him of the parable.[11]And he said to them, To you has it been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those without, all are in parables:[12]That seeing they might see, and not know; and hearing they might hear, and not understand; lest they turn back, and their sins be remitted to them.[13]And he says to them, Know ye not this parable? and how will ye know all parables?[14]He sowing sows the word.[15]And these are they by the way, where the word is sown; and when they hear, quickly comes Satan, and takes away the word sown in their hearts.[16]And these are likewise they sown upon stony places; who, when they hear, quickly with joy receive it;[17]And have no root in themselves, but are temporary; then pressure having been or expulsion for the word, quickly are they scandalized.[18]And these are they sown in thorns; these are they hearing the word.[19]And the cares of this time, and the deceit of riches, and eager desires about remaining things, coming in, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.[20]And these are they sown on good earth; who hear the word, and receive, and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.[21]And he said to them, Much less the light comes that it be set under a bushel, or under a bed; that it be not set upon a candlestick.[22]For not anything is hid, which should not be manifested; neither was concealed, but that it should come clear.[23]Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.[24]And he said to them, See ye how ye hear: with what measure ye measure, shall be measured to you: and to you hearing, shall be added.[25]For whoever should have, to him shall be given: and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.[26]And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;[27]And he sleep, and should rise night and day, and the seed should sprout, and be raised; how, he knows not.[28]For the earth bears fruit spontaneously; first the grass, then the ear, then the full wheat in the ear.[29]But when the fruit should yield, quickly he sends the sickle, for the harvest is brought forward.[30]And he said, To what should we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable should we hold it forth?[31]As a kernel of mustard, which, when it be sown in the earth, is smaller than all seeds upon the earth:[32]And when it be sown, it comes up and is greater than all vegetables, and makes great young shoots; so that the flying things of heaven can encamp under its shadow.[33]And with many such parables spake he the word to them, as they were able to hear.[34]And without a parable spake he not to them: and apart, he solved all to his disciples.[35]And he says to them in that day, being evening, Let us go beyond.[36]And having let the crowd go, they receive him as he was in the ship. And there were also other small vessels with him.[37]And there is a great hurricane of wind, and the waves struck against the ship, so that it was already filled.[38]And he was upon the back part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow: and they aroused him, and say to him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?[39]And having risen, he censured the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent, be constricted. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.[40]And he said to them, Why are ye so timorous? how have ye not faith?[41]And they feared a great fear, and said to one another, Who is this, that also the wind and sea listen to him.","Mark.5":"[1]And they went beyond the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.[2]And to him coming out of the ship, quickly a man met him from the monuments with an unclean spirit,[3]Who had a dwelling among the monuments; and neither with chains could any one bind him:[4]For he had been bound many times with fetters and chains, and the chains were torn asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and none could tame him.[5]And always, night and day, was he in the mountains, and among the monuments, crying, and mangling himself with stones.[6]And having seen Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him.[7]And having cried with a great voice, he said, What to me and thee, Jesus, O Son of God most high I adjure thee by God, that thou torture me not.[8]For he said to him, Come forth out of the man, thou unclean spirit.[9]And he asked him, What the name to thee? And he answered, saying, My name, Legion: for we are many.[10]And he besought him much that he would not send them out of the country.[11]And a great herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains.[12]And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we might enter into them.[13]And quickly Jesus permitted them. And the evil spirits having come forth, entered into the swine: and the herd rushed through the precipice into the sea, (and they were about two thousand;) and they were choked in the sea.[14]And those feeding the swine fled, and they announced in the city, and in the fields. And they came forth to see what is it that was done.[15]And they come to Jesus, and they see him possessed with the demon, sitting down, and being clothed, and of sound mind: and they were afraid.[16]And they having seen, recounted to them how it was to him possessed with the demon, and concerning the swine.[17]And they began to beseech him to depart out of their bounds.[18]And he having gone into the ship, he having been possessed with a demon besought him that he might be with him.[19]And Jesus permitted him not; but he says to him, Retire to thy house, to thine own, and announce to them what things the Lord did to thee, and he pitied thee.[20]And he went away, and began to proclaim in Decapolis what Jesus did to him: and all were wondering.[21]And Jesus having passed over again in the ship on the other side, a great crowd was gathered together to him: and he was by the sea.[22]And, behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue comes, Jairus by name; and having seen him, he fell at his feet,[23]And he besought him much, saying, That my little daughter is at the last extremity: that, having come, thou Mightest put the hands upon her, so that she might be saved; and she shall live.[24]And he went away with him; and a great crowd followed him, and they pressed him.[25]And a certain woman, being in a flowing of blood twelve years,[26]And having suffered many things by many physicians, and having expended all of her own, and not having been benefited, but having come rather to the worse,[27]Having heard concerning Jesus, having come in the crowd behind, she touched his garment.[28]For she said, That if I touch his garment, I shall be saved.[29]And quickly the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she knew in the body that she is healed from the plague.[30]And Jesus, having quickly known in himself the power having gone out of him, having turned round in the crowd, he said, Who has touched my garments?[31]And his disciples said to him, Seest thou the crowd pressing thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me?[32]And he looked round about to see her having done this.[33]And the woman, afraid and trembling, having known what bad been upon her, came and fell down before him, and spake all the truth to him.[34]And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has saved thee; retire in peace, and be whole from thy plague.[35]He yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue, saying, That thy daughter is dead: why yet dost thou importune the Teacher?[36]And Jesus having quickly heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.[37]And he permitted not any to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.[38]And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees an uproar, they weeping and wailing much.[39]And having time in, he says to them, Why make ye an uproar, and weep? the young child is not dead, but sleeps.[40]And they laughed at him. And he, having cast them all out, takes the father and mother of the young child, and those with him, and goes where the young child was lying.[41]And having taken the hand of the young child, he says to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Little girl, I say to thee, arise.[42]And the little girl arose quickly, and walked; for she was of twelve years. And they were affected in mind with great amazement.[43]And he charged them much that none should know this thing; and he spake to give her to eat.","Mark.6":"[1]And he came out thence, and came to his native land; and his disciples follow him.[2]And sabbath having come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing were struck with amazement, saying, Whence to this one these things? and what this wisdom given to him, that such powers are done by his hands?[3]Is not this the carpenter, son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Jude, and Simon and are not his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in him.[4]And Jesus said to them, That a prophet Is not unhonoured, except in his native land, and in kinsmen, and in his house.[5]And he could do no power there, except having laid his hands upon a few sick, he cured.[6]And he wondered for their unbelief. And he went about the towns teaching.[7]And he calls the twelve, and began to send them, two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;[8]And enjoined them, that they take nothing for the way, except a rod only; no traveling-sack, no bread, no brass in the purse:[9]But bound with sandals; and not clothed with two coats.[10]And he said to them, Wherever ye come into a house, there remain ye even till ye should come forth thence.[11]And as many as receive you not, nor hear you, going out thence, shake off the heap of dust under your feet for testimony to them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more supportable for the Sodomites or Gomorrhites in the day of judgment, than that city.[12]And having gone out, they proclaimed that they repent.[13]And they cast out many demons, and anointed many sick with oil, and they were cured.[14]And king Herod heard his name; (for it was manifest:) and said, That John the Immerser was raised from the dead, and for this the powers were energetic in him.[15]Others amid, That he is Elias. And others said, That he is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.[16]And Herod, having heard, said, That John whom I beheaded, this is he; he was raised from the dead.[17]For this Herod, having sent, took John, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife: for he married her.[18]For John said to Herod, That it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.[19]And Herodias had a grudge against him, and desired to kill him; and could not:[20]For Herod feared John, knowing him a just and holy man, and he observed him: and having heard him, did many things, and heard him cheerfully.[21]And a convenient day having come, when Herod in the festivities of his birthday made a supper to his leading persons, and to the captains of thousands, and to the first of Galilee;[22]And the daughter of this Herodias, having come in, and danced, and pleased Herod and those reclining together at table, the king said to the little girl, Ask me whatever thou wishest, and I will give thee.[23]And he swore to her, That whatever thou shouldest ask, I will give thee, even to half my kingdom.[24]And she having come out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Immerser.[25]And having come quickly with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I wish that thou wouldest give me by itself, upon a board, the head of John the Immerser.[26]And the king having been sorely grieved on account of the oaths and those reclining at table together, wished not to refuse her.[27]And quickly the king, having sent a scout, commanded his head to be brought:[28]And he having departed, beheaded him in prison, and brought his head upon a board, and gave it to the little girl: and the little girl gave it to her mother.[29]And his disciples, having heard, came and took up his corpse, and put it in a tomb.[30]And the sent are gathered to Jesus, and announced to him all things, whatever they did, and whatever they taught.[31]And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart to a desert place, and rest a little: for many were coming and returning, and neither had they leisure to eat.[32]And they departed to a desert place by ship apart.[33]And the crowds saw them retiring, and many knew him, and they were running there on foot from all cities, and came before them, and came together to him.[34]And Jesus, having come out, saw a great crowd, and felt compassion for them, for they were as sheep having not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.[35]And having been already much time, his disciples, having come to him, say, This is a desert place, and already the time much:[36]Loose them, that having departed to the fields and towns round about, they might buy to themselves loaves: for they have nothing they might eat.[37]And having answered, he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Having gone, should we buy loaves of two hundred drachmas, and give them to eat?[38]And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? retire and see. And having known, they say, Five, and two fishes.[39]And he commanded them all to recline a drinking together, drinking together upon the green grass.[40]And the borders, the borders reclined, by one hundred, and by fifty.[41]And having taken the five loaves and two fishes, having looked up to heaven, he praised, and he brake the loaves, and gave to his disciples that they might set before them; and the two fishes he divided to all.[42]And they all ate, and were satisfied.[43]And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of fishes.[44]And they eating the loaves were about five thousand men.[45]And quickly he constrained his disciples to go to the ship, and to lead before to the other side of Bethsaida, till he loose the crowd:[46]And having dismissed them, he went away to the mount to pray.[47]And evening having come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon land.[48]And he saw them trying to urge forward, for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking upon the sea, and he would pass by them.[49]And having seen him walking upon the sea, they thought it was an apparition, and cried out:[50]For all saw him, and were troubled. And quickly he spake with them, and says to them, Take courage: I am; be not afraid.[51]And he went up to them to the ship; and the wind ceased, and they were greatly affected in mind above measure and wondered.[52]For they understood not the loaves; for their heart was hardened.[53]And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and put into a harbor.[54]And they having come out of the ship, quickly having known him.[55]Running round about that whole country, began to bring the afflicted upon couches, where they heard that he is there.[56]And wherever he went, in towns, or cities; or fields, they set the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might even touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were saved.","Mark.7":"[1]And the Pharisees are gathered together to him, and certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,[2]And having seen some of his disciples with common hands, that is, unwashed, eating loaves, they rebuked.[3](For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.[4]And from the market-place, except they be immersed, they eat not. And there are many other things which they received to hold; the immersion of cups, and of measures, and of brazen vases, and of chairs.)[5]Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Wherefore do not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?[6]And he having answered, said to them, That Esaias prophesied well concerning you, as it has been written, This people honour me with lips, and their heart keeps far from me.[7]And in vain they revere me, teaching doctrines the commands of men.[8]For having left the command of God, ye hold firmly to the tradition of men, the immersion of measures and cups: and many other such like things ye do.[9]And he said to them, Well do ye abrogate the command of God, that ye might keep your tradition.[10]For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and he reviling father or mother, in death let him die:[11]And ye say, If a man say to father or mother, Corban, which is, a gift, whatever thou be profited by me;[12]And ye permit him to do nothing more for his father or his mother.[13]Abrogating the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.[14]And having called all the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all ye, and do ye understand:[15]There is nothing from without a man, entering into him, which can defile him: but things coming out from him, these are the things polluting the man.[17]And when he came into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him of the parable.[18]And he says, So are ye also without understanding? Do ye not perceive, that anything from without entering into a man, cannot pollute him.[19]For it goes not into the heart, but into the belly, and goes forth into the privy, purging all food.[20]And he said, That going out of a man, that pollutes a man.[21]For within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil reflections, adulteries, fornications, murders,[22]Thefts, overreaching, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, defamation, pride, foolishness:[23]All these evils go out from within, and pollute a man.[24]And arising from thence, he departed into the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, and having come into the house, he would have none know; and he could not be hid.[25]For a woman having heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet:[26]And the woman was a Grecian, a Syrophenician by birth; and she entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.[27]And Jesus said to her, Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not good to take the children’s bread, and cast to little dogs.[28]And she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord: for also the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.[29]And he said to her, For this word retire; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.[30]And having departed to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter cast upon the bed.[31]And again, having gone out from the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.[32]And they bring to him a deaf one, tongue-tied; and they beseech him that he would put the hand upon him.[33]And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers in his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue;[34]And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened.[35]And quickly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake rightly.[36]And he charged them that they should say to none: and as much as he charged them, they proclaimed more abundantly;[37]And above measure were they struck with amazement, saying, Well has he done all things: he makes the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.","Mark.8":"[1]In those days the crowd being very many, and having nothing they might eat, Jesus having called his disciples, says to them,[2]I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain three days with me, and have nothing they might eat:[3]And if I loose them fasting to their house, they will be relaxed in the way: for some of them have come from far.[4]And his disciples answered him, Whence might anyone be able to satisfy these with loaves here in the lonely place?[5]And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.[6]And he enjoined to the crowd to recline upon the earth: and having taken the seven loaves, having returned thanks, he brake, and he gave to his disciples that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.[7]And they had a few little fishes: and having praised, he spake to set them also before.[8]And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the remains of the fragments, seven wicker baskets.[9]And they eating were about four thousand: and he loosed them.[10]And quickly having gone into the ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.[11]And the Pharisees came out, and began to search out with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.[12]And having sighed deeply in spirit, he says, Why seeks this generation for a sign Verily I say to you, shall a sign be given to this generation.[13]And having let them go, having gone again into the ship, he departed beyond.[14]And they forgot to take loaves, and had not but one loaf with them in the ship.[15]And he enjoined them, saying, See ye, look away from the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.[16]And they reasoned with one another, saying, Because we have no loaves.[17]And Jesus having known, says to them, Why reason ye with yourselves, because ye have no loaves? observe ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?[18]Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and remember ye not?[19]When I brake the five loaves to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.[20]And when the seven to four thousand, the fillings of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.[21]And he said to them, How do ye not understand.[22]And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring to him one blind, and beseech him that he would touch him.[23]And having taken the hand of the blind, he led him forth without the town; and having spit into his eyes, having put hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing.[24]And having looked up, he said, I see men that I see as trees, walking.[25]Then again he put hands upon his eyes, and made him look up; and he was restored, and he saw all clearly.[26]And he sent him to his house, saying, Thou shouldest not either enter into the town, neither, say to any in the town.[27]And Jesus went out, and his disciples, to the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples in the way, saying to them, Whom do men say me to be?[28]And they answered, John the Immerser: and some, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.[29]And he says to them, And whom do ye say me to be? And Peter, having answered, says to him, Thou art Christ.[30]And he rebuked them, that they should say to none concerning him.[31]And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise up.[32]And he spake the word with frankness. And Peter having taken him, began to rebuke him.[33]And he having turned back, and having seen his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Retire behind me, Satan: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.[34]And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wills to come after me, let him absolutely deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.[35]For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever should lose his life for my sake and the good news, the same shall save it.[36]For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and injure his soul.[37]Or what shall a man give for the exchange of his soul?[38]For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; also the Son of man shall be ashamed of him, when he should come in the glory of the Father with the holy messengers.","Mark.9":"[1]And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That some of those are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God having come in power.[2]And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart alone: and he was transformed before them.[3]And his garments were shining, exceeding white, such as no fuller on earth can make white.[4]And Elias was seen to them, with Moses: and they were speaking together with Jesus.[5]And Peter having answered, says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.[6]For he knew not what he said; for they were terrified.[7]And a cloud was overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear ye him.[8]And suddenly, having looked around, they no more saw any one, but Jesus alone with them.[9]And they coming down from the mount, he charged them that they recount to none what they saw, except when the Son of man should arise from the dead.[10]And they held the word firmly to themselves, searching out together what it is to arise from the dead.[11]And having asked him, saying, That the scribes say that Elias must first come.[12]And he having answered, said to them, Elias truly having first come, restores all things; and how it has been written of the Son of man, that he suffer many things; and be set at nought.[13]But I say to you, that Elias also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it has been written of him.[14]And having come to the disciples, he saw a great crowd about them, and the scribes seeking out with them.[15]And immediately all the crowd; having seen him, were amazed, and running near greeted him.[16]And he asked the scribes, What seek ye together with them?[17]And one from the crowd having answered, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a speechless spirit.[18]And wherever he overtakes him, he rends him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is dried up: and I spake to thy disciples that they might cast him out; and they could not.[19]And he having answered, says to him, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.[20]And they brought him to him: and having seen him, quickly the spirit rent him; and having fallen upon the earth, foaming he rolled himself about.[21]And he asked his father, How long is it that this has been to him? And he said, From childhood.[22]And many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst anything, help us, having had compassion upon us.[23]And Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things possible to him believing.[24]And quickly the child’s father having cried out with tears, said, I believe, O Lord, help thou mine unbelief.[25]And Jesus, having seen that the crowd ran together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Speechless and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and that thou come no more into him.[26]And having cried and rent him much, it came forth, and he was as dead; so that many said, That he is dead.[27]And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he stood up.[28]And he having come into the house, his disciples asked him apart, Wherefore were we not able to cast him forth?[29]And he said to them, This kind can go, out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.[30]And having come out thence they passed through Galilee; and he desired not that any one should know.[31]For he taught his disciples, and said to them, That the Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, he shall raise himself the third day.[32]And they knew not the word, and were afraid to ask him.[33]And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What reasoned ye to yourselves in the way.[34]And they were silent; for they discussed to one another in the way, who the greatest.[35]And having sat down, he called the twelve, and says to them, If any wish to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.[36]And having taken a young child, he set him in the midst of them: and having taken it up in his arms, he said to them,[37]Whoever should receive ones of such young children in my name, receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives not me, but him sending me.[38]And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us: and we checked him, for he follows not us.[39]And Jesus said, Check him not: for there is no one who shall do power in my name, and shall be able quickly to revile me.[40]For whoever is not against us, is for us.[41]For whoever should give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are of Christ, verily I say to you, he should not lose his reward.[42]And whoever should scandalize one of these little ones believing in me, it is good for him rather if a millstone is put about his neck, and he be cast into the sea.[43]And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is good for thee rather to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go away into hell, into inextinguishable fire:[45]And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into inextinguishable fire:[47]And if thine eye offend thee, cast it out: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to come into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire:[48]Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.[49]For all shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.[50]Salt good: but if the salt be saltless, with what will ye prepare it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace one with another.","Mark.10":"[1]And having risen from thence, he comes into the bounds of Judea, through the other side of Jordan: and crowds came together again to him; and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.[2]And the Pharisees having come near, asked him, if it is lawful for a man to loose his wife; tempting him.[3]And he, having answered, said to them, What did Moses command you?[4]And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to loose.[5]And Jesus, having answered, said to them, For your hard heart he wrote you this command.[6]And from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.[7]For this will a man leave his father and mother, and be attached to his wife;[8]And they two shall be in one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.[9]What therefore God yoked together, let not man separate.[10]And again in the house, his disciples asked him of the same.[11]And he says to them, Whoever should loose his wife, and should marry another, commits adultery against her.[12]And if a woman should loose her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.[13]And they brought young children to him, that he might touch them: and the disciples rebuked those bringing.[14]And Jesus, having seen, felt pain, and said to them, Permit children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.[15]Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child, should not come into it.[16]And having taken them up in his arms, having put the hands upon them, he praised them.[17]And he going in the way, one running and having fallen upon his knees, asked him, Good teacher, What shall I do that I might inherit eternal life.[18]And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good, except the one God.[19]Thou knowest the commands: Thou shouldst not commit adultery; Thou shouldst not kill; Thou shouldst not steal; Thou shouldst not bear false testimony; Thou shouldst not defraud; Honour thy father and mother.[20]And he, having answered, said to him, O teacher, all these have I watched from my youth.[21]And Jesus having looked upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee retire; whatever thou hast, sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, having taken up the cross.[22]And he, being sad at the word, went away being grieved: for he had many possessions.[23]And Jesus having looked round, said to his disciples, With what difficulty shall they having property enter into the kingdom of God.[24]And his disciples were amazed at his words. And Jesus again having answered, says to them, How difficult, children, is it for those trusting in property to enter into the kingdom of God![25]It is easier labor for a camel to come through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.[26]And they were struck with amazement, excessively, saying to themselves, And who can be saved.[27]And Jesus having beheld them says, With men impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.[28]And Peter began to say to him, Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.[29]And Jesus having answered, said, Truly I say to you, There is none who has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for sake of me, and the good news,[30]Except he should receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mother, and children, and fields, with expulsions; and in the time coming eternal life.[31]And many first shall be last; and the last first.[32]And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was leading before them; and they were amazed; and following, they were afraid. And again taking the twelve, he began to say to them the things about to happen to him,[33]For, behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death: and shall deliver him to the nations:[34]And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall be raised up.[35]And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Teacher, we wish that whatever we should ask, thou wouldst do for us.[36]And he said to them, What wish you me to do for you?[37]And they said to him, Give us that we might sit, one from thy right hand, and one front thy left, in thy glory.[38]And Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink the cup which I drink? and the immersion with which I am immersed to be immersed.[39]And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Truly the cup which I drink shall ye drink; and the immersion with which I am immersed, shall ye be immersed.[40]And to sit from my right hand, and from my left is not mine to give; but for whom it has been prepared.[41]And the ten having heard, began to feel pain about James and John.[42]And Jesus having called them, says to them, Ye know that they thinking to be first of the nations rule over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.[43]And it shall not be so among you: but whoever should wish to be great among you, shall be your attendant:[44]And whoever of you should wish to be the first, he shall be the servant of all.[45]For also the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul a ransom for many.[46]And they come into Jericho: and he going out from Jericho, and his disciples, and a sufficient crowd, Bartimeus the blind, son of Timaeus, sat by the way asking alms.[47]And having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarite, he began to cry, and to say, Son of David, O Jesus, compassionate me.[48]And many were rebuking him, that he should be silent: and he cried much more, Son of David, compassionate me.[49]And Jesus having stood, spake for him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage, arise; he calls thee.[50]And he, having cast away his garment, having risen, came to Jesus.[51]And Jesus having answered, said to him, What wishest thou I should do to thee? And the blind said to him, Rabboni, that I might see again.[52]And Jesus said to him, Retire; thy faith has saved thee. And quickly he looked up, and followed Jesus in the way.","Mark.11":"[1]And when they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount of Olives, he sends two of his disciples,[2]And says to them, Retire into the town over against you: and quickly going into it, ye shall find a colt tied, upon which none of men has sat; having loosed, bring him.[3]And if any say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord has need of him; and quickly will he send him here.[4]And they went away, and found the colt tied to the door without by the road, and they loose him.[5]And certain standing there said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?[6]And they said as Jesus charged them: and they let them go.[7]And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they cast their garments upon him, and he sat upon him.[8]And many strewed their garments in the way: and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed in the way.[9]And they going before, and they following, cried, saying, Osanna; praised he coming in the name of the Lord:[10]Praised the kingdom coming in the name of the Lord of our father David: Osanna in the highest ones.[11]And Jesus came into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and having looked around upon all things, the hour being already coming, he went into Bethany with the twelve.[12]And in the morrow, they having come from Bethany, he hungered:[13]And having seen a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if yet he shall find any thing upon it; and having come to it, he found nothing except leaves; for it was not time of the figs.[14]And Jesus having answered, said to it, May none eat more fruit of thee forever. And his disciples heard.[15]And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus having entered into the temple, began to cast out those selling and buying in the temple; and the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those selling doves he overturned;[16]And he permitted not that any should bring a vessel through the temple.[17]And he taught, saying to them, Has it not been written, That my house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations? and ye made it a den of robbers.[18]And the scribes and chief priests heard, and they sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the crowd were struck with amazement at his teaching.[19]And when it was evening, he went without the city.[20]And in the morning, coming near, they saw the fig tree having been dried up from the roots.[21]And Peter, having recalled to mind, says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is dried up.[22]And Jesus having answered, says to them, Have the faith of God.[23]For truly I say to you, That whoever should say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and should not discuss in his heart, but believe that what he says, is; it shall be to him, whatever he should say.[24]For this I say to you, All things whatever, praying, ye ask, believe that ye receive, and it shall be to you.[25]And when ye stand praying, let go, if ye have any thing against any one: that also your Father, he in the heavens, might let go to you your falls.[27]And they come again to Jerusalem: and he walking in the temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders come to him,[28]And say to him, By what power doest thou these things? and who gave thee this power that thou doest these things?[29]And Jesus having answered, said to them, And I will ask you one word, and answer ye me, and I will tell you by what power I do these things.[30]Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.[31]And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Wherefore did ye not believe him.[32]But if we say, of men; they feared the people: for all held John, that he was truly a prophet.[33]And having answered they say to Jesus, We know not. And Jesus having answered, says to them, Neither say I to you by what power I do these things.","Mark.12":"[1]And be began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence round, and digged a winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.[2]And he sent a servant to the husbandmen in time, that he might receive of the husbandmen from the fruit of the vineyard.[3]And they, taking him, stripped, and sent away empty.[4]And again he sent to them another servant; and having stoned the same they treated in a summary manner, and sent away despised.[5]And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; truly stripping some, and killing some.[6]Yet therefore having one dearly beloved son, and him he sent last to them, saying, That they will be changed by my son.[7]And these husbandmen said with themselves, That this is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our’s.[8]And they having taken him, killed, and cast out of the vineyard.[9]Therefore what will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.[10]And have ye not read this writing; The stone which the builders disapproved of, this was for the head of the corner:[11]This was of the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes?[12]And they sought to seize him, and they feared the crowd: for they knew that he spake this parable against them: and having let him go they went away.[13]And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in the word.[14]And they having come, say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and thou carest not for any one: for thou lookest not to the face of men, but in truth thou teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or no?[15]Should we give, or not give? And he knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a drachma that I might see it.[16]And they brought. And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar’s.[17]And Jesus having answered, said to them, Give back Caesar’s things to Caesar, and the things of God to God. And they wondered at him.[18]And the Sadducees come to him, who say there is no rising up; and they asked him, saying,[19]Teacher, Moses wrote to us, That if any one’s brother die, and leave his wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.[20]There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.[21]And the second took her, and died, and neither left he seed: and the third likewise.[22]And the seven took her, and left no seed: and the woman died last of all.[23]Therefore in the rising up, when they should rise, to which of them shall the woman be? for the seven had her a wife.[24]And Jesus having answered, said to them, For this do ye not go astray, not knowing the writings, nor the power of God?[25]For when they arise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the messengers which in the heavens.[26]And concerning the dead that they are raised: have ye not read in the book of Moses, at the bramble, how God spake to him, I the God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.[27]He is not God of the dead, but God of the living; ye therefore go astray greatly.[28]And one of the scribes having come, having heard them seeking out together, knowing that he answered them well, asked him, Which is the first command of all?[29]And Jesus answered him, That the first of all the commands, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:[30]And thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole mind, and from thy whole strength: this the first command.[31]And the second like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. No other command is greater than these.[32]And the scribe said to him, Well, Teacher, in truth hast thou spoken: for one God is; and there is no other but he:[33]And to love him from the whole heart, and from the whole understanding, and from the whole soul, and from the whole strength, and to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the whole burnt offerrings, and the sacrifices.[34]And Jesus having seen him that he answered understandingly, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And none dared to ask him any more.[35]And Jesus having answered, said, teaching in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David.[36]For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand, till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.[37]Therefore David himself calls him Lord; and whence is he his son? And a great crowd heard him willingly.[38]And he said to them in his teaching, Look from the scribes, wishing to walk in robes, and greetings in market-places,[39]And first seats in synagogues, and first place at tables in first meals:[40]They eating in widows’ houses, and praying long for a pretext: these shall receive more abundant judgment.[41]And Jesus having sat over against the royal treasury, saw how the crowds cast money into the treasury: and many rich cast in much.[42]And one poor widow, having come, cast in two small coins, which is a farthing.[43]And having called his disciples, he says to them, Truly I say to you, That this poor widow has cast into the royal treasury, more than all they casting into the treasury:[44]For all they cast in out of the abundance to them; and she, out of her want, cast in all things which she had, her whole living.","Mark.13":"[1]And he going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see of what country the stones, and of what country the buildings![2]And Jesus having answered, said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? stone upon stone shall not be left which shall not be loosed.[3]And he sitting in the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart,[4]Say to us, when shall be these things? and what the sign when all these be about to be finished?[5]And Jesus having answered began to say to them, See ye lest any should lead you astray:[6]For many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and they shall lead many astray.[7]And when ye hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not terrified: for it must be; but the end is not yet.[8]For nation shall be raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in places, and there shall be famines, and commotions: these the beginnings of anguish.[9]And see ye to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues shall ye be stripped: and shall be set before rulers and kings for my sake, for testimony to them.[10]And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.[11]And when delivering up, they bring you, take no care beforehand what ye speak, neither bestow attention: but whatever should be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for not ye are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.[12]And brother shall deliver brother to death, and father child; and children shall rise up against parents, and kill them.[13]And ye shall be hated by all for my name’s sake: and he having remained to the end, the same shall be saved.[14]And when ye see the abomination of desolation, that spoken by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him reading understand,) then let them in Judea flee to the mountains:[15]And he upon the house, let him not come down into the house, nor let him come in, to take any thing away out of his house:[16]And he being in the field, let him not turn back to take up his garment.[17]And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck in those days![18]And pray ye that your flight be not of winter.[19]For those days shall be pressure, such as there has not been from beginning of creation which God created till now, and should not be.[20]And except the Lord shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but for the chosen whom he chose, he shortened the days.[21]And if any say to you, Behold, here Christ; or, behold, there; believe ye not:[22]For false Christ’s and false prophets shall be raised up, and shall give signs and wonders, to deceive, if possible, also the chosen.[23]But see ye; behold, I have foretold you all things.[24]But in those days, after that pressure, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,[25]And the stars of heaven shall be falling out, and the powers which in the heavens shall be shaken.[26]And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with much power and glory.[27]And then shall he send his messengers, and gather together his chosen from the four winds, from extremity of earth to extremity of heaven.[28]And from the fig tree learn ye a parable; When its young shoot be tender, and cause the leaves to grow, ye know that summer is near.[29]So also ye, when ye see these things done, ye know that it is near at the door.[30]Truly I say to you, that this generation should not pass away, till all these things should be.[31]Heaven and earth shall pass away, and my words shall not pass away.[32]And concerning that day and hour none knows, nor the messengers in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.[33]See, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.[34]As a man traveling, having left his house, and having given power to his servants, and to each his work, and he commanded the guard of the door that he should watch.[35]Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house comes, at eve, or midnight, or cock-crowing, or morning.[36]Lest having come suddenly he find you sleeping.[37]And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch ye.","Mark.14":"[1]And after two days was the pascha, and the unleavened loaves: and the chief priests and scribes sought how, having taken him by fraud, they might kill.[2]And they said, Not in the festival, lest there be an uproar of the people.[3]And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leprous, he reclining at table, a woman came having an alabaster box of perfumed oil of persuasive, costly, spikenard; and having broken the alabaster box, she poured upon his head.[4]And there were some displeased in themselves, and saying, For what has been the loss of this perfumed oil?[5]For this could have been sold for above three hundred drachmas, and have been given to the poor. And they raged against her.[6]And Jesus said, Let her go; why bestow ye weariness upon her? she has wrought a good work upon me.[7]For always have ye the poor with you, and when ye wish ye can do them good: and me ye have not always.[8]And what she had, she has done: she has undertaken beforehand to perfume my body for the burial.[9]Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news be proclaimed in the whole world, also what she has done shall be spoken for a memorial of her.[10]And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.[11]And having heard, they rejoiced, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might opportunely deliver him up.[12]And in the first day of the unleavened, when they sacrificed the pascha, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou, we, having gone, should prepare that thou eat the pascha.[13]And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Retire to the city, and a man shall meet you bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow him.[14]And wherever he should enter in, say to the lord of the house, That the Teacher says, Where is the room where I might eat the pascha with my disciples?[15]And he will shew you a great apartment spread, ready: there prepare for us.[16]And his disciples went out, and came to the city, and found as he said to them: and they prepared the pascha.[17]And having been evening, he comes with the twelve.[18]And they reclining and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, That one of you shall deliver me up, he eating with me.[19]And they began to be grieved, and to say to him one by one, What, not I? and another, What, not I?[20]And he having answered, said to them, One of the twelve, he dipping with me into the small dish.[21]Truly the Son of man retires, as has been written of him: and woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! it were good for him if that man had not been born.[22]And they eating, Jesus having taken bread, having praised, brake, and gave them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.[23]And having taken the cup, having returned thanks, he gave them: and they all drank of it.[24]And he said to them, This is my blood, that of the new covenant, being poured out for many.[25]Truly I say to you, that I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.[26]And having sung, they came out to the mount of Olives.[27]And Jesus says to them, That all ye shall be offended with me in this night: for it has been written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.[28]But after I have risen, I will lead before you into Galilee.[29]And Peter said to him, And if all shall be offended, yet not I.[30]And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee, That to day, in this night, surely before the cock has uttered a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.[31]And he said more excessively, If I should die with thee, I shall not deny thee. And so likewise they all said.[32]And they came to a place, the name of which Gethsemane: and he says to his disciples, Sit here, while I shall pray.[33]And he takes Peter and James and John with himself, and began to be amazed, and to be dejected.[34]And he says to them, My soul is sorely grieved, even to death: remain here, and watch.[35]And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth and prayed that, if it be possible, the hour might pass away from him.[36]And he said, Abba, Father, all things possible to thee; turn away this cup from me: but not what I will, but what thou.[37]And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? could eat thou not watch one Hour?[38]Watch ye and pray, that ye should not come into temptation. Truly the spirit well inclined, and the flesh weak.[39]And again having gone away, he prayed; saying the same word.[40]And having turned back, he found them again sleeping, (for their eyes were loaded,) and they knew not what they might answer him.[41]And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep the remaining time, and take rest: it is sufficient, the hour has come; behold, the Son of man is delivered into the hands of the sinful.[42]Arise, and let us lead; behold, he delivering me up has drawn near.[43]And quickly, he yet speaking, Judas approaches, being one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and scribes and the more ancient.[44]And he delivering him up gave them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, this is he; seize him, and lead away safely.[45]And having come, quickly having approached him, he says, Rabbi, rabbi; and kissed him.[46]And they put their hands on him, and seized him.[47]And a certain one of them standing by, having drawn a sword, struck the chief priest’s servant, and took away his ear.[48]And Jesus having answered, said to them, As against a robber come ye out, with swords and sticks to take me.[49]Daily was I with you in the temple teaching, and ye seized me not: but that the writings might be completed.[50]And having left him, they all fled.[51]And one certain young man followed him, having cast a garment of fine linen over his nakedness; and the young men seized him:[52]And having left the fine linen garment, he fled from them naked.[53]And they led Jesus away to the pontificate: and all the chief priests and elders and scribes came with him.[54]And Peter followed him from far, even to within the court-yard of the chief priest: and he was sitting with the attendants, and warming himself near the light.[55]And the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus, to put him to death; and found not:[56]For many testified falsely against him, and the testimonies were not alike.[57]And certain having risen up testified falsely against him, saying,[58]That we heard him saying, That I will abolish this temple made with hands, and in three days will I build another, made without hands.[59]And neither so was their testimony alike.[60]And the chief priest having risen up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what these testify against thee.[61]And he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the chief priest asks him, and says to him, Art thou Christ, Son of the Praised.[62]And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting from the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.[63]And the chief priest, having rent his tunic, says, What further need have we of witnesses.[64]Ye have heard the blasphemy; How does it appear to you? And they all condemned him to be liable to the penalty of death.[65]And certain began to spit upon him, and to cover his face, and to cuff him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the attendants struck him blows with rods.[66]And Peter being in the hall how, one of the chief priest’s young girls comes:[67]And seeing Peter warming himself, having looked upon him, she says, And thou wast with Jesus the Nazarene.[68]And he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand what thou sayest. And he went forth without into the vestibule; and the cock uttered a sound.[69]And the young girl seeing him again, began to say to, them standing by, That this is of them: and again he denied.[70]And after a little, again they standing by said to Peter, Truly thou art of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is like.[71]And he began to anathematize and swear, That I know not this man of whom ye speak.[72]And of the second time the cock uttered a sound. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus spake to him, That before the cock utter a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And throwing blame, he wept.","Mark.15":"[1]And quickly the chief priests having made counsel with the more ancient and scribes and the whole council, having bound Jesus, led away, and delivered to Pilate.[2]And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And having answered, he said to him, Thou sayest.[3]And the chief priests accused him much.[4]And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how much they accuse thee.[5]And Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.[6]And at the festival he loosed to them one in bonds, whomsoever they asked.[7]And there was he called Barabbas, bound with those exciting sedition, who did murder in the revolt.[8]And the crowd having cried, began to ask as he did always to them.[9]And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye I loose to you the King of the Jews?[10]For he knew that through envy the chief priests had delivered him up:[11]And the chief priests moved the crowd, that he would rather loose Barabbas to them.[12]And Pilate having answered, again said to them, What then will ye I should do to him whom ye call King of the Jews?[13]And again they cried out, Crucify him.[14]And Pilate said to them, But what evil has he done? And they cried out more excessively, Crucify him.[15]And Pilate, willing to satisfy the crowd, loosed to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, having scourged, that he might be crucified.[16]And the soldiers led him away within the hall, which is the Pretorium; and they call together the whole band.[17]And they clothed him with purple, and put round him, having woven, a thorny crown.[18]And they began to greet him, Hail, O King of the Jews.[19]And they struck his head with a reed, and they spit upon him, and having placed the knees, they worshipped him.[20]And when they mocked him, they put off the purple from him, and clothed him with his own garments, and led him out that they might crucify him.[21]And they constrain a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, passing by, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might take up his cross.[22]And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, interpreted, The place of a skull.[23]And they gave him wine to drink, prepared with myrrh: and he took not.[24]And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon what any should take up.[25]And it was the third hour, and they crucified him:[26]And the inscription of his accusation was inscribed above, THE KING OF THE JEWS.[27]And with him they crucify two robbers; one from the right, and one from the left.[29]And they going by blasphemed him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ah, thou loosing the temple, and building in three days,[30]Save thyself, and come down from the cross.[31]And likewise also the chief priests, mocking to one another with the scribes, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.[32]Let Christ, King of Israel, come down from the cross, that we might see and believe. And they crucified with him reproached him.[33]And being the sixth hour, darkness was upon the whole earth till the ninth hour.[34]And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, for what hast thou forsaken me?[35]And some of them standing by, having heard, said, Behold, he calls Elias.[36]And one running and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and put round a reed, gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see if Elias will come to take him down.[37]And Jesus having let go a great voice, expired.[38]And the veil of the temple was split in two from above to below.[39]And the centurion, standing over against him, having seen that having so cried out he expired, said, Truly this man was the Son- of God.[40]And women also were beholding from far: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James the small and the mother of Joses, and Salome;[41](And they, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him;) and many other women, having come up with him to Jerusalem.[42]And being already evening, for it was the preparation, which is before sabbath,[43]Joseph came from Arimathea, a distinguished counsellor, who also himself was expecting the kingdom of God, having ventured, he went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.[44]And Pilate wondered if he were already dead: and having called the centurion, he asked him if he had been dead long ago.[45]And having known from the centurion, he bestowed the body to Joseph.[46]And having bought fine linen, and taken him down, he rolled in fine linen, and placed him in a tomb, which was quarried out of a rock, and he rolled a stone at the door of the tomb.[47]And Mary Magdalene and Mari of Joses were beholding where he is laid.","Mark.16":"[1]And the sabbath having intervened, Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they might anoint him.[2]And very early in the morning of one of the sabbaths, they came to the tomb, the sun having risen.[3]And they said to themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?[4]And having looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.[5]And having come to the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, being encompassed with a white robe; and they were terrified.[6]And he says to them, Be not terrified: Ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, being crucified: he was raised; he is not here: see the place where they laid him.[7]But retire ye; say to his disciples and to Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.[8]And having come forth quickly, they fled from the tomb; and terror and amazement held them: and they said nothing to any; for they were afraid.[9]And having risen early the first of the sabbath, he was manifested first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast seven demons.[10]She having gone announced to them having been with him, grieving and weeping.[11]And they having heard that he lives, and was seen by her, believed not.[12]And after these things, to two of them, walking about, was he manifested in another form, they going into the field.[13]And they having come announced to the rest: neither did they believe them.[14]Afterwards to those reclining at table was he manifested, and he reproached their unbelief and hard heart, because they believed not them having seen him raised.[15]And he said to them, Having gone into all the world proclaim the good news to all creation.[16]And he having believed and having been immersed shall be saved; but he not having believed shall be condemned.[17]And these signs shall follow those having believed; In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;[18]They shall take up serpents; and should they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall put hands upon the sick, and they shall be well.[19]Truly therefore the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into the heavens, and sat on the right hand of God.[20]And they, having gone forth, proclaimed every where, the Lord performing together, and confirming the word by signs following. Amen.","Luke.1":"[1]Since many have undertaken to arrange the narration concerning things rendered perfectly certain among us,[2]As they delivered to us, who from the beginning being eyewitnesses, and servants of the word;[3]It seemed fitting to me also, having comprehended all things thoroughly from above, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,[4]That thou mightest know the certainty of the words concerning which thou hast been instructed.[5]There was in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the daily order of Abia: and his wife the daughter of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.[6]And they were both just before God, going faultless in all the commands and precepts of the Lord.[7]And no child was to them, as Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.[8]And it was in his being priest, in the arranging of the daily order before God,[9]According to the custom of the priesthood, he drew lots to burn incense, having entered into the temple of the Lord.[10]And all the multitude of people were praying without at the hour of incense.[11]And a messenger of the Lord was seen to him, standing from the right of the altar of fumigation.[12]And Zacharias having seen, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.[13]And the messenger said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy supplication has been heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.[14]And joy shall be to thee, and gladness: and many shall rejoice at his birth.[15]For he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and fermented liquor he should not drink; and with the Holy Spirit shall he be filled, even from his mother’s womb.[16]And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn back to the Lord their God.[17]And he shall come before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the intelligence of the just; to prepare a people having been put in order for the Lord.[18]And Zacharias said to the messenger, By what shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife advanced in her days.[19]The messenger having answered, said to him, I am Gabriel, standing before God; and was sent to speak to thee, and announce these good news to thee.[20]And, behold, thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall be, because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be completed in their time.[21]And the people were expecting Zacharias, and wondered at his tarrying in the temple.[22]And having come out, he could not speak to them: and they knew that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he was nodding to them, and remained dumb.[23]And it was when the days of his service were filled, he departed to his house.[24]And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and concealed herself five months, saying,[25]That so has the Lord done to me in days which he looked upon, to take away my reproach among men.[26]And in the sixth month the messenger Gabriel was sent by God into a city of Galilee, to which the name Nazareth,[27]To a virgin betrothed to a man to whom the name of Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name Mary.[28]And the messenger, having come in to her said, Hail, thou made acceptable; the Lord with thee: praised thou among women.[29]And having seen him, she was troubled at his words, and turned in her thoughts of what country this greeting might be.[30]And the messenger said to her, Fear not, Mary: thou hast found grace with God.[31]And, behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and shalt bear a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS.[32]He shall be great, and he shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father:[33]And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.[34]And Mary said to the messenger, How shall this be, since I know not man?[35]And the messenger having answered, said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing born of thee shall be called the Son of God.[36]And, behold, Elizabeth thy kinsman, she also having conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month to her, called barren.[37]For nothing shall be impossible with God.[38]And Mary said Behold the servant of the Lord; may it be to me according to thy word. And the messenger departed from her.[39]And Mary having risen in those days, went into the mountainous country with haste, into a city of Judah;[40]And she entered into the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elizabeth.[41]And it was when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:[42]And she called out with a great voice, and said, Praised thou among women, and praised the fruit of thy womb.[43]And whence this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?[44]For, behold, when the voice of thy greeting was in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.[45]And happy she having believed: for a completion of the things spoken shall be to her from the Lord.[46]And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord.[47]And my Spirit rejoiced in God my Saviour.[48]For he looked upon the humiliation of his servant; for, behold, from now shall all generations deem me happy.[49]For the powerful one has done great things for me; and his name holy.[50]And his mercy to generations of generations to those fearing him.[51]He has done strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thought of their heart.[52]He has pulled down the powerful from thrones, and lifted up the.[53]He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he sent away empty.[54]He succored Israel his servant, remembering mercy;[55]As he spake to our fathers, to Abram, and his seed forever.[56]And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.[57]And the time was completed to Elizabeth, for her to bring forth; and she brought forth a son.[58]And they dwelling near and her kinsmen heard, for the Lord magnified his mercy with her; and they rejoiced with her.[59]And it was in the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias.[60]And his mother, having answered said, Nay; but he shall be called John.[61]And they said to her, That there is none among thy kindred who is called by this name.[62]And they nodded to his father, what he may wish to have him called.[63]And having asked for a small writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.[64]And his month was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, praising God.[65]And fear was upon all dwelling round about them: and in all the mount of Judea all these words were discoursed about.[66]And all having heard, set in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.[67]And Zacharias his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,[68]Praised the Lord God of Israel; for he reviewed and he has made a redemption for his people,[69]And he raised up a horn of salvation to us in the house of David, his servant;[70]As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, from forever:[71]Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all hating us;[72]To do mercy with our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant:[73]The oath which he sware to Abraham our father,[74]To give to us, fearlessly, delivered from the hands of our enemies,[75]To serve him in sanctity and justice before him all the days of our life.[76]And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;[77]To give knowledge of salvation to his people, in remission of their sins.[78]Through the bowels of mercy of our God; by which the rising of the sun of sublimity has reviewed us,[79]To shine forth to those in darkness and sitting in the shadow of death, to direct our feet in the way of peace.[80]And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing forth to Israel.","Luke.2":"[1]And it was in those days an order came out from Caesar Angustus, for the whole habitable globe to be enrolled.[2](This enrolling was first, Cyrenius being leader of Syria.)[3]And all went to be enrolled, each in his own city.[4]And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (for he was of the house and family of David:)[5]To be enrolled with Mary his betrothed wife, being pregnant.[6]And it was in their being there, the days were completed for her to bring forth.[7]And she brought forth her firstborn son, and swathed him, and put him in a manger; for there was no place for them in the inn.[8]And shepherds were in the country, sleeping in the fields, and watching over their flock the watches of the night.[9]And, behold, a messenger of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them: and they fear a great fear.[10]And the messenger said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I announce you good news, great joy, which shall be to all people.[11]For this day a Saviour was born to you, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.[12]And this the sign to you; ye shall find the babe swathed, lying in a manger.[13]And suddenly was there a multitude with the messenger of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,[14]Glory to God in the highest ones, and upon earth peace, benevolence in men.[15]And it was when the messenger departed from them into heaven, and the men, the shepherds, said to one another, Let us pass through now to Bethlehem, and see this word done, which the Lord made known to us.[16]And having hastened, they came and found both Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.[17]And having seen, they made known concerning the word spoken to them about the child.[18]And all having heard wondered at the things spoken to them by the shepherds.[19]And Mary kept together all these sayings, reflecting in her heart.[20]And the shepherds returned, honouring and praising God for all which they heard and saw, as was spoken to them.[21]And when eight days were completed for circumcising the child and his name was called JESUS, called by the messenger before he was conceived in the womb.[22]And when the days of her cleansing were completed, according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to present to the Lord;[23](As has been written in the law of the Lord, That every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)[24]And to give a sacrifice according to that said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two of the young of pigeons.[25]And, behold, a man was in Jerusalem, the name to him Simeon; and this man just and cautious, waiting the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.[26]And it was intimated to him by the Holy Spirit, not to see death, before he should see the Christ of the Lord.[27]And he came in the Spirit to the temple: and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus, for them to do according to the custom of the law for him,[28]And he took him into his arms, and praised God, and said:[29]Now Lord, thou wilt loose thy servant, according to thy word, in peace:[30]For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,[31]Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples:[32]A light for the revelation of the nations, and the glory of thy people Israel.[33]And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken of him.[34]And Simeon praised them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, he is laid for the fall and rising up of many in Israel; and for a sign spoken against;[35](And also a spear shall pass through the soul of thyself,) so that the reasonings from many hearts might be revealed.[36]And Anna was a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she advanced in many days, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;[37]And she a widow of about eighty-four years, who departed not from the temple, with fastings and supplications serving night and day.[38]And she having stood at that hour, confessed to the Lord, and spake concerning him to all awaiting redemption in Jerusalem.[39]And when they finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their city, Nazareth.[40]And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, being filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.[41]And his parents went every year to Jerusalem to the festival of the passover.[42]And when he was of twelve years, they having gone up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the festival:[43]And having completed the days, in their returning the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not.[44]And they, having supposed him to be in the caravan, came the way of a day, and sought him among kinsmen and among acquaintances.[45]And not having found him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.[46]And it was after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of teachers, and hearing them, and inquiring of them.[47]And all hearing him were affected in mind at his understanding and answers.[48]And having seen him, they were struck with awe: and his mother said to him, Child, why didst thou so to us? behold, thy father and I, grieving, have sought thee.[49]And he said to them, For what have ye sought me? knew ye not that among the things of my Father I must be?[50]And they understood not the word which he spake to them.[51]And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was placed under them: and his mother kept all these words in her heart.[52]And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age, and in grace with God and man.","Luke.3":"[1]Know in the fifteenth year of the supremacy of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being leader of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother being tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,[2]Upon Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests, the word of God was upon John, son of Zacharias in the desert.[3]And he came into all the country round about Jordan, proclaiming the immersion of repentance for remission of sins;[4]As it has been written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his footpaths straight.[5]Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mount and hill shall be lowered; and the crooked shall be into straightness, and the rough into smooth ways.[6]And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.[7]Then said he to the crowds coming out to be immersed by him, Generation of vipers, who indicated to you to flee from the anger about to come?[8]Do ye therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say in yourselves, We have a father Abraham: for I say to you, That God is able to raise children to Abraham of these stones.[9]And also the axe is already laid at the root of the trees: therefore every tree not making good fruit is cut down, and cast into fire.[10]And the crowds asked him, saying, What therefore shall we do?[11]And he having answered, says to them, He having two coats, let him impart to him having none; and he having food, let him do likewise.[12]And publicans came to be immersed, and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?[13]And he said to them, Do nothing more than that appointed you.[14]And they making war asked him, saying, And what shall do? And he said to them, Shake none violently, neither make slanderous accusation; and be content with your pay.[15]And the people awaiting, and all reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he may not be the Christ;[16]John answered to all, saying, I truly immerse you with water; and he stronger than I comes, of whom I am not worthy to loose his shoes’ strings: he shall immerse you with the Holy Spirit and fire:[17]Whose winnowing fan in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and gather the wheat into his store; and the chaff he will burn down with inextinguishable fire.[18]And then truly many other things beseeching, he evangelized the people.[19]And Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod did,[20]And he added this to all, and shut up John in prison.[21]And it was in all the people having been immersed, and Jesus having been immersed, and praying, heaven was opened,[22]And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him, and there was a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my dearly loved Son; in thee I was contented.[23]And Jesus himself was beginning about thirty years, being, as was thought, the son of Joseph, of Eli,[24]Of Matthat, of Levi, of Melchi, of Janna, of Joseph,[25]Of Mattathias, of Amos, of Naum, of Esli, of Naggai,[26]Of Maath, of Mattathias, of Semei, of Joseph, of Juda,[27]Of Joanna, of Rhesa, of Zorobabel, of Salathiel, of Neri,[28]Of Melchi, of Addi, of Cosam, of Elmodam, of Er,[29]Of Jose, of Eliezer, of Jorim, of Matthat, of Levi,[30]Of Simeon, of Juda, of Joseph, of Jonan, of Eliakim,[31]Of Melea, of Menan, of Mattatha, of Nathan, of David,[32]Of Jesse, of Obed, of Booz, of Salmon, of Naasson,[33]Of Aminadab, of Aram, of Esrom, of Phares, of Juda,[34]Of Jacob, of Isaac, of Abraham, of Thara, of Nachor,[35]Of Saruch, of Ragau, of Phalec, of Eber, of Sala,[36]Of Cainan, of Arphaxad, of Sem, of Noe, of Lamech,[37]Of Mathusala, of Enoch, of Jared, of Maleleel, of Cainan,[38]Of Enos, of Seth, of Adam, of God.","Luke.4":"[1]And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned back from Jordan, and was led by the Holy Spirit into the desert,[2]Being tempted forty days by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days: and they having ended, he afterward hungered.[3]And the devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, say thou to this stone that it might be bread.[4]And Jesus answered to him saying, It has been written, That not by bread alone shall man live, but by every word of God.[5]And the devil, bringing him into a high mountain, shewed him all the kingdoms of the habitable globe in an instant of time.[6]And the devil said to him, I will give thee all this power, and their glory; for to me has it been delivered; and to whom I will I give it.[7]Therefore if thou worship before me, all shall be thine.[8]And having answered him Jesus said, Retire behind me, Satan: for it has been written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.[9]And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him upon the small wing of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God; cast thyself down from hence:[10]For it has been written, That he shall charge his messengers concerning thee, to watch over thee:[11]And upon hands shall they lift thee up, lest that perhaps thou shouldest strike thy foot against a stone.[12]And Jesus having answered said to him, That it has been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.[13]And having ended all the trial, the devil departed from him for a time.[14]And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a rumor went out concerning him through the whole country round about.[15]And he taught in their assemblies, being honoured of all.[16]And he came to Nazareth where he was brought up, and he went in, as was the custom to him in the day of the sabbaths, into the assembly, and stood up to read.[17]And the book of Esaias the prophet was given to him. And having unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written,[18]The Spirit of the Lord is upon me for which he anointed me to announce good news to the poor; he has sent me to heal the broken in heart, to proclaim a remission to the captives, and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send away with remission the bruised,[19]To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.[20]And having folded the book and given back to the servant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the assembly were looking attentively upon him.[21]And he began to say to them, That this day has this writing been filled up in your ears.[22]And all bore him testimony and wondered at the words of grace going out of his mouth: and said, Is not this the son of Joseph[23]And he said to them, Directly will ye say to me this proverb, Physician, cure thyself: what things we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.[24]And he said; Truly I say to you, That not any prophet is accepted in his country.[25]And I tell you of a truth, many widows were in the days of Elias in Israel, When heaven was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine Was upon all the land;[26]And to none of them was Elias sent, except to Sarepta, of Sidon, to a widow woman.[27]And many leprous were during Eliseus the prophet in Israel; and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.[28]And all in the assembly were filled with wrath, hearing these things,[29]And having risen up, they cast him without the city, and they brought him to the brow of the mount upon which their city was built, to hurt him down.[30]And he having passed through the midst of them, went away.[31]And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the sabbaths.[32]And they were struck with amazement at his teaching: for his word was with power.[33]And in the assembly was a man having the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,[34]Saying, Let alone; what to us and thee, Jesus Nazarene? hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy of God.[35]And Jesus answered him, saying, Be then silent, and come Out of him. And the demon having thrown him into the midst, came out of him, not having injured him.[36]And amazement was upon all, and they spake to one another, saying, What this word with authority and power he commands unclean spirits, and they come out.[37]And a report went forth concerning him into every place of the country round about.[38]And having risen from the assembly, he went into Simon’s house. And Simon’s mother-in-law was taken with a great fever; and they entreated him for her.[39]And having stood over her, he censured the fever: and it left her: and having risen immediately she served them.[40]And the sun setting, all as many as had sick ones with various diseases brought them to him; and he having put hands upon each one of them, cured them.[41]And demons came out of many, crying, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And answering he suffered them not to speak, for they knew him to be Christ.[42]And it having been day, having gone forth he went into a deserted place: and the crowds sought him, and came to him, and detained him not to go from them.[43]And he said to them, That also to other cities must I announce the good news, the kingdom of God: because for this have I been sent.[44]And he was proclaiming in the assemblies of Galilee.","Luke.5":"[1]And it was the crowd pressing close upon him to hear the word of God, and he was standing near the lake of Gennesaret,[2]And he saw two ships standing near the lake: and the fishermen having gone out of them, washed the fishing-nets.[3]And having gone into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, he asked him to sail out a little from land. And having sat down, he taught the crowds out of the ship.[4]And when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Sail out into the deep, and slacken your nets for fishing.[5]And Simon having answered, said to him, Commander, wearied for the whole night, we took nothing: but at thy word I will slacken the net.[6]And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net broke through;[7]And they nodded to partners, those in the other ship, that having come they should succor them. And they came and filled both ships, so that they were sinking.[8]And Simon Peter fell upon his knees before Jesus, saying, Go out from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.[9]For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;[10]And likewise also James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now thou shalt be capturing men.[11]And having brought down the ship upon the land, having let go all things, they followed him.[12]And it was in his being in one of the cities, and behold a man full of leprosy: and having seen Jesus, having fallen upon the face, supplicated him, saying, Lord, if thou wouldst, thou canst cleanse me.[13]And having put forth the hand, he touched him, saying, I will: be thou cleansed. And the leprosy departed from him.[14]And he enjoined him to tell none: but having departed, show thyself to the priest, and bring near for thy cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.[15]But the more the word passed through concerning him: and many crowds came together to hear, anti to be cured from their weaknesses.[16]And he was retreating into the deserts, and praying.[17]And it was in one of the days, and he was teaching, and the Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was for healing them.[18]And, behold, men bringing upon a bed a man who was affected with paralysis; and they sought to bring him, and set before him.[19]And not finding how they might bring him in, for the crowd, having ascended upon the house, they put him down through the tiles, with the small couch, in the midst before Jesus.[20]And having seen their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are remitted to thee.[21]And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason with themselves, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can remit sins but God alone?[22]And Jesus having known their reflections, having answered, said to them, What do ye reason with yourselves in your hearts?[23]Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are remitted to thee; or to say, Arise and walk?[24]And that ye might know that the Son of man has power upon earth to remit sins, (he said to him affected with paralysis,) I say to thee, Arise, and having taken up thy conch, go into thy house.[25]And immediately having risen before them, having taken up on what he lay, he went away to his house, honouring God.[26]And amazement took them all, and they honoured God, and were filled with fear, saying, That we have seen wonderful things to day.[27]And after these, he went out, and saw a publican, by name Levi, sitting by the custom-house; and he said to him, Follow me.[28]And having left all, having risen, he followed him.[29]And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house: and there was a great crowd of publicans and others who were sitting down with them.[30]And the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Wherefore eat and drink ye with publicans and sinful?[31]And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Those being in good health have no need of a physician; but they being ill.[32]I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.[33]And they said to him, Wherefore do the disciples of John fast frequently, and make prayers, and likewise they of the Pharisees; and they to thee eat and drink.[34]And he said to them, Ye cannot make the sons of the nuptial chamber fast, when the bridegroom is with them.[35]But the days will come also, when the bridegroom shall be carried away from them; then shall they fast in those days.[36]And he also spake to them a parable; That none put a piece of new garment, upon an old garment; and if not so, the new also splits, and the piece from the new agrees not with the old.[37]And none put new wine into old wine-skins; and if not so, the new wine bursts the wine-skins, and it will be poured out, and the wine-skins will perish.[38]But new wine cast into new wine-skins; and both are kept.[39]And none drinking old, quickly desires new, for he says, The old is better.","Luke.6":"[1]And it was in the second first sabbath, he went through the standing corn; and his disciples pulled out the ears of corn, and ate, crumbling in small pieces with hands.[2]And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is not lawful to do in the sabbaths.[3]And having answered to them, Jesus said, Have ye not read this, which David did when he hungered, and they being with him;[4]How he went into the house of God, and took the loaves of the setting before, and ate, and gave also to those with him; which is not lawful to eat, except for priests alone?[5]And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.[6]And it was also in another sabbath, he came into the assembly, and taught: and a man was there, and his right hand was withered.[7]And the scribes and Pharisees observed him narrowly, if he will heal in the sabbath: that they might find accusation against him.[8]And he knew their reflections, and said to the man having the withered hand, Arise, and stand in the midst. And having risen, he stood.[9]Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you; What is lawful in the sabbath; to do good, or to do evil? to save the life, or destroy.[10]And having looked round upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.[11]And they were filled with want of understanding; and they discoursed with one another What they may do to Jesus.[12]And it was in those days, he went out to the mount to pray, and he was passing the whole night in prayer to God.[13]And when it was day, he called to his disciples: and having chosen twelve from them, and he named them, the sent;[14]Simon, (and he named him Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,[15]Matthew and Thomas, James, him of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes,[16]Judas, of James, and Judas Iscariot, and he was the traitor.[17]And having come down with them, he stood upon a level place, and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the maritime country of Tyre and Sidon, they also came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;[18]And those molested with unclean spirits: and they were cured.[19]And all the crowd sought to touch him; for there came forth power from him, and healed all.[20]And he having lifted up his eyes upon his disciples, said, Happy the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.[21]Happy the hungering now: for ye shall be satisfied. Happy the weeping now: for ye shall laugh.[22]Happy are ye, when men hate you, and when they separate you, and reproach, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.[23]Rejoice in that day, and skip: for, behold, your reward much in heaven: for according to these did their fathers to the prophets.[24]But woe to you rich for ye take away your consolation.[25]Woe to you having been filled for ye shall hunger. Woe to you laughing now! for ye shall grieve and weep.[26]Woe to you when all men speak well of you! for according to these did their fathers to the false prophets.[27]But I say to you hearing, Love your enemies; do good to those hating you,[28]Praise those cursing you, and pray for those threatening you.[29]To him striking thee upon the cheek hold also near the other; and from him taking away thy garments, and thou shouldest not retrench thy coat.[30]And to every one asking thee, do thou give; and from him taking away thy things, re-demand not.[31]And as ye wish that men would do to you, and do you to them likewise.[32]And if ye love them loving you, what grace is to you? for also the sinful would love those loving them.[33]And if ye do good to those doing good to you, what grace is to you? for also the sinful do the same.[34]And if ye lend of whom ye hope to receive back, what grace is to you? for also the sinful lend to the sinful, that they might receive back the like things.[35]But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing back; and your reward shall be much, and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the graceless and evil.[36]Be ye therefore compassionate, as also your Father is compassionate.[37]And judge not, and ye should not be judged: condemn not, and ye should not be condemned: loose ye, and ye shall be loosed.[38]Give, and it shall be given you; good measure, yielded, and shaken, and overflowed, shall they give into your bosom: for with the same measure that ye measure, shall it be measured back to you.[39]And he spake to them a parable, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?[40]For the learner is not above his teacher: and every one set in order shall be as his teacher.[41]And why beholdest thou the dried straw in thy brother’s eye, and perceivest not the beam in thine own eye?[42]Or how Canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, suffer that I cast out the mote in thine eye, thyself not beholding the beam in thine eye? O hypocrite, cast out first the beam from thine own eye, and then shalt thou see through to cast out the mote in thy brother’s eye.[43]For it is not a good tree making decayed fruit; neither a decayed tree making good fruit.[44]For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns they gather not figs, nor of the bramble do they harvest the grape.[45]The good man out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forward the good thing; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forward the evil thing: for out of the abundance of the heart does his month speak.[46]And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not what I say?[47]Every one coming to me, and hearing my words, and doing them, I will shew you to whom he is like:[48]He is like to a man building a house, who digged, and deepened, and set the foundation upon the rock: and there having been an overflow, the river dashed against that house, and was not able to move it: for it was founded upon the rock.[49]And he having heard, and not having done, is like a man having built a house upon the earth, without a foundation; against which the river dashed, and immediately it fell; and the breaking of that house was great.","Luke.7":"[1]And when he completed all his words in the ears of the people, he came to Capernaum.[2]And a certain centurion’s servant being sick, was about to die; which was highly valued by him.[3]And having heard of Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him, that having come, he would save his servant.[4]And they approaching to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, That he is worthy to whom he will bestow this:[5]For he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.[6]And Jesus went with them. And now he being away not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not fit that thou shouldest come under my roof;[7]Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.[8]For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I say to this, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes: and to my servant, Do this, and he does.[9]And Jesus having heard these, wondered at him, and having turned to the crowd following him, he said, I say to you, Neither have I found so much faith in Israel.[10]And those sent, having turned back to the house, found the servant being sick, restored to health.[11]And it was in continuation he went to a city called Nain; and sufficient of his disciples went with him, and a great crowd.[12]And as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, he dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a widow; and a sufficient crowd of the city was with her.[13]And having seen her, the Lord felt compassion for her and said to her, Weep not.[14]And having come, he touched the coffin, and they bearing stood. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, arise.[15]And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.[16]And fear took all; and they praised God, saying, That a great prophet has risen up among us; and That God has reviewed his people.[17]And this word went out about him in all Judea, and in all the country round about.[18]And John’s disciples announced to him of all these things.[19]And having called certain two of his disciples, John sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?[20]And the men, having approached to him, said, John the Immerser has sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?[21]And in that same hour he cured many of diseases, and scourges, and evil spirits, and to many blind he conferred the favor to see.[22]And Jesus having answered said to them, Having gone, announce to John what ye saw and heard; for the blind look up, the lame walk, the leprous are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are announced good news.[23]And happy is he, whoever should not be offended in me.[24]And the messengers of John having departed, he began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye forth into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?[25]But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those in glorious clothing, and being in luxury, are in royal abodes.[26]But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, superior to a prophet.[27]This is he of whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.[28]For I say to you, Among the begotten of women none is a greater prophet than John the Immerser; and the less in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.[29]And all the people having heard, and the publicans, justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John.[30]And the Pharisees, and they pertaining to the law, rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not immersed by him.[31]And the Lord said, To whom shall I liken the men of this generation? and to whom are they like?[32]They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, We played the flute to you, and ye danced not; we lamented to you, and ye wept not.[33]For John the Immerser came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.[34]The Son of man came eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a man, a glutton, and wine-drinker, a friend of publicans and sinful.[35]And wisdom was justified of all her children.[36]And a certain one of the Pharisees asked him that he would eat with him. And having come into the Pharisee’s house, he reclined.[37]And, behold, a woman in the city, who was sinful, knowing that he is reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, having brought an alabaster box of perfumed oil,[38]And stood at his feet behind, weeping, been to wet his feet with tears, and wiped with the hairs of her head; and she kissed his feet, and anointed with the perfumed oil.[39]And the Pharisee having called him, seeing, said within himself, This, if he were a prophet, had known who and what race of woman which had touched him: for she is sinful.[40]And Jesus having answered, said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, Teacher, speak.[41]Two debtors were to a certain money-lender: one owed five hundred drachmas, and the other fifty.[42]And they not having to pay, he bestowed as a gift upon both. Which of them therefore will love him the more? Say thou.[43]And Simon, having answered, said, I suppose, that to whom he bestowed more favor. And he said to him, Thou hast judged rightly,[44]And having turned to the woman, he said to Simon, Thou seest this woman? I came into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: and she wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.[45]Thou gavest me no kiss: and she from when I came in left not kissing my feet.[46]Thou anointedst not my head with oil: and she anointed my feet with perfumed oil.[47]For which I say to thee, Her many sins are remitted; for she loved much: and he to whom little is remitted, loves little.[48]And he said to her, Thy sins are remitted.[49]And they reclining together began to say in themselves, Who is this who also remits sins?[50]And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.","Luke.8":"[1]And it was afterwards, and he passed through city and town proclaiming and announcing good news, the kingdom of God; and the twelve with him,[2]And certain women, who were cured from evil spirits and weaknesses, Mary called Magdalene, from whom went forth seven demons,[3]And Joanna wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who served him from possessions to them.[4]And a great crowd being together, and coming to him in the city, he spake by a parable:[5]The sower went out to sow his seed; and in his sowing, some truly fell by the way, and was trodden down, and the fowls of heaven devoured it.[6]And other fell upon a rock; and having brought forth, was dried up, for it had no moisture.[7]And other fell in the midst of thorns; and the thorns grew together and choked it.[8]And other fell upon good earth; and having brought forth, made fruit, a hundredfold. Saying these, he called out, He having ears to hear, let him hear.[9]And his disciples asked him, saying, What may this parable be?[10]And he said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: and to the rest in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.[11]And this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.[12]And they by the way are they hearing; then comes the devil, and takes away the word from their heart, lest having believed, they should be saved.[13]And they upon the rock, who, when they hear, with joy receive the word; and they have no root, who for a time believe, and in time of trial fly away.[14]And that having fallen into thorns, and they are they having heard, and with cares and riches, and pleasures of life going forth, are choked, and bring not to maturity.[15]And that in the good earth, they are they which, in a fair and good heart, having heard, keep the word, and bring forth fruit with patience.[16]None, having lighted a light, covers it with a vessel, or puts under a bed; but sets upon a candlestick, that they entering might see the light.[17]For there is nothing hid, which should not be made manifest; nor concealed, which should not be made known, and come clear.[18]See therefore how ye hear: for whoever should have, shall be given him; and whoever should not have, and what he seems to have shall be taken away from him.[19]And his mother and brethren approached to him; and they could not come to him for the crowd.[20]And it was announced to him, saying, Thy mother and thy brethren have stood without, wishing to see thee.[21]And he having answered, said unto them, My mother and my brethren are they hearing the word of God, and doing it.[22]And it was in one of the days, and he went into a ship, and his disciples: and he said to them, Let us pass through to the other side of the lake. And they led forth.[23]And they sailing, he fell asleep: and a hurricane of wind came down upon the lake; and they were filled, and were in peril.[24]And having come near, they awoke him, saying, Ruler ruler, we perish. And having risen, he censured the wind and heaving of water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.[25]And he said to them, Where is your faith And having feared, they wondered, saying to one another, Who then is this! that also commands the winds and the waters, and they listen to him![26]And they sailed over to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.[27]And he coming upon land, a certain man met him from the city, who had demons of long times, and put on no garment, and abode not in a house, but in the tombs.[28]And having seen Jesus and cried out, he fell before him, and with a great voice said, What to me and thee, Jesus, Son of God most high? I implore thee, thou wouldst not torment me.[29]For he proclaimed to the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it snatched him: and he was bound with chains, and being guarded with fetters; and bursting the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.[30]And Jesus asked him, saying, What is the name to thee? And he said, Legion: for many demons came into him.[31]And he besought him that he would not command him to go away into the abyss.[32]And a herd of numerous swine was there feeding on the mount: and they besought him that he would permit them to come into the swine. And he permitted them.[33]And the demons having come out of the man, came into the swine: and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake, and were choked.[34]And they feeding, having seen that done, fled, and having departed, proclaimed in the city and in the fields.[35]And they went out to see that done; and came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting clothed, and being of sound mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.[36]And they, having seen, proclaimed to them how he possessed with a demon was saved.[37]And all the multitude of the country round about, of the Gadarenes, asked him to depart from them; for they were held fast by great fear: and he having gone into the ship, returned.[38]And the man from whom the demons had gone out implored him to be with him: and Jesus loosed him, saying,[39]Return to thy house and recount what God did to thee. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus did to him.[40]And it was in Jesus’ returning, the crowd received him; for all were expecting him.[41]And, behold, a man came, to whom the name of Jairus, and he was ruler of the assembly: and having fallen before the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house:[42]For an only daughter was to him, of about twelve years, and she was dying. And in his going the crowds pressed him.[43]And a woman being in a flowing of blood for twelve years, who having expended all the means of subsistence upon physicians, could not be cured by any.[44]Having come near behind, touched the hem of his garment: and immediately her flow of blood was stopped.[45]And Jesus said; Who having touched me? And all denying, Peter said, and they with him: Ruler, the crowds hold with thee and press thee, and thou sayest, Who having touched me?[46]And Jesus said, Somebody touched me: for I know power having gone out from me.[47]And the woman having seen that she was not hid, came trembling, and having fallen before him, announced to him before all people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.[48]And he said to her. Take courage, Daughter: thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.[49]He yet speaking, there comes a certain of the ruler of the assembly, saying to him, That thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.[50]And Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be saved.[51]And having come into the house, he suffered not any to come in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.[52]And all wept, and bewailed her: and he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeping.[53]And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.[54]And he having cast all without, and held firmly her hand, called, saying, Child, arise.[55]And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he ordered to give her to eat.[56]And her parents were affected in mind: and he proclaimed to them, to tell no one that having been done.","Luke.9":"[1]And having called together his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.[2]And he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God, and heal the sick.[3]And he said to them, Take away nothing for the way, neither rods, nor wallet, nor bread, nor silver; nor to have two coats apiece.[4]And into whatever house ye come in, remain there, and come out thence.[5]And as many as should not receive you, having come out of that city, and shake off the cloud of dust from your feet for testimony against them.[6]And having gone out, they went through the towns, proclaiming the good news, and healing every where.[7]And Herod the tetrarch heard all done by him: and was in perplexity, for it was said by certain, that John had been raised from the dead.[8]And by certain, that Elias has appeared; and by others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was risen.[9]And Herod said, John I beheaded and who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.[10]And the sent, having returned, recounted to him what they did. And having taken them, he retreated apart in a desert place of the city, called Bethsaida.[11]And the crowds having known, followed him: and having received them, he spake to them, of the kingdom of God, and healed them having need of cure.[12]And the day began to decline: and the twelve having come near, said to him, Loose the crowd, that having departed into the towns round about and the fields, they might rest, and might find provisions; for here are we in a deserted place.[13]And he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, There are no more to us than five loaves and two fishes; except having gone we buy food for all this people.[14]For they were about five thou sand men. And he said to his disciples, Place them reclining by fifty in a place for reposing.[15]And they did so, and they made all recline.[16]And having taken the five loaves and two fishes, having looked up to heaven, be praised them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.[17]And they all ate, and were satisfied: and that over and above having remained to them was taken up, twelve baskets of fragments.[18]And it was in his being alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom do the crowds say me to be?[19]And they having answered, said, John the Immerser; and others, Elias; and others, that a certain prophet of the ancients has risen up.[20]And he said to them, And whom say ye me to be? And Peter having answered said, The Christ of God.[21]And he having censured them, enjoined them to tell this to no one;[22]Saying, That the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the more ancient and the chief priests and the scribes, and be slain, and be raised up the third day.[23]And he said to all, If any one wish to come after me, let him deny himself, and lift up his cross daily and let him follow me.[24]For whoever would wish to save his soul shall lose it: and whoever should lose his soul for my sake, the same shall save it.[25]For what is a man profited, having gained the whole world, and having lost himself, or having been damaged?[26]For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he should come in the glory of himself, and of the Father, and of the holy messengers.[27]And I say to you truly, certain are standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they should see the kingdom of God.[28]And it was after these words about eight days, and having taken Peter and John and James, he went up into the mount to pray.[29]And it was in his praying, the look of his face was another, and his clothing white, shooting forth lightning.[30]And, behold, two men were speaking with him, which were Moses and Elias:[31]Who, having been seen in glory spake of his exit which he was about to complete in Jerusalem.[32]And Peter and they with him were heavy with sleep: and having waked, they saw his glory, and two men standing with him.[33]And it was in their having withdrawn from him, Peter said to Jesus, Ruler, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he says.[34]And he saying these things, there was a cloud, and it overshadowed them: and they were afraid in their going into the cloud.[35]And there was a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear him.[36]And in there having been a voice, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and announced nothing to any one in those days, of what they had seen.[37]And it was in the day following, they having come down from the mountain, there met him a great crowd.[38]And, behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I implore thee look upon my son: for he is my only born.[39]And, behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out; and it tears him with foam, and with difficulty withdraws from him, bruising him.[40]And I implored thy disciples that they cast it out; and they could not.[41]And Jesus having answered said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you, and endure you I Bring hither thy son.[42]And he yet coming near, the demon rent him, and tare him. And Jesus censured the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.[43]And all were struck with amazement at the majesty of God. And all wondering at all which he did, Jesus said to his disciples,[44]Put ye these words into your ears: for the Son of man is about to be delivered up into the bands of men.[45]And they knew not this word, and it was hid from them, lest they should understand it: and they feared to ask him concerning this word.[46]And there came up a conference among them, thus, which of them should be the greatest.[47]And Jesus, having seen the reflection of their heart, having taken up a child, set it by himself,[48]And he said to them, Whoever should receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives him having sent me: for he being less among you all, the same shall be great.[49]And John having answered said, Ruler, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name; and we hindered him, because he follows not with us.[50]And Jesus said, Hinder him not: for who is not against us is for us.[51]And it was in the days of his acceptation being completed, and he fixed his face to go into Jerusalem.[52]And he sent messengers before his face: and having gone, they came into a town of Samaritans, in order to prepare for him.[53]And they received him not, for his face was going to Jerusalem.[54]And his disciples James and John having seen, said, O Lord, wilt thou that we should speak fire to come down from heaven, and destroy them, as also did Elias?[55]And having turned he censured them, and said, Ye know not of what sort of spirit ye are.[56]For the Son of man came not to destroy men’s souls, but to save them. And they proceeded into another town:[57]And it was, they going in the way, a certain one said to him, I will follow thee wherever thou shouldest go forth, Lord.[58]And Jesus said to him, Foxes have dens, and fowls of heaven encampments; but the Son of man has not where he might lay down the head.[59]And he said to another, Follow me. And he said, Lord, permit me having gone, first to inter my father.[60]And Jesus said to him, Permit the dead to inter their own dead; and thou, having gone, announce the kingdom of God.[61]And another said, I will follow thee, Lord; and first permit me to take leave of those in my house.[62]And Jesus said to him, No one putting his hand upon the plough, and looking back, is adapted to the kingdom of God.","Luke.10":"[1]And after these the Lord showed forth other seventy, and sent them together two and two before his face into every city and place, where he was about to come.[2]Then said he to them, Truly the harvest much, and the laborers few: implore therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.[3]Retire: behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.[4]Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor shoes: and greet none by the way.[5]And in whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house.[6]And if truly the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: and if not so, it shall turn back to you.[7]And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things of them: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.[8]And in whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat the things set before you.[9]And cure the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.[10]And in whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, having gone into its spacious ways, say,[11]And the dust having cleaved to us from your city, we wipe off to you but know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn nigh to you.[12]And I say to you, that it shall be more supportable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.[13]Woe to thee Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida! for if in Tyre and Sidon were the powers having been in you, long since had they changed the mind, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.[14]But for Tyre and Sidon shall it be more supportable in judgment, than for you.[15]And thou, Capernaum, indeed even lifted up to heaven, shalt be cast down to hades.[16]He hearing you hears me: and he rejecting you rejects me; and he rejecting me rejects him having sent me.[17]And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, and the demons are subject to us in thy name.[18]And he said to them, I saw Satan as lightning fallen from heaven.[19]Behold, I give you power to tread above serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall hurt you.[20]But in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, that your names were written in the heavens.[21]In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I will acknowledge to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes: yes Father, for so was it benevolence before thee.[22]All things were delivered me by my Father: and none knows who is the Son, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and to whomsoever the Son would wish to reveal.[23]And having turned to the disciples apart he said, Happy the eyes seeing what ye see:[24]For I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to behold what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.[25]And, behold, a certain skilled in the law stood up, tempting him, and saying, Teacher, what having done shall I inherit eternal life?[26]And he said to him, What has been written in the law? how readest thou?[27]And he having answered, said. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole strength; and thy neighbor as thyself.[28]And he said to him, Thou hast answered rightly; this do and thou shalt live.[29]And he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?[30]And Jesus having replied said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers: and having stripped him, and laid on blows, they departed, leaving him half dead.[31]And by accident a certain priest went down in that way: and having seen him, went on the opposite side.[32]And likewise also a Levite, having been in the place, having come and seen him, went on the opposite side.[33]And a certain Samaritan, traveling, came to him: and having seen him, felt compassion.[34]And having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and having mounted him upon his own animal, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.[35]And upon the morrow, he having come forth, taking out two drachmas, he gave to the inn-keeper, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest besides, I, in my coming back, will repay thee.[36]Which then of these three seems to thee to have been neighbor to him fallen among robbers?[37]And he said, He having done mercy with him. Then said Jesus to him. Go thou, and do likewise.[38]And it was in their going forth, and he came to a certain town: and a certain woman by the name of Martha received him in her house.[39]And also a sister was to her, called Mary; and she having sat at Jesus’ feet, heard his word.[40]And Martha was perplexed about much service, and having stood before, said, Lord, carest thou not that my sister left me to serve alone? Speak therefore to her that she may lay hold and assist with me.[41]And Jesus having answered, said to her, Martha, Martha, thou hast care, and art confused about many things:[42]And of one thing there is need: and Mary has chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her.","Luke.11":"[1]And it was in his being in a certain place praying, when he ceased, a certain of his disciples said to him Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.[2]And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father he in the heavens, Holy be thy name. Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be, as in heaven, also upon the earth.[3]Give us our bread sufficient for sustenance by the day.[4]And remit to us our sins; for we ourselves also remit to everyone indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil.[5]And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and should say to him. Friend, lend me three loaves;[6]Since my friend has come to me from the way, and I have not what I may set before him?[7]And he within, having answered, should say, offer not weariness to me: already has the door been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot having risen, give thee.[8]I say to you, If also having risen he will not give him because of being his friend, yet for his effrontery, having risen, he will give him as many as he needs.[9]And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.[10]For every one asking, receives; and he seeking, finds; and to him knocking, it shall be opened.[11]And shall a son ask bread of any of you a father, will he give him a stone? And if a fish, for a fish he will not give him a serpent.[12]Or also if he ask an egg, he will not give him a scorpion.[13]If then ye, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children; how much more the Father, he from heaven, will give the Holy Spirit to them asking him?[14]And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it was the demon having come out, the dumb spake; and the crowds wondered.[15]And certain of them said. By Beelzebul ruler of demons he casts out demons.[16]And others, tempting, sought a sign of him from heaven.[17]And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is rendered desolate; and a house against a house falls.[18]And if Satan also be divided against himself, how should his kingdom stand? for ye say by Beelzebul I cast out demons.[19]And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast, out? for this shall they be your judges.[20]And if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then has the kingdom of God got beforehand to you.[21]When the strong, completely armed, should watch his court-yard, his possessions are in peace:[22]And when a stronger than he, having come, conquers him, he takes away his complete armor in which he trusted, and distributes his spoils.[23]He not being with me is against me: and he not gathering with me scatters.[24]When the unclean spirit comes out from a man, he passes through places wanting water, seeking rest; and not finding, he says, I will return to my house whence I came out.[25]And having come, he finds it swept and set in order.[26]Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself; and having entered, they dwell there: and the last things of that man are worse than the first.[27]And it was in his speaking these things, a certain woman of the crowd, having lifted up the voice, said to him, in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts. Happy the womb having borne thee, and breasts thou didst suck.[28]And he said, Rather, happy they hearing the word of God, and watching it.[29]And crowds being collected, he began to say, This is an evil generation: it seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.[30]For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall be the Son of man to this generation.[31]The queen of the south shall be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, more than Solomon here.[32]The Ninevite men shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it: for they repented at the proclamation of Jonas; and, behold, more than Jonas here.[33]And none, having lighted a lamp, puts in secret, neither under a bushel, but upon the chandelier, that they coming in should see the light.[34]The light of the body is the eye; when therefore thine eye be plain, also thy whole body is clear: and when it be evil, also thy body dark.[35]Take heed therefore lest the light in thee be darkness.[36]If therefore thy whole body clear, not having any part dark, the whole shall be clear, as when a lamp enlightens thee with its gleam.[37]And in the speaking, a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him: and having come in he reclined.[38]And the Pharisee having seen, wondered that he was not first washed before dinner.[39]And the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and trencher; and your inside is full of plunder and wickedness.[40]O foolish, has not he having made the outside, also made the inside?[41]But of the things being, give alms; and, behold, all things are clean to you.[42]But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe spearmint and rue and every plant, and ye pass by the judgment and love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to have left those.[43]Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the first seat in assemblies, and greetings in market-places.[44]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as concealed tombs, and men walking above know not.[45]And a certain of the skilled in the law having answered, said, Teacher, speaking these things, and thou injurest us.[46]And he said, And woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye load men with loads difficult to carry, and ye yourselves touch not one of the fingers to the load.[47]Woe to you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.[48]Surely ye testify and assent to your fathers works: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their tombs.[49]And for this said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and the sent, and of them shall they kill and drive out:[50]That the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world be required of this generation;[51]From the blood of Abel even to the blood of Zacharias perishing between the altar and house: yea, I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.[52]Woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye came not in yourselves, and those coming in ye hindered.[53]And he saying these things to them, the scribes and Pharisees began to hold on greatly, and to put questions to him of many things:[54]Laying wait for him, and seeking to seize something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.","Luke.12":"[1]Upon which, myriads of the crowd having been gathered together, so as to tread upon one another, he began to speak to his disciples first, Keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.[2]And there is nothing covered, which shall not be revealed; and secret which shall not be known.[3]Therefore whatever ye have said in darkness shall be heard in light; and what ye spake to the ear in storehouses shall be proclaimed upon house-tops.[4]And I say to you, my friends, Be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these not having anything remaining to do.[5]And I will shew you whom ye should fear: Fear him having power, after killing, to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, Fear him.[6]Are not five little sparrows sold for two small coins, and one of them is not forgotten before God?[7]But also the hairs of your head were all numbered. Therefore fear not: ye have the preeminence over many little sparrows.[8]And I say to you, Every one who should acknowledge in me before men, also the Son of man will acknowledge in him before the messengers of God.[9]And he having denied me before men, shall he denied before the messengers of God.[10]And every one who shall say a word against the Son of man, it shall be remitted to him: and to him blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be remitted.[11]And when they bring you to assemblies, and beginnings, and powers, have no anxiety how or what ye allege for justification, or what ye say:[12]For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what ye must say.[13]And a certain one out of the crowd said to him, Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.[14]And he said to him, Man, who appointed me judge or distributer over you.[15]And he said to them, See, and watch yourselves from covetousness: for not in the abounding to any one of his possessions is his life.[16]And he spake a parable to them, saying, The farm of a certain rich man bore well:[17]And he calculated in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have not where I shall collect together my fruits?[18]And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my stores, and build greater; and there will I collect all my produce and my good things.[19]And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many good things laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be gladdened.[20]And God said to him, O foolish one, this night they require thy soul from thee: and what thou hast prepared, to whom shall it be?[21]So he treasuring up for himself, and not rich toward God.[22]And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Have no anxiety for your soul, what ye eat; nor for the body what ye put on.[23]The soul is more than food, and the body than clothing.[24]Consider the ravens: for they sow not neither do they reap; to them there is not store-house nor store; and God nourishes them: how much more have ye preeminence of the fowls?[25]And which of you having anxiety can add to his size one cubit?[26]If then ye cannot do the least, why have ye anxiety for the rest?[27]Consider the white lilies, how they grow; they are not wearied, neither do they spin; and I say to you, neither was Solomon in all his glory clothed as one of these.[28]And if the grass, to day being in the field and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes; how much rather you, ye of little faith?[29]And ye, seek ye not what ye eat, or what ye drink, and keep not in anxiety.[30]For all these things the nations of the world seek for: and your Father knows that ye have need of these.[31]But seek the kingdom of God; and all these shall be added to you.[32]Fear not, little flock; for your Father was contented to give you the kingdom.[33]Sell your possessions, and give alms; make to yourselves purses not growing old, an inexhaustible treasure in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts.[34]For where your treasure is, there also will be your heart.[35]Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;[36]And ye like men expecting their Lord, when he shall loose from the nuptials; that having come and knocked, they might quickly open to him.[37]Happy those servants, whom the Lord having come shall find watching; truly I say to you, he will gird himself, and make them recline, and having come he will serve them.[38]And if he should come in the second watch, and should come in the third watch, and find so, happy are those servants.[39]And know this, that if the master of the house knew what hour the thief is coming, he had watched, and not have suffered his house to be undermined.[40]And be ye therefore ready: for in the time which ye think not the Son of man is coming.[41]And Peter said to him, Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all?[42]And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, which the Lord will set over his household, to give the allowance of wheat in due time?[43]Happy that servant, which his Lord, having come, shall find so doing.[44]Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions.[45]And if that servant should say in his heart, My Lord delays to come; and should begin to strike the servants and maids, also to eat and drink, and to be intoxicated;[46]The lord of that servant shall come in a day which he expects not, and in an hour which he knows not, and he will cut him in two equal parts, and set his portion with the unbelieving.[47]And that servant having known his lord’s will, and not prepared, neither having done his will, shall be skinned with many.[48]And he not having known, and having done things worthy of blows, shall be skinned with few. And to every one to whom much was given, shall much be required of him: and with whom they have deposited much, they will ask of him the more.[49]I have come to cast fire into the earth; and what will I if it has been already lighted up![50]And I have an immersion to be immersed with; and how am I pressed together till it should be finished![51]Think ye that I came to give peace in the earth? Nay, I say to you; but rather division:[52]For from now shall five be in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.[53]Father shall be divided against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.[54]And he said to the crowds, When ye see a cloud rising from the descents, ye say quickly, A heavy shower of rain is coming; and it is so.[55]And when the south wind blowing, ye say, That there will be heat; and it is.[56]O hypocrites, ye know to judge the face of the earth and of heaven; and how do ye not judge this time?[57]And why also of yourselves judge ye not the just thing?[58]For when thou retirest with thine adversary to the ruler, in the way give labor to be released from him; lest he drag thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the avenger, and the avenger cast thee into prison.[59]I say to thee, thou shouldest not come out thence, even till also thou shouldest give back the last small coin.","Luke.13":"[1]And certain were present in that time announcing to him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.[2]And Jesus having answered, said to them, Think ye that these Galileans were sinful above all the Galileans, because they have suffered such things?[3]No, I say to you: but except ye should change the mind, ye shall all likewise perish.[4]Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that these were debtors above all men dwelling in Jerusalem?[5]No, I say: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.[6]And he spake this parable: A certain had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it, and found not.[7]And he said to the vine-dresser, Behold, three years I am come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find not: cut it off; wherefore also does it leave the earth unemployed?[8]And he having answered says to him, Lord, let it go also this year, till I shall dig round it, and cast dung:[9]Whereas also it might bear fruit: and if not, afterwards thou shalt cut it off.[10]And he was teaching in one of the assemblies in the sabbaths.[11]And, behold, there was a woman having a spirit of weakness eighteen years, and was bent together, and not able wholly to lift up the head.[12]And having seen her, Jesus called to, and said to her, Woman, thou hast been loosed from thy weakness.[13]And he put his hands on her: and immediately she was set upright, and honoured God.[14]And the ruler of the assembly having answered, feeling pain because Jesus cured on the sabbath, said to the crowd, Six days there are in which they ought to work; in those therefore, coming, be ye cured, and not the day of the sabbath.[15]Then answered the Lord and said, Hypocrite, does not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the stall, and leading away, give to drink?[16]And this being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, behold, eighteen years, ought she not to be loosed from this bond the day of the sabbath[17]And he saying these things, all opposed to him were ashamed: and the crowd rejoiced for all the glorious things done by him.[18]And he said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it?[19]It is like a kernel of mustard, which a man having taken, cast into his garden; and it grew, and became into a great tree; and the fowls of heaven encamped in its young shoots.[20]And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?[21]It is like leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of wheaten flour, until the whole was leavened.[22]And he went through cities and towns, teaching, and making his passage to Jerusalem.[23]And a certain said to him, Lord, if few saved? And he said to them,[24]Strive earnestly to enter through the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.[25]From the time when the master of the house should rise up, and shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us: and having answered, he will say to you, I know not whence ye are:[26]Then will ye begin to say, We ate and drank before thee, and thou didst teach in our streets.[27]And he will say, I say to you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workmen of iniquity.[28]Weeping shall be there and gnashing of teeth, when ye see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you cast without.[29]And they shall come from the risings, and the settings, and from north, and south, and they shall recline in the kingdom of God.[30]And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.[31]In the same day certain Pharisees came near, saying to him, Come out, and go from thence: for Herod wishes to kill thee.[32]And he said to them, Having gone, say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and complete cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I am completed.[33]But I must go to day and to morrow and the following: for it is not possible for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem.[34]Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets, and striking with stones those having been sent to her; how often I wished to gather thy children together, which manner a hen her young brood under the wings, and ye would not![35]Behold, your house is left to you a desert: and truly I say to you, That ye should not see me, until it should come when ye say, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord.","Luke.14":"[1]And it was in his coining into the house of a certain of the Pharisees in the sabbath to eat bread, and they were observing him narrowly.[2]And, behold, a certain dropsical man was before him.[3]And Jesus having answered, said to those skilled in the law and the Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to cure in the sabbath?[4]And they were silent. And having taken, he healed, and loosed him.[5]And having answered, he said to them, Whose ass or ox of yours shall fall into a well, and will he not quickly pull it out on the sabbath day?[6]And they were not able to answer him in turn to these things.[7]And he spake a parable to the called, fixing his attention how they chose out the first places at table; saying to them,[8]When thou art called to the nuptials, thou shouldest not recline in the first place at table; lest a more honourable than thou be called by him:[9]And he having called thee and him, having come, shall say to thee, Give place to this; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take possession of the last place.[10]But when thou art called, having gone, recline in the last place; that when he having called thee come, might say to thee, Friend, mount up higher; then shall honour be to thee before them reclining with thee.[11]For whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be exalted.[12]And he also said to him having called him, When thou makest a breakfast or supper, call not thy friends, nor thy rich neighbors, nor thy brethren; lest they call thee in return, and a giving back be to thee.[13]But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:[14]And happy shalt thou be; for they have not to give back to thee: for it shall be given back to thee at the rising up of the just.[15]And a certain of them having reclined together, having heard these things, said to him, Happy he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.[16]And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper and called many;[17]And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to the called, Come; for all things are already prepared.[18]And from one they all began to conciliate. The first said to him, I bought a field, and have necessity to go and see it: I ask thee, have me pardoned.[19]And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I ask thee, have me pardoned.[20]And another said, I have married wife, and therefore I cannot come.[21]And approaching, that servant announced to his lord these things. Then the master of the house, angry, said to his servant, Go forth quickly into the streets and quarters of the city, and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.[22]And the servant said, Lord, it has been done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is place.[23]And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the ways and hedges, and compel to come in, that my house may be filled up.[24]For I say to you, That none of those men called shall taste of my supper.[25]And great crowds went with him, and having turned he said to them.[26]If any come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, and yet also his own life, he cannot be my disciple.[27]And whoever lifts not his cross, and comes after me, cannot be my disciple.[28]For which of you, wishing to build a tower, not first, having sat down, calculates the expense, if he have things for completion?[29]That lest, having set the foundation, and not able to finish, all seeing begin to mock him,[30]Saying, That this man began to build, and was not able to finish.[31]Or what king, going to fight with another king in war, not, having sat down first, consults, if he be able with ten thousand to meet him coming with twenty thousand against him?[32]And if he, yet being far off, having sent an embassy, asks things for peace.[33]So then, every one of you, who renounces not all of his possessions, cannot be my disciple.[34]Salt good: but if salt be rendered insipid, with what shall it be fitted?[35]Neither for the land, nor is it fitted for the dunghill; they cast it without. He having ears to hear, let him hear.","Luke.15":"[1]And all publicans and sinful were drawing near him to hear him.[2]And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, That this receives the sinful, and eats together with them.[3]And he spake this parable to them, saying,[4]What man of you, having one hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, leaves not the ninety-nine in the desert, and goes for the one lost, till he find it.[5]And having found, he puts upon his shoulders, rejoicing.[6]And having come into the house, he calls together friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me: for I have found my lost sheep.[7]I say to you, that so shall joy be in heaven over one sinful repenting, more than over ninety-nine just, which have no need of repentance.[8]Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, lights not a lamp, and sweeps the house, and seeks diligently till she should find?[9]And having found, she calls together female friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me; for I found the drachma which I lost.[10]So, I say to you, joy is in heaven before the messengers of God for one sinful changing the mind.[11]And he said, A certain man had two sons:[12]And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the portion of property falling. And he divided to them the property.[13]And not many days after, having gathered all things, the younger son went abroad into a far off country, and there disposed his property, living in a profligate manner.[14]And having spent all things, a powerful famine was in that country; and he began to be in want.[15]And having gone, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into the fields to feed swine.[16]And he eagerly desired to fill his belly with the fruits of the horntree which the swine ate: and none gave to him.[17]And having come to himself, he said, Many hired of my father abound in loaves, and I am perishing with hunger![18]Having risen, I will go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,[19]And I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired.[20]And having risen, he came to his father. And yet being far off, his father saw him, and felt compassion, and having run, fell upon his neck, and kissed him.[21]And the son said to him, Father, I sinned against heaven, and before thee, and I am no more worthy to be called thy son.[22]And the father said to his servants, Bring out the first robe, and clothe him; and give a ring for his hand, and shoes for the feet:[23]And having brought the fatted calf, sacrifice, and eating, let us be gladdened.[24]For this my son was dead, and has returned to life; and he was lost, and found. And they began to be gladdened.[25]And his elder son was in the field: and coming, as he drew near the house, he heard a concert of music, and dances.[26]And having called one of his servants, he inquired what these may be.[27]And he said to him, That thy brother has come, and thy father has sacrificed the fatted calf; because he received him in good health.[28]And he was angry and would not go in; then his father having come out, besought him.[29]And he having answered said to the father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never at any time passed by thy command: and never hast thou given me a kid, that I might be gladdened with my friends.[30]And when this thy son, devouring thy property with harlots, came, thou hast sacrificed for him the fattened calf.[31]And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and all mine are thine.[32]And to be gladdened, and to rejoice, was fitting: for this thy brother was dead, and has returned to life; and he was lost, and found.","Luke.16":"[1]And he said to his disciples, A certain man was rich, who had a steward; and he was slandered to him as dispersing his goods.[2]And having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear of thee give back the word of thy stewardship; for thou canst no more be steward.[3]And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away the stewardship from me: I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.[4]I have resolved what I will do, that, when I should be removed from the stewardship, they might receive me in their houses.[5]And having called upon each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord.[6]And he said, An hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take thou thy book, and having quickly sat down, write fifty.[7]Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy book, and write eighty.[8]And the Lord praised the steward of injustice, because he did wisely: for the sons of this life are wiser than the children of light in their generation.[9]And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of injustice; that, when ye fail, they might receive you into lasting tents.[10]He faithful in the least, is also faithful in much: and he unjust in the least, is also unjust in much.[11]If therefore ye were not faithful in the unjust mammon, who shall trust to you the true?[12]And if ye were not faithful with another, who shall give you your own?[13]No servant can serve two lords: for he will either hate one, and love the other; or he will hold firmly to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.[14]And the Pharisees heard all these things, being avaricious: and they derided him.[15]And he said to them, Ye are they justifying yourselves before men; and God knows your hearts: for the high with men is abomination before God.[16]The law and the prophets until John: from then the kingdom of God announces good news, and every one is forced into it.[17]And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one horn of the law to fall.[18]Every one loosing his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery: and every one marrying her having been loosed from the husband commits adultery.[19]A certain man was rich, and was clothed in purple and fine linen, being daily splendidly gladdened:[20]And there was a certain beggar, Lazarus by name, who was cast at his gate, having been wounded,[21]And eagerly desirous to be fed from crumbs falling from the rich one’s table: but also the dogs, coming, licked off his wounds.[22]And it was, the beggar died, and was carried by messengers into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich one died also, and was buried;[23]And in hades, having lifted up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham from far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.[24]And he having called out, said, Father Abraham, pity me, and send Lazarus, that he might dip his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.[25]But Abraham said, Child, remember that thou didst receive thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus likewise evil things: and now here is he comforted, and thou art tormented.[26]And besides all these, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed: so that they wishing to pass through thence to you could not; neither could they cross over from thence to us.[27]And he said, Then I ask thee, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:[28]For I have five brethren; that he might testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.[29]Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.[30]And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if some one from the dead go to them, they will change the mind.[31]And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither if any rise from the dead, will they be persueded.","Luke.17":"[1]And he said to the disciples, It is impossible there come not causes of offence: and woe, through whom they come![2]It is profitable to him if the millstone of an ass were placed about his neck, and he cast into the sea, rather than he should offend one of these little ones.[3]Attend to yourselves: and if thy brother sin against thee, censure him; and if he should repent, let him go.[4]And if seven times in a day he sin against thee, and seven times in a day turn back to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt let him go.[5]And the sent said to the Lord, Add faith to us.[6]And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a kernel of mustard, said ye to this mulberry-tree, Be thou rooted up, and planted in the sea; and it had listened to you.[7]And which of you having a servant ploughing or feeding, who will say to him having come out of the field, Quickly having come, recline?[8]But will he not say to him, Prepare what I shall sup, and, being girded, serve me, till I eat and drink; and after these, thou mayest eat and drink?[9]He has no favor to that servant, for he did the things appointed. I think not.[10]So also ye, when ye do all appointed you, say, That we are useless servants: for what we ought to do, we have done.[11]And it was in his going to Jerusalem, and he came through the land of Samaria and Galilee.[12]And he coming to a certain town, ten leprous men met him, who stood far off:[13]And they lifted up the voice, saying, Jesus, faster, pity us.[14]And having seen, he said to them, Having gone, show yourselves to the priests. And it was in their retiring they were cleansed.[15]And one of them, having seen that he was healed, turned back, with a great voice honouring God.[16]And he fell upon the face at his feet, thanking him: and he was a Samaritan.[17]And Jesus having answered said, Were not ten cleansed? and where the nine?[18]They were not found returning to give glory to God, except this of another race.[19]And he said to him, Having risen, go: thy faith has saved thee.[20]And having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:[21]Neither shall they say, Behold here or, behold there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.[22]And he said to the disciples, The days come when ye shall eagerly desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see.[23]And they shall say to you, Behold here, or; behold there: go not away, nor pursue.[24]For as lightning, flashing out from that under heaven, shines to that under heaven; so also shall be the Son of man in his day.[25]And first must he suffer many things, and be disapproved of by this generation.[26]And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be in the days of the Son of man.[27]They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day which Noe came into the ark, and the overflow came, and destroyed all.[28]And likewise as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;[29]And the day which Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all.[30]According to these shall be the day in which the Son of man is revealed.[31]In that day, whoever shall be upon the house, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he in the fields, likewise let him not turn back behind.[32]Remember Lot’s wife.[33]Whoever should seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose it, shall preserve it alive.[34]I say to you, that night shall be two upon one bed; one shall be taken, and the other let go.[35]Two females shall be grinding together; one shall be taken, and the other let go.[37]And having answered, they say to him, Where, Lord And he said to them, Where the body, there shall the eagles be gathered together.","Luke.18":"[1]And he spake to them a parable, that they must always pray, and not lose courage;[2]Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city, fearing not God, and not occupied about man:[3]And a widow was in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.[4]And he would not for a time: and after these he said in himself, And if I fear not God, and am not occupied about man;[5]Yet because this widow produces fatigue to me, I will avenge her, lest in the end, coming, she give me a blow under the eyes.[6]And the Lord said, Hear ye what the judge of injustice says.[7]And shall not God do the avenging of his chosen, crying to him day and night, being slow to anger toward them?[8]I say to you, that he will do their avenging swiftly. But the Son of man having come, shall he find faith upon earth[9]And he spake to certain trusting upon themselves that they were just, and setting at nought the rest, this parable:[10]Two men went up to the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.[11]The Pharisee having stood, prayed these to himself, O God, I return thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or also as this publican.[12]I fast twice of the Sabbath; I pay tithes of all I possess.[13]And the publican, standing afar off, would not either lift up the eyes to heaven, but struck upon his breast, saying, God propitiate for me the sinful.[14]I say to you, this one went down to his house justified rather than that one: for every one lifting up himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be lifted up.[15]And they also brought babes to him, that he might touch them: and the disciples having seen, censured them.[16]And Jesus having called them, said, Leave the young children to come to me, and hinder them not: for of such is time kingdom of God.[17]Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child should not enter into it.[18]And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?[19]And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good except the one God.[20]Thou knowest the commands, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, Thou shouldest not kill, Thou shouldest not steal, Thou shouldest not bear false testimony, Honour thy father and thy mother.[21]And he said, All these have I watched from my youth.[22]And Jesus having heard these, said to him, Yet one thing fails thee: all whatever thou hast, sell and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.[23]And he having heard these things, was sorely grieved: for he was very rich.[24]And Jesus having seen him being sorely grieved, said, With how much difficulty shall they having possessions come into the kingdom of God![25]For it is easier for a camel to come through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.[26]And they having heard, said, And who can be saved?[27]And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God.[28]And Peter said, Behold, we have left all, and followed thee.[29]And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there is none who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for sake of the kingdom of God,[30]Who should not receive many fold in this time, and in life coming, eternal life.[31]And taking the twelve, he said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets shall be completed to the Son of man.[32]For he shall be delivered to the nations, and be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon:[33]And having scourged, they shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise.[34]And they understood nothing of these things: and this word was hidden from them, and they discerned not the things spoken.[35]And it was in his drawing near to Jericho, a certain blind sat by the way, begging:[36]And having heard the multitude passing by, he inquired what this might be.[37]And they announced to him, That Jesus the Nazarite passes by.[38]And he cried out, saying, Jesus, son of David, pity me.[39]And they going before censured him, that he be silent: and he so much the more cried out, O son of David, pity me.[40]And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought to him: and he having drawn near, he asked him,[41]Saying, What wilt thou I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I might see again.[42]And Jesus said to him, See again: thy faith has saved thee.[43]And he immediately saw again, and followed him, honouring God: and all the people having seen, gave praise to God.","Luke.19":"[1]And having come in, he passed through Jericho.[2]And, behold, a man, called Zaccheus by name, and he was chief of the publicans, and he was rich.[3]And he sought to see Jesus, who he is; and he could not, from the crowd, for he was small in size.[4]And having run before, he went up upon an Egyptian fig tree, that he might see him: for he was about to pass through that.[5]And when he came to the place, having looked up, Jesus saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, having hastened, come down; for to day must I remain in thine house.[6]And having hasted, he came down, and received him rejoicing.[7]And all they having seen, murmured, saying, That he entered in to rest with a sinful man.[8]And Zaccheus having stood, said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have made any false accusation against any one, I give back fourfold.[9]And Jesus said to him, That to day salvation has been to this house, as he is also a son of Abraham.[10]For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.[11]And they hearing these things, having added, he spake a parable, for he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that immediately the kingdom of God is about to be rendered visible.[12]Then he said, A certain honourable man went into a country far off to take unto himself a kingdom, and to return.[13]And having called his ten servants, he gave them ten coins, and said to them, Attend to business, till I come.[14]And his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We wish not this to reign over us.[15]And it was in his coming back, having received the kingdom, and he spake to have these servants called to him, to whom he gave the silver, that he might know who had attended to any business.[16]And the first approached, saying, Lord, thy coin has gained ten coins.[17]And he said to him, Well, good servant: because thou west faithful in the least, be thou having power over ten cities.[18]And the second came saying, Lord, thy coin made five coins.[19]And he said to him, And be thou over five cities.[20]And another came saying, Lord, behold, thy coin which I have placed in a napkin:[21]For I feared thee, for thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and thou reapest what thou didst not sow.[22]And he said to him, Out of thy month will I judge thee, O evil servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I sowed not:[23]And wherefore gavest thou not my silver to the bankers, and I having come had received it with interest?[24]And to those standing by he said, Take away from him the coin, and give to him having the ten coins.[25]“They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’[26]For I say to you, That to every one having shall be given; and from him not having, and what he has shall be taken away from him.[27]But those mine enemies, not having wished me to reign over them, bring hither, and slaughter before me.[28]And having said these, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.[29]And it was as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,[30]Having said, Retire ye to the opposite town; in which entering, ye shall find a colt bound, upon which none of men at any time have sat: having loosed, bring him.[31]And if any ask you, Wherefore loose ye? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of him.[32]And the sent, having departed, found as he said to them.[33]And they loosing the colt, his lords said to them, Why loose ye the colt?[34]And they said, The Lord has need of him.[35]And they brought him to Jesus: and having cast their garments upon the colt, they placed Jesus upon.[36]And he going, they laid down their garments in the way.[37]And he already drawing near to the descent of the mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples, rejoicing, began to praise God with a great voice for all the powers which they saw;[38]Saying, Praised the king coming in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest ones.[39]And certain of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, Teacher, censure thy disciples.[40]And having answered, he said to them, I say to you, that if these should be silent, the stones shall cry out.[41]And as he drew near, having seen the city, he wept over it,[42]Saying, That if thou knewest, also thou, and also in this thy day, the things for thy peace! and now have they been hid from thine eyes.[43]For the days shall come upon thee, and thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and keep thee together from all sides,[44]And they shall level thee with the ground, and thy children in thee; they shall not leave in thee stone upon stone; because thou knewest not the time of thine inspection.[45]And having come into the temple, he began to cast out them selling and buying in it;[46]Saying to them, It has been written, My house is the house of prayer: and ye have made it a den of robbers.[47]And he was teaching in the day in the temple. And the chief priests and scribes and the first of the people sought to destroy him,[48]And they found not what they might do: for all the people hearing hanged on him.","Luke.20":"[1]And it was in one of those days, he teaching the people in the temple, and announcing good news, there came forth the chief priests, and the scribes, and the more ancient,[2]And they spake to him, saying, Say to us, by what authority doest thou these? or who is he having given thee this authority?[3]And having answered he said to them, I will ask you one word; and tell me:[4]Was the immersion of John of heaven, or of men.[5]And they reckoned up together to themselves, saying, That if we say, of heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?[6]And if we say, of men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded John to be a prophet.[7]And they answered not to know from whence.[8]And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these.[9]And he began to say to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it to farmers, and went abroad sufficient time.[10]And in time he sent a servant to the farmers, that they give him from the fruit of the vineyard: and the farmers, skinning, sent him out empty.[11]And he added to send another servant: and they also having skinned and dishonoured him, sent forth empty.[12]And he added to send a third; and also, having wounded, they cast him out.[13]And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do I will send my dearly beloved son: perhaps, having seen him, they will change.[14]And the farmers having seen him, reasoned to themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance be ours.[15]And having cast him without the vineyard, they killed. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?[16]He shall come and destroy these farmers, and give the vineyard to others. And having heard, they said, It may not be.[17]And having looked upon them, he said, What then is this written, The stone which the builders disapproved of, this has been for the head of the corner?[18]Every one having fallen upon that stone shall be crushed, and upon whomsoever it should fall, it shall winnow him.[19]And the chief priests and scribes sought to lay hands upon him in the same hour; and they feared the people: for they knew he spake this parable against them.[20]And having observed narrowly, they sent liers-in-wait, feigning themselves to be just, that they might seize upon his word, to deliver him to the beginning and authority of the leader.[21]And they asked him, saying. Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and thou receivest not the face, but teachest in truth the way of God:[22]Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not.[23]And having perceived their craft, he said to them, Why tempt ye me?[24]Show me drachma. Whose image and inscription has it? And having answered they said, Caesar’s.[25]And he said to them, Return therefore to Caesar, Caesar’s things, and to God the things of God.[26]And they were not able to seize upon his word before the people: and having wondered at his answer, they were silent.[27]And certain of the Sadducees having approached, speaking against there being a rising up, asked him,[28]Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one’s brother die having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed to his brother.[29]Therefore were there seven brethren: and the first having taken a wife, died without children.[30]And the second took the wife, and he died without children.[31]And the third took her; and likewise also the seven: and they left no children, and died.[32]And after all died the woman also.[33]Then in the rising up, whose wife of them is she for seven had her a wife.[34]And Jesus having answered, said to them, The sons of this life marry, and are given in marriage.[35]And they having been deemed worthy to obtain that life, and the rising up of the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:[36]For neither can they die any more: for they are like to messengers; and are sons of God, being the sons of the rising up.[37]And that the dead are raised, Moses made known at the bramble, when he calls the Lord, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.[38]And he is not God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.[39]And certain of the scribes having answered, said, Teacher, thou speakest well.[40]And they dared no more to ask him anything.[41]And he said to them, how say they Christ to be son of David?[42]And David himself says in the book of Psalms, the Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou from my right hand,[43]Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.[44]David therefore calls him Lord, and how is be his son?[45]And all the people hearing, he said to his disciples,[46]Hold from the scribes, wishing to walk about in robes, and loving greetings in the markets, and precedencies in assemblies, and the first places at tables at suppers;[47]Who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence pray at great length; these shall receive more abundant judgment.","Luke.21":"[1]And having looked up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the royal treasury.[2]And he also saw a certain poor widow casting there two small coins.[3]And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all:[4]For all they, of that abounding to them, have cast in to the gifts of God: and she from her want cast in all the living which she had.[5]And certain speaking of the temple, that it has been arranged with beautiful stones and decorations, he said,[6]These which ye see, the days shall come, in which stone shall not be left upon stone, which shall not be loosened.[7]And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these be and what the sign when these should be about to be.[8]And he said, See ye, be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and the time has drawn near: therefore go not after them.[9]And when ye hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these must first be; but the end not immediately.[10]Then said he to them, Nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:[11]And great earthquakes in places, and famines, and scourges shall be; and terrific objects and great signs shall be from heaven.[12]And before all these shall they cast their hands upon you, and drive out, delivering to assemblies, and prisons, being brought before kings and leaders for my name’s sake.[13]And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.[14]Set therefore in your hearts, not to practise beforehand to justify yourselves:[15]For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all they opposed to you shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.[16]And ye shall also be delivered up by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and they shall put of you to death.[17]And ye shall be hated by all for my name’s sake.[18]And there shall not a hair of your head perish.[19]In your patience possess ye your souls.[20]And when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its devastation has drawn near.[21]Then let those in Judea flee to the mountain; and those in the midst of her withdraw; and let those in the countries not go into her.[22]For these are the days of vengeance, that all things having been written, should be completed.[23]And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck, in those days! for there shall be great necessity upon the land, and anger upon this people.[24]And they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and they shall be made captives in all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by all the nations, till the times of the nations should be completed.[25]And signs shall be in the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and commotion resounding.[26]Men losing breath for fear and expectation of things coming on the habitable globe: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.[27]And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with much power and glory.[28]And these things beginning to be, get out of danger, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.[29]And he spake to them a parable; See the fig tree, and all trees;[30]When they should already throw forth, seeing of yourselves ye know that summer is already near.[31]So also ye, when ye see these being, know that the kingdom of God is near.[32]Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, even till all things should be.[33]Heaven and earth shall pass away: and my words shall not pass away.[34]And attend to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be loaded with dizziness, caused by excess, and drunkenness, and cares of life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.[35]For as a snare shall it come upon all remaining upon the face of all, the earth.[36]Watch therefore, in all time praying, that ye be deemed worthy to escape all these about to be, and to stand before the Son of man.[37]And the days he was teaching in the temple; and the nights, coming out, he lodged in the mount called of Olives.[38]And all the people arose early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.","Luke.22":"[1]And the festival of unleavened drew near, called the Pascha.[2]And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.[3]And Satan came into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.[4]And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and the generals, how he might deliver him to them.[5]And they rejoiced, and agreed to give him silver.[6]And he promised, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them apart from the crowd.[7]And the day of unleavened came, in which must be sacrificed the pascha.[8]And he sent Peter and John, saying, Having gone, prepare ye for us the pascha, that we might eat.[9]And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we should prepare?[10]And he said to them, Behold, you having come to the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow ye him to the house where he goes in.[11]And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the room where I should eat the pascha with my disciples?[12]And he shall shew you a great upper room spread: there prepare ye.[13]And having departed, they found as he said to them; and they prepared the pascha.[14]And when it was the hour, he reclined, and the twelve sent with him.[15]And he said to them, With eager desire have I desired to eat this pascha with you before I suffer:[16]For I say to you, no more should I eat of it, till when it should be completed in the kingdom of God.[17]Having taken the cup, and returned thanks, he said, Take this, and divide among yourselves:[18]For I say to you, that I drink not of the fruit of the vine, till when the kingdom of God comes.[19]Having taken the bread, and returned thanks, he brake, and gave them, saying, This is my body given for you: this do ye for my remembrance.[20]Likewise also the cup after supping, saying, This the cup, the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you:[21]But, behold, the hand of him delivering me up with me at the table.[22]And truly the Son of man goes according to that determined: but woe to that man by whom he is delivered up![23]And they began to seek together among themselves, which of them it should be that was about to do this thing.[24]And a love of strife was in them, which of them thinks to be the greater.[25]And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them; and they exercising power over them are called benefactors.[26]And ye not so: but let the greater with you be as the younger; and he leading, as he serving.[27]For which the greater, he reclining, or he serving? is not he reclining and I am in the midst of you as he serving.[28]And ye are they having remained with me in my temptations.[29]And I set to you, as my Father set to me, a kingdom;[30]That ye might eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and might sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.[31]And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded you, to sift as wheat:[32]And I have supplicated for thee that thy faith fail not: and thou, when having turned back, confirm thy brethren.[33]And he said to him, Lord, with thee am I ready to go, and to prison, and to death.[34]And he said, I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not utter a sound this day, before thou shalt thrice deny knowing me.[35]And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did ye want any thing? And they said, Nothing,[36]Then said he to them, But now, he having a purse, let him take up, and likewise a wallet: and he not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword.[37]For I say to you, that this written must yet be finished in me, that, Also was he reckoned with the lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.[38]And they said, Lord, behold, two swords here. And he said to them, It is enough.[39]And having come out, he went, according to custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.[40]And being at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.[41]And he was removed from them about a stone’s cast, and having placed the knees, he prayed,[42]Saying, Father, If thou art willing, turn aside this cup from me: but not my will, but thine, be done.[43]And a messenger was seen to him from heaven, strengthening him.[44]And being in a violent struggle, he prayed more intently: and his sweat was as clots of blood coming down upon the earth.[45]And having risen from prayer, having come to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief;[46]And he said to them, Why sleep ye? having risen, pray that ye might not enter into temptation.[47]And he yet speaking, Behold a crowd, and he called Judas, one of the twelve, came before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.[48]And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?[49]And they about him, having seen that, going to be, said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword.[50]And a certain one of them struck a servant of the chief priest, and took away his right ear.[51]And Jesus having answered said, Allow ye even to this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.[52]And Jesus said to the chief priests, and generals of the temple, and the elders, having come to him, Have ye come out, as upon a robber, with sword and sticks?[53]I being with you daily in the temple, ye stretched not forth the hands upon me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.[54]And having taken, they brought him into the house of the chief priest. And Peter followed him far off.[55]And having kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and they having sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.[56]And a certain young girl having seen him sitting by the light, and looked intently upon him, said, And this was with him.[57]And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.[58]And after a little another having seen him, said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.[59]And about the space of one hour a certain other assured himself, saying, of a truth this also was with him: for he is a Galilean.[60]And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, he yet speaking, the cock uttered a sound.[61]And the Lord having turned, looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, That before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.[62]And Peter having come forth without wept bitterly.[63]And the men holding Jesus mocked him, stripping.[64]And having covered him, they struck his face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy who it is having struck thee.[65]And many other things, blaspheming, they spake against him.[66]And when it was day, the council of elders of the people was gathered together, and the chief priests and scribes, and they brought him to their council,[67]Saying, Art thou Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye would not believe:[68]And if I ask you, ye would not answer me, or loose me.[69]From now shall the Son of man be sitting from the right hand of the power of God.[70]And they all said, Art thou therefore the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.[71]And they said, Why have we yet need of testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his month.","Luke.23":"[1]And all the multitude of them having risen, brought him to Pilate.[2]And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a King.[3]And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou King of the Jews? And he having answered, said to him, Thou sayest.[4]And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find nothing blameworthy in this man.[5]And they were strong, saying, That he stirs up the people, teaching through the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to here.[6]And Pilate having heard of Galilee, asked if the man is a Galilean.[7]And having known that he is from Herod’s authority, he sent him to Herod, he being in Jerusalem in those days.[8]And Herod having seen Jesus, rejoiced greatly: for he was wishing a long while since to see him, for hearing many things of him: and he hoped to see some sign done by him.[9]And he asked him in fitting words: and he answered him nothing.[10]And the chief priests and scribes stood zealously accusing him.[11]And Herod having set him at nought with his troops, and having mocked, putting about him shining clothing, sent him out to Pilate.[12]And also Pilate and Herod were friends in that day with one another: for they were before being in enmity with each other.[13]And Pilate having called together the chief priests and rulers and people,[14]Said to them, Ye have brought to me this man, as perverting the people: and, behold, I having examined him before you, have found nothing blameworthy in this man, of what things ye bring an accusation against him:[15]But neither Herod: for I sent you forth to him; and, behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.[16]Therefore, having chastised him, I will release.[18]And they cried out with the entire multitude, saying, Take this away, and loose to us Barabbas:[19]one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.[20]Again Pilate called, wishing to loose Jesus.[21]And they exclaimed, saying, Crucify, crucify him.[22]And he said to them the third time, For what evil has he done I have found no cause of death in him: therefore, having corrected him, I will loose.[23]And they were urgent with great voices, asking for him to be crucified. And their voices and the chief priests overcame.[24]And Pilate sanctioned their asking to be done.[25]And he loosed to them him cast into prison for sedition, and slaughter, which they demanded; and delivered Jesus to their will.[26]And as they led him away, seizing upon Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they laid the cross upon him, to carry after Jesus.[27]And a great multitude of people followed him, and of women, and who were lamenting bitterly, and bewailing him.[28]And having turned towards them Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.[29]For, behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and the wombs which never brought forth, and the breasts which gave not suck.[30]Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us.[31]For if they do these in the moist tree, what should be in the dry.[32]And two others who were led, evil doers, to be lifted up with him.[33]And when they came to the place called Kranium, there they crucified him, and the evil doers, truly one from the right, and one from the left.[34]And Jesus said, Father, let them go; for they know not what they do. And having divided his garments, they cast lots.[35]And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also who with them were deriding, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God.[36]And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar.[37]And saying, If thou art king of the Jews, save thyself.[38]And there was also an inscription written upon him, in letters Greek, Roman, and Hebrew; THIS IS KING OF THE JEWS.[39]And one of the evil doers hanged, blasphemed him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.[40]And the other having answered, censured him, saying, Shouldest thou not fear God, for thou art in the same judgment?[41]And truly we justly; for we receive things worthy of what we have done: and this has done nothing out of place.[42]And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou shouldest come into thy kingdom.[43]And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.[44]And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness was upon all the earth till the ninth hour.[45]And the sun was darkened, and the covering of the temple was split in the middle.[46]And Jesus having cried with a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands will I commit my spirit: and having said these, he expired.[47]And the centurion having seen that having been done, honoured God, saying, Surely this man was just.[48]And all the crowds having been to this viewing, seeing the things done, striking their breasts, returned.[49]And all his acquaintance stood afar off, and the women having followed him together from Galilee, seeing these.[50]And, behold, a man Joseph by name, being a counsellor; good and just:[51](The same was not set together in the counsel and deed of them;) from Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.[52]The same having come to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.[53]And having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and put it in a tomb cut in stone, where none was ever laid.[54]And the day was the preparation, and the sabbath shone forth.[55]And the women having followed, which had come to him out of Galilee, saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.[56]And having returned, they prepared spices and perfumed oils; and truly the sabbath were they at rest according to the command.","Luke.24":"[1]And in one of the sabbaths, in the depth of the dawn of day, they came to the tomb, bringing spices which they had prepared, and certain with them.[2]And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.[3]And coming in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.[4]And it was in their being perplexed for this, and, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:[5]And they having, been afraid, and bending the face to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living with the dead.[6]He is not here, but has risen: remember how he spake to you being yet in Galilee,[7]Saying, That the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and be raised up the third day.[8]And they remembered his words,[9]And having returned from the tomb, they announced these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.[10]And they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the rest with them, who said these things to the sent.[11]And their words appeared before them as idle talk, and they believed them not.[12]And Peter having risen, ran to the tomb; and having stooped, saw the linen bandages lying alone, and he departed, wondering in himself at what was done.[13]And, behold, two of them were going in the same day to a town being about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, the name of which Emmaus.[14]And they were conversing with one another concerning all things having happened.[15]And it was in their conversing and seeking out together, and Jesus himself, having drawn near, went with them.[16]And their eyes were holden not to know him.[17]And he said to them, What words these which, walking about, ye discuss with one another, and are of gloomy aspect?[18]And one having answered, to whom the name Cleopas, said to him, Sojournest thou alone in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things done in it in these days?[19]And Jesus said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarite, who was a man, a prophet, powerful in work and words before God and all the people:[20]And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to the judgment of death, and crucified him.[21]And we hoped that this is he about to redeem Israel: but also with all these things, to day it brings the third day from which these things were.[22]And also certain women of ours moved us out of place, having been early at the tomb;[23]And not finding his body, they came, saying also to have seen a vision of messengers, who say he is living.[24]And certain of them with us departed to the tomb, and found so as the women said: and him they saw not.[25]And he said to them, O ye unwise, and slow in heart to believe in all things which the prophets spake:[26]Must not Christ suffer these things, and enter into his glory?[27]And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained clearly to them in all the writings concerning himself.[28]And they drew near to the town where they were going: and he laid claim to go still further.[29]And they constrained him, saying, Remain with us: for it is near eve, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.[30]And it was in his reclining at table with them, having taken bread, he praised, and having broken, bestowed upon them.[31]And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he was removed from their view.[32]And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us, as he spake to us in the way, and as he opened the writings to us.[33]And having risen the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those with them.[34]Saying, That truly the Lord was risen, and was seen to Simon.[35]And they recounted the things in the way, and how he was known to them in the breaking of bread.[36]And they speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and he says to them, Peace to you.[37]And they, struck with awe and being afraid, thought to see a spirit.[38]And he said to them, Why have ye been troubled? and wherefore do reflections come up in your hearts?[39]See my hands and my feet, for I am he; feel, and see: for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as ye see me having.[40]And having said this, he showed them hands and feet.[41]And yet they not believing from joy, and wondering, he said to them, Have ye any food here?[42]And they bestowed upon him part of a broiled fish, and of an honey comb.[43]And having taken, he ate before them.[44]And he said to them, These the words which I spake to you, being yet with you, for all things must be completed, written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.[45]Then opened he their understanding, to understand the writings,[46]And he said to them, That so has it been written, and so was it necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:[47]And repentance and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, having begun from Jerusalem.[48]And ye are witnesses of these things.[49]And, behold, I send the solemn promise of my Father upon you: and do ye sit in the city of Jerusalem, till ye be clothed with power from on high.[50]And he led them without, even to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he praised them.[51]And it was in his praising them, he was separated from them, and carried into heaven.[52]And they having worshipped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy.[53]And they were always in the temple, praising and extolling God. Amen.","John.1":"[1]In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.[2]This was in the beginning with God.[3]All things were by him; and without him out him was not one thing that was.[4]In him was life; and the life was the light of men.[5]And light shines in darkness; and darkness comprehended it not.[6]A man was sent from God, the name to him John.[7]This came for testimony, that he might testify concerning the Light, that all might believe through him.[8]He was not that Light, but that he might testify for the Light.[9]The Light was true, which enlightens every man coming into the world.[10]He was in the world, and the world was by him, and the world knew him not.[11]He came to his own things, and his own received him not.[12]And as many as received him, he gave them authority to be the children of God, to them believing on his name:[13]They were not born of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.[14]And the Word was flesh, and dwelt with us, (and we beheld his glory, as the glory of the only born of the Father,) full of grace and truth.[15]John testifies for him, and he tried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He coming after me was before me: for he was before me.[16]And of his completion we all received, and grace for grace.[17]For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth were by Jesus Christ.[18]None has seen God at any time; the only born Son, he being in the bosom of the Father, he has declared.[19]And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem that they might ask him, Who art thou?[20]And he acknowledged, and denied not; and he acknowledged, That I am not the Christ.[21]And they asked, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou a prophet? And he answered, No.[22]Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we might give answer to them having sent us. What sayest thou for thyself?[23]He said, I the voice of him crying in the desert, Make ye straight the way of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.[24]And they having been sent were of the Pharisees.[25]And they asked him, and said to him, Why immersest thou then, if thou art not Christ, neither Elias, neither a prophet?[26]John answered them saying, I immerse in water: but he stands the midst of you, whom ye know not;[27]This is he coming after me, who was before me, of whom I am not worthy that I might loose the strings of his shoes.[28]These things were in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was immersing.[29]In the morrow John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, be taking away the sin of the world.[30]This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who was before me: for he was before me.[31]And I knew him not: but that he might be manifested to Israel, for this I came immersing in water.[32]And John testified, saying, That I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it remained up on him.[33]And I knew him not: but he having sent me to immerse in water, this said to me, Upon whomsoever thou shouldest see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, this is he immersing in the Holy Spirit.[34]And I have seen, and testified that this is the Son of God.[35]Again on the morrow John stood, and two of his disciples;[36]And having looked upon Jesus walking, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.[37]And two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.[38]And Jesus having turned, and seen them following, says to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (It says, being interpreted, Teacher,) where remainest thou.[39]He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he remains, and they remained with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.[40]It was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, one of the two having heard of John, and followed him.[41]He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found Messias, which is, being interpreted, Christ.[42]And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus having looked upon him, said, Thou art Simon son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, interpreted, Peter.[43]The morrow Jesus wished to go forth to Galilee, and he finds Philip, and he says to him, Follow me.[44]Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.[45]And Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, we have found, Jesus, son of Joseph, him from Nazareth.[46]And Nathanael said to him, Can any good be from Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.[47]Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and he says of him, Behold truly an Israelite, in whom is no deceit![48]Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.[49]Nathanael answers and says to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.[50]Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou thou shalt see greater than these.[51]And he says to him, Amen, amen, I say to you, From henceforth shall ye see heaven opened, and the messengers of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.","John.2":"[1]And the third day was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:[2]And Jesus was also called, and his disciples, to the wedding.[3]And wine having failed, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.[4]And Jesus says to her, What to me and thee, woman mine hour comes not yet.[5]His mother says to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do.[6]And six stone water buckets were placed there, according to the purification of the Jews, containing each two or three measures.[7]Jesus says to them, Fill the water buckets with water. And they filled them even up over.[8]And he says to them, Draw now, and carry to the superintendent of the feast. And they carried.[9]And when the superintendent of the feast tasted the wine having been water, and knew not whence it is: (and the servants knew, having drawn the water;) the superintendent calls the bridegroom,[10]And says to him, Every man sets good wine first; and when they be intoxicated, then inferior: thou hast kept the good wine till now.[11]This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.[12]After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.[13]And the pascha of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,[14]And found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and money-changers sitting;[15]And having made a scourge of ropes, he cast all out of the temple, also sheep, and oxen; and poured out the small coin of money-changers, and overturned the tables;[16]And he said to those selling doves, Take away these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.[17]And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house has eaten me up.[18]Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou, that thou doest these things?[19]Jesus answered and said to them, Loose this temple, and in three days will I raise it up.[20]Then said the Jews, In forty-six years was this temple built, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?[21]But he spake concerning the temple of his body.[22]When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them; and they believed the writing, and the word which Jesus spake.[23]And when he was in Jerusalem at the pascha, in the festival, many believed in his name, beholding his signs which he did.[24]And Jesus himself trusted not himself to them, for he knew all,[25]For also he had no need that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.","John.3":"[1]And there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus the name to him, a ruler of the Jews:[2]He came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come a teacher from God: for none can do these signs which thou doest, except God be with him.[3]Jesus answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, Except any one be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.[4]Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born, being an old man? he cannot come in a second time to his mother’s belly, and be born.[5]Jesus says to him, Truly, truly, I say to thee, Except any one be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot come into the kingdom of God.[6]That born of flesh is flesh; and that born of the Spirit is spirit.[7]Thou shouldest not wonder that I said to thee, Ye must be born from above.[8]The wind, where it wills, blows, and its voice thou hearest, but thou knowest not whence it comes, and where it goes: so is every one having been born of the Spirit.[9]Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?[10]Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these?[11]Truly, truly, I say to thee, that what we know, we speak, and what we have seen we testify; and ye receive not our testimony.[12]If I spake to you earthly things, and ye believe not, how, if I speak to you heavenly things, will ye believe.[13]And none has ascended to heaven, except he having descended from heaven, the Son of man, he being in heaven.[14]And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up;[15]That every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.[17]For God sent not his Son into the world that he judge the world; but that the world might be saved through him.[18]He believing in him is not judged: and he not believing has been already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God.[19]And this is the judgment, that light has come into the world, and men rather loved darkness than light, for their works were evil.[20]For every one doing bad things hates the light, and he comes not to the light, lest his works should be rebuked.[21]But he doing the truth comes to the light, that his works might be manifested, that they are wrought in God.[22]After these Jesus came and his disciples into the Judean land; and there he tarried with them, and immersed.[23]And John was also immersing in Aenon near Salim, for many waters were there: and they came near and were immersed.[24]For John was not yet thrown into prison.[25]Then was there an investigation of John’s disciples with Jesus about purification.[26]And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou hast testified, behold, he immerses, and all come to him.[27]John answered and said, No man can receive anything except it be given him from heaven.[28]Ye yourselves testify to me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.[29]He having the bride is the bridegroom: and the friend of the bridegroom, standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy for the bridegroom’s voice: therefore this my joy has been completed.[30]He must increase, and I must be diminished.[31]He coming from above is above all, he being of the earth is of earth, and speaks of earth: he coming from heaven is above all.[32]And what he saw and heard, this be testifies: and none receives his testimony.[33]He having received his testimony has fixed a seal that God is true.[34]For he whom God sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure.[35]The Father loves the Son, and he has given all things into his hand.[36]He believing in the Son has eternal life: and he not believing the Son shall not see life, but the anger of God remains upon him.","John.4":"[1]Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John,[2](Though Jesus himself immersed not, but his disciples,)[3]He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.[4]And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.[5]Then comes he to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the place which Jacob gave to Joseph his son.[6]And Jacob’s spring was there. Then Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat thus by the spring: it was about the sixth hour.[7]A woman of Samaria comes to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.[8](For his disciples were gone into the city that they might buy food.)[9]Then says the Samaritan woman to him, How thou, being a Jew, askest of me to drink, being a Samaritan woman? for the Jews have no intercourse with the Samaritans.[10]And Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who he is saying to thee, Give me to drink: thou hadst asked him, and he had given thee living water.[11]The woman says to him, Lord, thou hast no vessel for drawing, and the well is deep; whence then hast thou the living water?[12]Thou art not greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and he himself drank of it, and his sons, and his young animals.[13]Jesus answered and said to her, All drinking of this water shall thirst again:[14]But whoever should drink of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a spring of water springing up to eternal life.[15]The woman says to him, Lord, give me this water, that I thirst not, nor come here to draw.[16]Jesus says to her, Retire, call thy husband, and come here.[17]The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Thou sayest well, That I have no husband:[18]For thou hadst five husbands; and now he whom thou hast is not thy husband: this thou saidst true.[19]The woman says to him, Lord, I see that thou art a prophet.[20]Our fathers worshipped in this mount; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where they must worship.[21]Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour comes, when neither in this mount, neither in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.[22]Ye worship what ye know not: we worship what we know: for salvation is of the Jews.[23]But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such worshipping him.[24]God a Spirit: and they worshipping him must worship in spirit and truth.[25]The woman says to him, I know that Messias comes, called Christ: when he should come, he will announce all things to us.[26]Jesus says to her, I am he speaking to thee.[27]And upon this his disciples came, and they wondered that he spake with the woman: yet none said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?[28]The woman then left her water buckets and departed to the city, and says to the men,[29]Come, see a man, who told me all which I ever did: is not this Christ?[30]Then went they forth out of the city, and came to him.[31]And in the mean time the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.[32]And he said to them, I have food to eat which ye know not.[33]Then said the disciples to one another, Has any one brought him to eat?[34]Jesus says to them, My food is that I might do the will of him having sent me, and finish his work.[35]Say ye not, That there is yet the fourth month, and harvest comes? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and behold the countries; for they are already white for harvest.[36]And he reaping receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life: that he sowing might rejoice together and he reaping.[37]For in this the word is true, That one is sowing, and another reaping.[38]I sent you to reap that with which ye have not been wearied: some have been wearied, and others have come into their labor.[39]And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him for the woman’s word testifying, That he told me all which I ever did.[40]When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them: and he remained there two days.[41]And many more believed on account of his word;[42]And they said to the woman, That we no more believe for thy speaking: for we ourselves have heard and know, that this is truly Christ, the Saviour of the world.[43]And after two days he came out thence, and departed to Galilee.[44]For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.[45]When therefore he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all which he did in Jerusalem in the festival: for they also came to the festival.[46]Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain royal one, whose son was sick in Capernaum.[47]He, having heard that Jesus was come from Judea to Galilee, went away to him, and asked him that he would go down and heal his son: for he was about to die.[48]Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye would not believe.[49]The royal one says to Him, Lord, go down before my child dies.[50]Jesus says to him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and he went.[51]And he already going down, his servants met him, and announced, saying, That thy child lives.[52]Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was attended to. And they said to him, That yesterday the seventh hour the fever left him.[53]Then the father knew that in that hour in which Jesus said to him, That thy son lives: and he believed, and his whole house.[54]This second sign Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.","John.5":"[1]After these was the festival of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.[2]And there is in Jerusalem, at the sheep place a pool, in Hebrew called Bethesda, having five porches.[3]In these lay a great multitude of weak, blind, lame, withered, expecting the moving of the water.[5]And a certain man was there, being in weakness thirty-eight years.[6]Jesus having seen the same lying down, and having known that it was already much time, says to him, Wilt thou be well?[7]He being sick answered him, Lord, I have no man, that, when the water was troubled, he might cast me into the pool: and in which I am coming, another steps down before me.[8]Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch, and walk.[9]And quickly the man was well, and he took up his couch, and walked: and the sabbath was in that day.[10]Then said the Jews to him healed, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to take up thy couch.[11]He answered them, He having made me well, the same said to me, Lift up thy couch, and walk.[12]Then they asked him, Who is the man having said to thee, Lift up thy couch, and walk?[13]And he healed knew not who he is: for Jesus escaped, a crowd being in the place.[14]After these, Jesus finds him in the temple, and he said to him, Behold, thou hast become well: sin no more, lest something worse be to thee.[15]The man departed, and announced to the Jews that it is Jesus having made him well.[16]And therefore the Jews drove out Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these in the sabbath.[17]And Jesus answered, My Father works till now, and I work.[18]For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, for not only did he loose the sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.[19]Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can of himself do nothing, except what he sees the Father doing: for whatever he should do, also these does the Son likewise.[20]For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all which himself does: and he will show him greater than these, that ye might wonder.[21]For as the Father arouses the dead, and makes alive; so also the Son makes alive whom he will.[22]For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son:[23]That all should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He honouring not the Son, honours not the Father having sent him.[24]Truly, truly, I say to you, That he hearing my word, and believing him having sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment; but has passed from death to life.[25]Truly, truly, I say to you, That the hour comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they hearing shall live.[26]For as the Father has life in himself, so also gave he to the Son to have life in himself;[27]And gave him authority also to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.[28]Wonder not at this: for the hour comes, in which all they in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth;[29]They having done good, to rising up of life; and they having done bad, to rising up of judgment.[30]I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of the Father having sent me.[31]If I testify of myself, my testimony is not true.[32]Another is testifying of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies of me is true.[33]Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.[34]But I receive not testimony from man: but these I say that ye might be saved.[35]He was a burning and manifest light: and ye wished to rejoice for a time in his light.[36]And I have greater testimony than of John: for the works that the Father gave me that I might finish them, the same works that I do, testify of me, that the Father has sent me.[37]And the Father having sent me, he has testified of me. Nor have ye at any time heard his voice, or seen his form.[38]And his word ye have not remaining in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.[39]Search the writings; for ye think in them to have eternal life: and these are they testifying of me.[40]And ye wish not to come to me, that ye might have life.[41]I receive not glory from man.[42]But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.[43]I have come in the name of my Father, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him will ye receive.[44]How can ye believe, receiving glory from one another, and ye seek not the glory that from God alone?[45]Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: he accusing you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.[46]For if ye had believed Moses, ye had believed me: for he himself wrote of me.[47]And if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?","John.6":"[1]After these Jesus departed beyond the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.[2]And a great crowd followed him, for they saw his signs which he did upon the sick.[3]And Jesus went up into the mount, and sat there with his disciples.[4]And the pascha was near, the festival of the Jews.[5]Then Jesus having lifted up the eyes, and seen that a great crowd comes to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these might eat?[6]And this he said trying him: for himself knew what he was about to do.[7]Philip answered him. Loaves of two hundred drachmas will not suffice them, that each of them should take some little.[8]One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him,[9]There is one little boy here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are these among so many?[10]And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. Then the men reclined, the number about five thousand.[11]And Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, distributed to his disciples, and the disciples to the reclining; and likewise of the small fishes, as many as they wished.[12]And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather the fragments remaining over, that nothing should be lost.[13]Then gathered they, and filled twelve baskets of the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over to them having eaten.[14]Then the men, having seen the sign which Jesus did, said, That this is truly the prophet coming into the world.[15]Then Jesus having known that they were about to come and carry him of forcibly, that they might make him king, departed again to the mount alone.[16]And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea.[17]And having entered into a ship, they came beyond the sea to Capernaum. And already was there darkness, and Jesus had not come to them.[18]And the sea, a great wind blowing, arose.[19]Then having urged forward about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they behold Jesus walking upon the sea, and being near the ship: and they were afraid.[20]And he says to them, I am; be not afraid.[21]Then they wished to take him into the ship: and the ship was quickly at land to which they retired.[22]The morrow, the crowd standing beyond the sea having seen that no other small vessel was there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the small vessel, but his disciples departed alone;[23](But also other small vessels came out of Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, the Lord having returned thanks:)[24]When the crowd therefore saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.[25]And having found them beyond the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou here?[26]Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but for that ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.[27]Work not for food perishing, but food remaining to eternal life, which the Son of man will give you: for him God the Father sealed.[28]Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?[29]Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe in him whom he has sent.[30]Then said they to him, What sign doest thou, that we might see, and believe thee? what workest thou?[31]Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.[32]Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you bread from heaven; but my Father gives you true bread from heaven.[33]For the bread of God is he coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.[34]Then said they to him, Lord, always give us this bread.[35]And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he coming to me should not hunger; and he believing in me should not thirst.[36]But I said to you, That ye have seen me, and believe not.[37]All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and he coming to me I will not cast out.[38]For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do my will, but the will of him having sent me.[39]And this is the will of the Father having sent me, that all which he has given me, I should not loose of it, but raise it up in the last day.[40]And this is the will of him having sent me, that every one seeing the Son, and believing in him, should have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.[41]Then murmured the Jews about him, because he said, I am the bread having come down from heaven.[42]And they said, Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son, whose father and mother we know? how then says he, That I have come down from heaven?[43]Then answered Jesus and said to them, Murmur not with one another.[44]None can come to me, except the Father having sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.[45]It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one therefore having heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.[46]Not that any one has seen the Father, except he being from God, he has seen the Father.[47]Truly, truly, I say to you, he believing in me has eternal life.[48]I am the bread of life.[49]Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and died.[50]This is the bread which coming down from heaven, that whoever should eat of it, and he should not die.[51]I am the living bread which having come down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and also the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.[52]Then the Jews contended with one another, saying, How can he give us the flesh to eat.[53]Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.[54]He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.[55]For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.[56]He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, remains in me, and I in him.[57]As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father: also he chewing me, the same also shall live through me.[58]This is the bread which having come down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he chewing this bread shall live forever.[59]He said these, teaching in the synagogue, in Capernaum.[60]Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, This is a hard word; who can hear it.[61]And Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmur for this, said to them, Does this offend you?[62]If then ye see the Son of man going up where he was before.[63]It is the spirit making alive; the flesh profits nothing: the words which I speak to you are spirit, and are life.[64]But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they are not believing, and who he is going to deliver him up.[65]And he said, Therefore have I said to you, that no one can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.[66]From this many of his disciples went away back, and walked no more with him.[67]Then said Jesus to the twelve, And ye will not go away?[68]Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life.[69]And we have believed, and known, that thou art Christ, Son of the living God.[70]Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and of you one is a devil?[71]And he spake of Judas Iscariot, of Simon: for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.","John.7":"[1]And Jesus walked after these in Galilee: for he wished not to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.[2]And the festival of the Jews was near, the Pitching of tents.[3]Then said his brethren to him, Go away thence, and retire to Judea, that also thy disciples might see thy works which thou doest.[4]For none does any thing in secret, and seeks himself to be in freedom of speech. If thou do these, make thyself manifest to the world.[5]For neither believed his brethren in him.[6]Then says Jesus to them, My time is not yet present: and your time is always ready.[7]The world cannot hate you: but me it hates, for I testify of it, that its works are evil.[8]Go ye up to this festival: I go not yet up to the festival; for my time has not yet been completed.[9]And speaking to them these things, he remained in Galilee.[10]And when his brethren went up, then he went up to the festival, not openly, but as in secret.[11]Then the Jews sought him in the festival, and said, Where is he.[12]And much murmuring was for him in the crowds: some truly said, That he is good: and others said, No; but he deceives the crowd.[13]However none spake of him with freedom of speech, for fear of the Jews.[14]And now the festival being in the midst, Jesus went up to the temple, and taught.[15]And the Jews wondered, saying, How knows he letters, not having learned.[16]Jesus answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his having sent me.[17]If any desire to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak from myself.[18]He speaking from himself, seeks his own glory: but he seeking the glory of him having sent him, he is true, and no injustice is in him.[19]Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you does the law? Why seek ye to kill me?[20]The crowd answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?[21]Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel for this.[22]Moses has given you circumcision; (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and in the sabbath ye circumcise a man.[23]If a man receive circumcision in the sabbath, that the law of Moses be not loosed; rage not at me, because I made a man wholly well on the Sabbath.[24]Judge not according to sight, but judge just judgment.[25]Then said some of the Jerusalemites, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?[26]And, behold, he speaks in freedom of speech, and they say nothing to him. Not at any time knew the rulers truly, that this is truly Christ?[27]But we know this whence he is: and Christ, when he should come, none knows whence he is.[28]Then cried Jesus in the temple, teaching, and saying, And ye know me, and ye know whence I am: and I have not come of myself, but he having sent me is true, whom ye know not.[29]But I know him; for I am from him, and he sent me.[30]Then sought they to seize him: and none put the hand upon him, for his hour had not yet come.[31]And many of the crowd believed on him, and said, That Christ, when he should come, will he do more signs than these which he did?[32]The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things of him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent servants that they might seize him.[33]Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time am I with you, and I retire to him having sent me.[34]And ye shall seek me and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come.[35]Then said the Jews among themselves, Where is he about to go, that we shall not find him? is he not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?[36]What is the word which he spake, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come?[37]In the last day, the great one of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any thirst, let him come to me, and drink.[38]He believing in me, as said the writing, from his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.[39](This spake he of the Spirit which they believing in him were about to receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet; for Jesus was not yet honoured.)[40]Then many of the crowd, having heard the word, said, This is truly a prophet.[41]Others said, This is Christ: and others said, Yet Christ comes not out of Galilee.[42]Said not the writing, That of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was, Christ comes?[43]Then was there a division in the crowd on his account.[44]And some of them wished to seize him; but none put hands upon him.[45]Then came the servants to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why did ye not bring him.[46]And the servants answered, Never spake man as this man.[47]Then the Pharisees answered them, Have ye not also been deceived.[48]Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?[49]But the crowd, not knowing the law, are cursed.[50]Nicodemus says to them, (he having come to him by night, being one of them,)[51]Our law judges not a man, except it first hear from him, and know what he does.[52]They answered and said to him, And art thou not of Galilee? Search, and see: for a prophet has not risen out of Galilee.[53]And each man went to his house.","John.8":"[1]And Jesus went to the mount of Olives.[2]And again in the morning he was present in the temple, and all the people came to him; and having sat down, he taught them.[3]And the scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,[4]They say to him, Teacher, this woman was taken committing adultery, in the very act.[5]In the law Moses commanded us such to be stoned: therefore what sayest thou?[6]And this said they, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his fingers upon the earth.[7]And when they continued asking him, having lifted up the head, he said to them, Let him faultless among you, first cast a stone at her.[8]And again having stooped down, he wrote upon the earth.[9]And they having heard, and being convicted by consciousness, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest even to the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.[10]And Jesus having lifted up the head, and seen none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are they accusing thee? has none condemned thee.[11]And she said, None, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.[12]Again therefore Jesus spake to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he following me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.[13]Then said the Pharisees to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not true.[14]Jesus answered and said to them. Though I testify of myself; my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and where I retire; but ye know not whence I came and where I retire.[15]Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.[16]And if I also judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father having sent me.[17]And also in your law has it been written, that the testimony of two men is true.[18]I am he testifying of myself, and the Father having sent me testifies of me.[19]Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye had known my Father also.[20]These words spake Jesus in the royal treasury, teaching in the temple: and no one seized him; for his hour had not yet come.[21]Then said Jesus again to them, I retire, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I retire, ye cannot come.[22]Then said the Jews, Will he not kill himself? for he says, Where I retire, ye cannot come.[23]And he said to them, Ye are from below I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.[24]I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.[25]Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, In the beginning, he which I spake to you.[26]Many things have I to speak and judge of you; but he having sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him these say I to the world.[27]They knew not that he spake to them of the Father.[28]Then said Jesus to them, When ye lift up the Son of man then shall ye know that I am, and I do nothing of myself; but as my Father taught me, these I speak.[29]And he having sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always things pleasing to him.[30]He speaking these, many believed in him.[31]Then said Jesus to the Jews having believed him, If ye remain in my word, ye are truly my disciples.[32]And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.[33]They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never served any; how sayest thou, That ye shall be free?[34]Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, say I to you, That every one doing sin, is servant of sin.[35]And the servant remains not in the house forever; the Son remains forever.[36]If the Son make you free, ye shall be truly free.[37]I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, for my word has no place in you.[38]I, what I have seen from my Father, speak: and ye, therefore, what ye have seen of your Father, do.[39]They answered and said to him, Abraham is our Father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye had done Abraham’s works.[40]And now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.[41]Ye do the works of your father. Then said they to him, We have not been born of fornication; for we have one Father, God.[42]Then said Jesus to them, If God were your Father, ye had loved me: for I went forth from God, and came; for I have not come of myself, but he sent me.[43]Wherefore ye know not my speech, for ye cannot hear my word.[44]Ye are of your father the devil, and the eager desires of your father will ye do. He was slaying men from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he would speak a lie, he speaks of his own things; for he is a liar, and the father of him.[45]And because I say the truth, ye believe me not.[46]Which of you convicts me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me.[47]He being of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear not, for ye are not of God.[48]Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?[49]Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.[50]And I seek not my glory: there is he seeking and judging.[51]Truly, truly, I say to you, If any keep my word, he should never see death.[52]Then said the Jews to him, Now we have known that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any keep my word, he shall never taste of death.[53]Thou art not greater than our father Abraham, who died; and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?[54]Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father honouring me; whom ye say, that he is your God:[55]And ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his word.[56]Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he might see my day: and he saw, and rejoiced.[57]Then said the Jews to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham.[58]And Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was born, I am.[59]Then lifted up they stones that they might cast upon him: and Jesus was hid, and he went forth out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and so he passed by.","John.9":"[1]And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.[2]And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, he, or his parents, that he was born blind?[3]Jesus answered, Neither did this sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.[4]I must work the works of him having sent me, while it is day: night comes, when none can work.[5]While I be in the world, I am the light of the world.[6]Having said these, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay upon the eyes of the blind,[7]And said to him, Retire, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.[8]Then the neighbors, and those seeing him before that he was blind, said, Is not this he sitting and begging?[9]Others said, This is he: and others, That he is like him: he said, That I am.[10]Then said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?[11]He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Retire to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw again.[12]Then said they to him, Where is he? He says I know not.[13]They bring him to the Pharisees, him once blind.[14]And it was the sabbath, when Jesus made clay, and opened his eyes.[15]Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he saw again. He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.[16]Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man do such signs? And a division was among them.[17]They say to the blind again, What sayest thou of him, for he opened thine eyes? He said, That he is a prophet.[18]Then the Jews believed not of him that he was blind, and saw again, until they called the parents of him having looked up.[19]And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that be was born blind how then does be now see.[20]His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:[21]But how he now sees, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: he has age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.[22]These said his parents, for they feared the Jews: for already had the Jews agreed, that if any should acknowledge him Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.[23]Therefore said his parents, That he has age; ask him.[24]Then called they the man of a second time, who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.[25]He answered and said, If he be sinful, I know not: one thing I know, that, being blind, now I see.[26]And again said they to him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?[27]He answered them, I told you already, and ye heard not: why wish ye to hear again? ye wish not also to be his disciples?[28]Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.[29]We know that God has spoken to Moses; but this, we know not whence he is.[30]The man answered and said to them, For in this is it wonderful, that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes.[31]And we know that God hears not the sinful: but if any be godly, and do his will, this he hears.[32]From forever was it not heard that any opened the eyes of him born blind.[33]If this one were not of God, he could do nothing.[34]They answered and said to him, In sins wert thou wholly born, and teachest thou us? And they cast him without.[35]Jesus heard that they cast him without; and having found him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?[36]He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?[37]And Jesus said to him, Thou hast also seen him, and he speaking with thee, the same is he.[38]And he said I believe, Lord. And he worshipped him.[39]And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they not seeing might see; and they seeing might be blind.[40]And they being with him of the Pharisees heard these things, and said to him,[41]We are not also blind? Jesus said to them If ye were blind, ye had not sinned: and now ye say, That we see; therefore your sin remains.","John.10":"[1]Truly, truly, I say to you, He not coming in through the door into the court-yard of the sheep, but coming up from another place, he is a thief and robber.[2]And he coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.[3]To him the guard of the door opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.[4]And when he would put forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.[5]And a stranger they would not follow, but they will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.[6]This proverb spake Jesus to then: and they knew not what things they were which he spake to them.[7]Then said Jesus again to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, That I am the door of the sheep.[8]All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep heard them not.[9]I am the door: if any come in through me, he shall be saved, and he shall me in, and go out, and find pasture.[10]The thief comes not, except that he steal, and sacrifice, and destroy: I came that they might have life, and have above measure.[11]I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.[12]But the hired one, and not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and he leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf plunders them, and scatters the sheep.[13]The hired flees, because he is hired, and no care is to him for the sheep.[14]I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and am known by mine.[15]As the Father knows me, I also know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.[16]And I have, other sheep, which are not of this court-yard: and I must also bring them, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.[17]Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.[18]No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command received I of my Father.[19]Then was a division again among the Jews for these words.[20]And many of them said, He has a demon, and is frenzied; why hear ye him?[21]Others said, These are not the words of a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind.[22]And there was the festival of inauguration among the Jerusalemites, and it was winter.[23]And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.[24]Then the Jews surrounded him, and said to him, How long takest thou away our soul? If thou art Christ, say to us with freedom of speech.[25]Jesus answered them, I said to you, and ye believe not: the works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.[26]But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.[27]My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.[28]And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.[29]My Father, who has given to me, is greater than all; and no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.[30]I and my Father are one.[31]Then again lifted up the Jews stones that they might stone him.[32]Jesus Answered them, Many good works I shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do ye stone me.[33]The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being man, makest thyself God.[34]Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said; Ye are gods?[35]If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the writing cannot be loosed;[36]Whom the Father consecrated, and sent into the world, say ye that thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God.[37]If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.[38]And if I do, though ye believe me not, believe the works: that ye might know, and believe, that the Father in me, and I in him.[39]Then sought they again to take him: and he went out from their hand,[40]And again he departed beyond Jordan to the place where John was first immersing; and he remained there.[41]And many came to him, and said, That truly John did no sign: but all which John said of him was true.[42]And many believed in him there.","John.11":"[1]And a certain Lazarus was sick, from Bethany, of the town of Mary And Martha her sister.[2]It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.[3]Then sent the sisters to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.[4]And Jesus having heard, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God be honoured.[5]And Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.[6]When therefore he heard that he is sick, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days.[7]Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.[8]The disciples say to him, Rabbi, now the Jews sought to stone thee; and retirest thou there again?[9]Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If any walk in the day, he stumbles not, for he sees the light of this world.[10]But if any walk in the night, he stumbles, for light is not in him.[11]These things said he: and after this he says to them, Lazarus our friend has been set to sleep; but I go, that I might waken him.[12]Then said his disciples, Lord, if he has been set to sleep, he shall be saved.[13]And Jesus spake of his death: but these supposed that he speaks of the repose of sleep.[14]Then therefore Jesus said to them with freedom of speech, Lazarus is dead.[15]And I rejoice for you, that ye might believe, that I was not there; but let us go to him.[16]Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we might die with him.[17]Then Jesus, having come, found him having four days already in the tomb.[18]And Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia.[19]And many of the Jews were come to them about Martha and Many, that they might console them for their brother.[20]Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus comes, met him: and Mary sat in the house.[21]Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.[22]But now I also know, that whatever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.[23]Jesus says to her, Thy brother shall arise.[24]Martha says to him, I know that he shall rise at the rising up in the last day.[25]Jesus said to her, I am the rising up, and life: he believing in me, though he die, shall live.[26]And all living and believing in me should never die. Believest thou this?[27]She says to him, Yes, Lord: I have believed that thou art Christ, the Son of God, he coming into the world.[28]And having said these, she departed and called Mary her sister secretly, having said, The Teacher is come, and calls thee.[29]She, when she heard, arises quickly, and comes to him.[30]And Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met him.[31]Then the Jews being in the house with her, and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose quickly and went forth, followed her, saying, That she retires to the tomb, that she might weep there.[32]Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou wert here, my brother had not died.[33]Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping having come with her, was heavy in spirit, and troubled himself,[34]And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.[35]Jesus wept.[36]Then said the Jews, See how he loved him![37]And certain of them said, Could not he having opened the eyes of the blind, have made that this should not die?[38]Then Jesus again being heavy in himself, comes to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was laid upon it.[39]Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he already smells: for it is the fourth day.[40]Jesus says to her, Said I not to thee, if thou shouldest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God.[41]Then took they away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above, and said, Father, I return thee thanks that thou didst hear me.[42]And I knew that thou always hearest me: but for the crowd standing round I said, that they might believe that thou didst send me.[43]And having said these, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.[44]And the dead came out, bound feet and hands with bandages; and his face was bound with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him retire.[45]Then many of the Jews, having come to Mary, and seeing what Jesus did, believed in him.[46]But certain of them departed to the Pharisees, and said to them what Jesus did.[47]Then gathered together the chief priests and Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.[48]If we let him thus go, all will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away also our place and nation.[49]And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing,[50]Neither turn ye in your thoughts that it is profitable to us, that one man die for the people, and the nation perish not.[51]And this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;[52]And not for the nation alone, but that also the children of God, scattered, should be gathered into one.[53]Then from that day they counselled together that they might kill him.[54]Jesus then walked no more with freedom of speech among the Jews; but departed thence to the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.[55]And the Jews’ pascha was near: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the pascha, that they might purify themselves.[56]Then sought they Jesus, and said with one another, standing in the temple, What seems it to you, that he should not come to the festival.[57]And also the chief priests and Pharisees had given a command, that if any know where he is, he should make known, that they might take him.","John.12":"[1]Then Jesus, six days before the pascha, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus the dead, whom he raised from the dead.[2]Then made they him a supper there, and Martha served; and Lazarus was one of them reclining at table with him.[3]Then Mary having taken a pound of perfumed oil of spikenard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hairs: and the house was filled with the smell of the perfumed oil.[4]Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, of Simon, being about to deliver him up,[5]Wherefore was not this perfumed oil sold for three hundred drachmas, and given to the poor?[6]And this he said, not that care was to him for the poor: but because he was a thief, and had the small coffer, and carried things deposited.[7]Then said Jesus, Let her go; for the day of my interment has she kept this.[8]For the poor have ye always with you; and me ye have not always.[9]Then a great crowd of Jews knew that he is there: and they came not for Jesus alone, but that also they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.[10]And the chief priests took counsel that they might also kill Lazarus;[11]Because many for him retired, and believed in Jesus.[12]The morrow a great crowd, having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus comes to Jerusalem,[13]Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to the meeting to him, and cried, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord, King of Israel.[14]And Jesus having found a small ass, sat upon it; as it is written,[15]Fear not, O daughter of Sion: behold, thy King comes, sitting upon the foal of an ass.[16]And these the disciples knew not at first: but when Jesus was honoured, then remembered they that these were written of him, and they did these things to him.[17]The crowd therefore testified which being with him, that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.[18]And for this the crowd met him, for they heard he had done this sign.[19]Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Ye see that ye aid nothing; behold, the world has departed after him.[20]And there were certain Greeks of those going up that they might worship in the festival:[21]These then came to Philip, him of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus.[22]Philip comes and says to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip say to Jesus.[23]And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be honoured.[24]Truly, truly, I say to you, except a kernel of wheat, having fallen into the earth, should die, it remains alone: and if it should die, it brings forth much fruit.[25]He loving his soul shall lose it; but he hating his soul in this world, shall guard it for life eternal.[26]If any one would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant: and if any one serve me, him will the Father honour.[27]Now has my soul been troubled; and what should I say? O Father, save me from this hour: but for this came I to this hour.[28]Father, honour thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, I have also honoured, and will again honour.[29]Then the crowd, having stood and heard, said it was thunder: others said, A messenger has spoken to him.[30]Jesus answered and said, This voice has not been for me, but for you.[31]Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.[32]And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all to myself.[33]This said he, signifying what death he was about to die.[34]The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ remains forever: and how sayest thou That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?[35]Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have light, lest darkness overtake you: and he walking in darkness knows not where he retires.[36]While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye might be the sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and having departed, he was hid from them.[37]And he having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:[38]That the word of Esaias the prophet might be completed, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?[39]Therefore they could not believe, for Esaias said again,[40]He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart: lest they see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and should turn back, and I should heal them.[41]These said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.[42]Yet nevertheless also many of the rulers believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge, lest they should be excluded from the synagogue:[43]For they loved the honour of men more than the honour of God.[44]Jesus cried and said, He believing in me, believes not in me, but in him having sent me.[45]And he seeing me, sees him having sent me.[46]I have come a light into the world, that every one believing in me should not remain in darkness.[47]And if any hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.[48]He rejecting me, and not receiving my words, has him judging him: the word which I spake, that shall judge him in the last day.[49]For I spake not of myself; but the Father having sent me, he gave me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.[50]And I know that his command is life eternal: therefore what I speak, as the Father said to me, so I speak.","John.13":"[1]And before the feast of the pascha, Jesus knowing that his hour had come that he should pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.[2]And supper having been, the devil having already cast into the heart of Judas Iscariot, of Simon, that he should deliver him up;[3]Jesus knowing that the Father has given all things to him into the hands, and that he came out from God, and retired to God;[4]He arises from supper, and lays down the garments; and having taken a linen cloth, he girded himself.[5]Then casts he water into a washing vessel, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe with the linen cloth with which he was girded.[6]And he comes to Simon Peter: and he says to him, Lord, washest thou my feet?[7]Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know after these.[8]Peter says to him, Thou shouldest never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.[9]Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but the hands and head.[10]Jesus says to him, He washed has no need but to have the feet washed, but is wholly clean: and ye are clean, but not all.[11]For he knew him delivering him up, therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.[12]When therefore he washed their feet; and took his garments, going to recline again, he said to them, Knew ye what I have done to you?[13]Ye call one Teacher and Lord: and ye say well; for I am.[14]If therefore, I washed your feet, the Lord and Teacher; ye also ought to wash the feet of one another:[15]For I have given you a pattern, as I have done to you, also should ye do.[16]Truly, truly I say to you, The servant is not greater than his Lord; neither the sent greater than he having sent him.[17]If ye know these, happy are ye if ye do them.[18]I say not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the writing might be completed, He chewing bread with me lifted up his heel against me.[19]From now I say to you, before it shall be, that, when it should be, ye might believe that I am.[20]Truly, truly, I say to you, He receiving whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he receiving me receives him having sent me.[21]These things Jesus having spoken, was troubled in spirit, and he testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.[22]Then looked the disciples one upon another, being perplexed of whom he spake.[23]And there was one of his disciples reclining on the bosom of Jesus, whom he loved.[24]Then Simon Peter nodded to this one, to inquire who it might be of whom he speaks.[25]And he reclining upon Jesus’ breast says to him, Lord, who is it?[26]Jesus answers, This is he to whom I, having dipped a small morsel, shall bestow. And having dipped the small morsel, he gives to Judas Iscariot, of Simon.[27]And after the small morsel then came Satan into him. Then says Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly.[28]And this none of the reclining knew for what he said to him.[29]For some thought, since Judas had the small coffer, that Jesus says to him, Purchase of what we have need for the festival; or, that he might give something to the poor.[30]He having taken the small morsel went quickly forth: and it was night when he then went forth.[31]Jesus says, Now was the Son of man honoured, and God was honoured in him.[32]If God were honoured in him, also shall God honour him in himself, and quickly shall he honour him.[33]Little children, yet a little am I with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, That where I retire, ye cannot come; and I say to you now.[34]A new command give I to you, That ye love one another: as I loved you, that ye also love one another.[35]In this all shall know that ye are disciples to me, if ye have love in one another.[36]Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where retirest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I retire, thou shalt not be able to follow me now; and afterwards thou shalt follow me.[37]Peter says to him, Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.[38]Jesus answered, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me Truly, truly, I say to thee, The cock shall not utter a sound, till thou deny me thrice.","John.14":"[1]Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, and believe in me.[2]In my Father’s house are many dwellings: and if not, I had said to you. I go to prepare a place for you.[3]And if I go and prepare a place for you, again I come, and I will receive you to myself; that where I am, ye might be also.[4]And where I retire ye know, and the way ye know.[5]Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou retirest; and how can we know the way?[6]Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, except by me.[7]If ye had known me, ye had also known my Father: and from now ye know, and have seen him.[8]Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us.[9]Jesus says, to him, So long time am I with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? he having seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?[10]Believest thou not that I in the Father, and the Father is in me? the words which I speak to you, I speak not of myself: and the Father remaining in me does the works.[11]Believe ye me that I in the Father, and the Father in me: and if not, for these works believe me.[12]Truly, truly, I say to you, He believing in me, the works which I do shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do; for I go to my Father.[13]And whatever ye ask in my name, this will I do, that the Father might be honoured by the Son.[14]If ye ask anything in my name, I will do.[15]If ye love me, keep my commands.[16]And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Intercessor, that should remain with you forever;[17]The Spirit of truth; which the world cannot receive, for it sees it not, neither knows: and ye know it; for it shall remain with you, and shall be in you.[18]I will not leave you orphans; I come to you.[19]Yet a little, and the world sees me no more; and ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.[20]In that day shall ye know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.[21]He having my commands, and keeping them, the same is he loving me: and he loving me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.[22]Judas says to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how has it been that thou art about to make thyself manifest to us, and not to the world?[23]Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make our stay with him.[24]He not loving me will not keep my words: and the word which ye hear is not of me, but of the Father having sent me.[25]These have I spoken to you, remaining with you.[26]But the Intercessor, the Holy Spirit, which the Father will send in my name, the same shall teach you all things, and he shall remind you of all things which I spake to you.[27]Peace I leave to you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be timid.[28]Ye have heard that I said to you, I retire, and I am coming to you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.[29]And now have I told you before it shall be, that when it should be, ye might believe.[30]I will no more speak much with you: for the ruler of this world comes, and has nothing in me.[31]But that the world might know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do.

O holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou but given me, that they might be one, as we.[12]When I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those thou hast given me I watched, and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the writing might be completed.[13]And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that I might have my joy completed in them.[14]I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, for they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.[15]I ask not that thou take them out of the world, but that thou keep them from the evil.[16]They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.[17]Render them holy in thy truth: thy word is truth.[18]As thou sentest me into the world, I also sent them into the world.[19]And for them I render myself holy, that they also be rendered holy in the truth;[20]And I ask not for these alone, but also for them believing in me through their word;[21]That all might be one; as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, that they also be one in us; that the world might believe that thou sentest me.[22]And I, the honour which thou hast given me, have given them; that they might be one, as we are one.[23]I in them, and thou in me, that they might be perfected in one: and that the world might know that thou sentest me, and lovedst them, as thou lovedst me.[24]O Father, those thou hast given me, I will that where I am these also be with me: that they might behold my glory, which thou gavest me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.[25]O just Father, the world knew thee not: but I knew thee, and these knew that thou didst send me.[26]And I made known to them thy name, and I will make known: that the love with which thou lovedst me might be in them, and I in them.","John.18":"[1]Jesus having said these, went out with his disciples beyond the torrent Kedron, where was a garden, into which he came, he and his disciples.[2]And Judas also knew the place, he delivering him up: for Jesus was many times gathered there with his disciples.[3]Then Judas, having taken a band and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lights and torches and weapons.[4]Jesus then, knowing all coming upon him, having come out, said to them, Whom seek ye.[5]They answered him, Jesus the Nazarite. Jesus says to them, I am. And Judas also, he delivering up, was standing with them.[6]Then, when he said to them, That I am, they went away backward, and fell to the ground.[7]Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazarite.[8]Jesus answered, I said to you, that I am: if then ye seek me, leave these to retire:[9]That the word might be completed which he spake, That whom thou hast given me, I lost none of them.[10]Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and struck the chief priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. And the name to the servant was Malchus.[11]Then said Jesus to Peter, Put thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it.[12]Then the band and captain of a thousand and attendants of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,[13]And led him away to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the chief priest that year.[14]Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.[15]And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple: and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and came together with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest.[16]And Peter stood before the door without. Then went out the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and spake to her guarding the door, and brought in Peter.[17]Then says the young girl guarding the door to Peter, Art not thou also of this man’s disciples? He says, I am not.[18]And the servants and attendants stood, having made a heap of burning coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.[19]Then the chief priest asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.[20]Jesus answered him, I spake with freedom of speech to the world: I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews were always come together; and I spake nothing in secret.[21]Why askest thou me? ask those having heard, what I said to them: see, they know what I said.[22]And he having said these things, one of the attendants standing by gave Jesus a blow with a rod, having said, Answerest thou the chief priest so?[23]Jesus answered him, If I spake badly, testify of evil: and if well, why strikest thou me?[24](Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.)[25]And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself. Then said they to him, Art thou not also of his disciples he denied, and said, I am not.[26]Says one of the chief priest’s servants, being of his family whose ear Peter cut off, Saw I not thee in the garden with him?[27]Then Peter again denied: and quickly the cock uttered a sound.[28]Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the pretorium: and it was early morning; and they came not into the pretorium, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the pascha.[29]Then went Pilate out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man.[30]They answered and said to him, If he were not injurious, we had not delivered him to thee.[31]Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. Then said the Jews to him, It is not lawful for us to kill any one:[32]That the word of Jesus might be completed which he spake, giving a sign by what death he was about to die.[33]Then came Pilate again into the pretorium, and asked Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews?[34]Jesus answered him, of thyself sayest thou this, or did others tell thee of me?[35]Pilate answered, Much less am I a Jew; thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: What didst thou?[36]Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had contended, that I be not delivered to the Jews; and now my kingdom is not hence.[37]Then said Pilate to him, Art thou not then king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I testify to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.[38]Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, again went he out to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault in him.[39]But a custom is to you, that I loose one to you in the pascha: will ye therefore I should loose to you the King of the Jews.[40]Then cried they all again, saying, Not this, but Barabbas: and Barabbas was a robber.","John.19":"[1]Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.[2]And the soldiers having twined a crown of thorns, put upon his head, and they put round him a purple robe,[3]And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave him blows with a rod.[4]Then again went out Pilate without, and says to them, See, I lead him to you without, that ye might know that in him I find no fault.[5]Then went forth Jesus without, bearing a crown of thorns, and a purple garment. And he says to them, Behold the man![6]When therefore the chief priests and attendants saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify. Pilate says to them, Take ye him, and crucify; for I find no fault in him.[7]The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, for he made himself the Son of God.[8]When Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid:[9]And went into the pretorium again, and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.[10]Then says Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to loose thee.[11]Jesus answered, Thou hast no power against me, if it were not given thee from above: therefore he delivering me to thee has greater sin.[12]From this Pilate sought to loose him: and the Jews cried out, saying, If thou loose this, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.[13]Then Pilate having heard, brought Jesus without, and sat upon the judgment seat, in a place called Paved with ornamental stones; in Hebraic, Gabbatha.[14]And it was the preparation of the pascha, and about the sixth hour: and he says to the Jews, Behold your King![15]And they cried, Take away, take away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.[16]Then, therefore, delivered he him to them, that he might be crucified.[17]And they took Jesus, and led away: and bearing his cross he went out into a place called Kranium, which in Hebraic is called Golgotha:[18]Where they crucified him, and with him two others, hence and thence, and Jesus in the midst.[19]And Pilate also wrote a title, and put upon the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARITE, KING OF THE JEWS.[20]Then read many of the Jews this title: for the place was near the city where Jesus was crucified: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Roman.[21]Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.[22]Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.[23]Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part: and also the coat: and the coat was unsewn through the whole, having been woven from above.[24]Then said they to one another, Let us not divide it, but let us draw lots for it, whose it shall be: that the writing might be completed, saying, They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my clothing cast they the lot. Then truly did the soldiers these things.[25]And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.[26]Jesus then having seen the mother, and the disciple standing near, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son![27]Then says he to the disciple, Behold thy mother And from that hour the disciple took her to his own.[28]After this, Jesus knowing that all things were already completed, that the writing might be finished, says, I thirst.[29]Then was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, put upon hyssop, and brought near to his mouth.[30]When Jesus therefore took the vinegar, he said, It has been finished: and having bent the head, he delivered up the spirit.[31]Then the Jews, that the bodies remain not upon the cross in the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for great was the day of that sabbath,) asked Pilate that their legs be broken, and they be taken away.[32]Then came the soldiers, and truly brake the legs of the first, and of the other crucified with him.[33]And upon having come to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they brake not his legs:[34]But one of the soldiers with a javelin pricked his side, and quickly came out blood and water.[35]And he having seen has testified, and his testimony is true: and he knows that he says true, that ye might believe.[36]For these were that the writing be completed, A bone of him shall not be broken.[37]And again another writing says, They shall look on whom they goaded.[38]And after these, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, in secret, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might takeaway the body of Jesus: and Pilate conceded. He came then, and took the body of Jesus.[39]And Nicodemus also came, he having come to Jesus at first by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds.[40]Then took they the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen bandages with spices, as the custom is to the Jews to prepare a body for interment.[41]And in the place where he was crucified, was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was ever laid.[42]There, therefore, on account of the Jews’ preparation, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.","John.20":"[1]And in one of the sabbaths comes Mary Magdalene in the morning, there yet being darkness, to the tomb, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb.[2]Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They took away the Lord from the tomb; and we know not where they laid him.[3]Peter then came forth, and the other disciple, and they came to the tomb.[4]And they two ran together: and the other disciple ran before, swifter than Peter, and came first to the tomb.[5]And having stood stooping, he sees the linen bandages lying; yet he did not go in.[6]Then comes Simon Peter following him, and he came into the tomb, and sees the linen bandages lying,[7]And the napkin, which was upon his head, not lying with the linen bandages, but separately inwrapped in one place.[8]Then, therefore, went in also the other disciple, having first come to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.[9]For not yet knew they the writing, that he must rise from the dead.[10]Then went away the disciples again by themselves.[11]And Mary stood near the tomb weeping without: therefore as she wept, she stood stooping into the tomb,[12]And sees two messengers in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was laid.[13]And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She says to them, Because they took away my Lord, and I know not where they laid him.[14]And having said these, she was turned back, and sees Jesus standing, and she knew not that it is Jesus.[15]Jesus says to her, Woman, why weepest thou a whom seekest thou? She, thinking that it is the gardener, says to him, Lord, if thou didst bear him away, say where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.[16]Jesus says to her, Mary, She having turned, says to him, Rabboni; which is called, Teacher.[17]Jesus says to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: and go thou to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.[18]Mary Magdalene comes announcing to the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and he said these to her.[19]Then it being evening, in that one day of the sabbaths, and the doors shut where the disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace to you.[20]And having said this, he showed them his hands, and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.[21]Then said Jesus again to them, Peace to you: as the Father has sent me, I also send you.[22]And having said this, he inspired, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit:[23]Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them: whose soever ye retain, they have been retained.[24]And Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.[25]Then said the other disciples to him, We have seen the Lord. And he said to them, Except I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.[26]And after eight days again were his disciples within, and Thomas with them: Jesus comes, the doors shut, and said, Peace to you.[27]Then says he to Thomas, Bring hither thy finger, and see my hands; and bring thy hand, and put into my side: and be not unbelieving, but believing.[28]And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.[29]Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: happy they not having seen, and having believed.[30]Then truly many other signs did Jesus also before his disciples, which are not written in this small book:[31]But these have been written, that ye might believe that Jesus is Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life in his name.","John.21":"[1]After these things Jesus again manifested himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and so he made manifest.[2]There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and they of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.[3]Simon Peter says to them, I retire to fish. They say to him, We also go with thee. They came forth, and went up into the ship quickly; and in that night they caught nothing.[4]And morning being already come, Jesus stood on the sea-shore: yet the disciples knew not that it is Jesus.[5]Then says Jesus to them, Children, have ye nothing cooked to eat? They answered him, No.[6]And he said to them, Cast the net to the right parts of the ship, and ye shall find. Therefore they cast, and were no more able to draw it, from the multitude of fishes.[7]Then that disciple says, whom Jesus loved, to Peter, It is the Lord. Then Simon Peter having heard that it is the Lord, girded round the upper garment, (for he was naked,) and cast himself into the sea.[8]And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as from two hundred cubits) dragging the net of fishes.[9]When therefore they came away to the land, they see a heap of burning coals laid, and little fish laid upon, and bread.[10]Jesus says to them, Bring ye from the little fishes which ye have now caught.[11]Simon Peter went up, and drew the net upon the earth, full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty-three: and being so many, the net was not split.[12]And Jesus says to them, Come, dine. And none of the disciples dared to inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it is the Lord.[13]Then comes Jesus, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.[14]This already the third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples, having risen from the dead.[15]Then, when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.[16]Jesus says to him again the second time, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my sheep.[17]He says to him the third time, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved that he said the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.[18]Truly, truly, I say to thee, when thou west younger, thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest; and when thou shalt grow old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou wilt not.[19]And this he said, signifying by what death he shall honour God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.[20]And Peter having turned back, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined in the supper upon his breast, and said, Lord, who is he delivering thee up.[21]Peter having seen him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what this.[22]Jesus says to him, If I will him to remain till I come, what to thee? follow me.[23]Then went out the word to the brethren, That this disciple dies not: and Jesus said not to him, That he dies not; but, If I will him to remain till I come, what to thee?[24]This is the disciple testifying of these, and having written this: and we know that his testimony is true.[25]And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they be written every one, neither do I suppose the world itself will receive the books written. Amen.","Acts.1":"[1]Truly the first word had I made of all things, O Theophilus, of which Jesus began to do and also to teach,[2]Till the day having commanded the sent whom he chose through the Holy Spirit, he was taken up:[3]To them also he presented himself living, after he suffered, by many infallible signs, through forty days seen to them, and speaking the things of the kingdom of God:[4]And, being collected together, he enjoined them not to be separated from Jerusalem, but to wait for the solemn promise of the Father, which ye heard of me.[5]For John truly immersed in water; and ye shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit not after these many days.[6]Truly they therefore having come together, asked him, saying, Lord, if in this time thou wilt restore the kingdom of Israel?[7]And he said to them, It is not yours to know the times and occasions, which the Father fixed in his own power.[8]But ye shall receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses to me also in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the last of the earth.[9]And having said these, they beholding, he was lifted up; and a cloud received him from their eyes.[10]And as they were looking intently to heaven, he going, behold, two men were standing before them in white raiment;[11]And they said, Galilean men, why stand ye looking to heaven this Jesus, taken up from you to heaven, so shall he come which manner ye saw him going to heaven.[12]Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olive, which is near Jerusalem, having the way of a sabbath.[13]And when they came in, they went up into an upper room, where were remaining also Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas of James.[14]All these were persevering unanimously in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary mother of Jesus, with his brethren.[15]And in these days Peter having risen in the midst of the disciples, said, (also the crowd of names together was about an hundred and twenty,)[16]Men, brethren, this writing must be filled up, which the Holy Spirit spake before by mouth of David concerning Judas, being guide to them having taken Jesus.[17]For he was numbered with us, and obtained the lot of this service.[18]Truly this therefore purchased a place from the wages of iniquity; and being bent forward, he brake in pieces in the midst, and all his entrails were poured out.[19]And it was known to all dwelling in Jerusalem; so that that place was called in their own dialect, Aceldama, that is, The place of blood.[20]For it has been written, in the book of Psalms, Let his country-house be a desert, and let none be dwelling in it: and his inspection may another take.[21]Therefore must there, of these men having come with us in all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and came out among us,[22]Having begun from the immersion of John, unto the day which he was taken up from us, be one of these a witness with you of his rising up.[23]And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.[24]And having prayed, they said, Thou, O Lord, knowing hearts of all, spew forth one of two which thou hast chosen,[25]To take the lot of this service and sending forth, from which Judas passed by, to go to his own place.[26]And he gave their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was voted together with the eleven sent.","Acts.2":"[1]And in the day of Pentecost being completed, they were all unanimously in one and the same place.[2]And suddenly was a sound from heaven as of a wind moving violently, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.[3]And seen to them were tongues divided as fire, and it sat upon each one of them.[4]And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them to utter.[5]And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, circumspect men, from every nation of those under heaven.[6]And there having been this voice, the multitude came together, and were disturbed, for each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.[7]And all were affected in mind and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not these speaking Galileans.[8]And how hear we each in our own dialect, in which we were born?[9]Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and they dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,[10]And Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Lybia that near Cyrene, and Romans arriving as strangers, and Jews, and strangers,[11]Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.[12]And all were affected in mind, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What may this mean to be?[13]And others mocking said, That they are filled with new wine.[14]And Peter, having stood with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men Jews, and all ye dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hear ye my words:[15]For not, as ye suppose, are these intoxicated, (for it is the third hour of the day.)[16]But this is that spoken by the prophet Joel;[17]And it shall be in the last days, says God, I pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elder dream dreams:[18]And also upon my servants and upon my maids in those days will I pour out from my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:[19]And I will give wonders in heaven above, and signs upon the earth below; blood, and fire, and steam of smoke:[20]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and distinguished day of the Lord come:[21]And it shall be, every one, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.[22]Men, Israelites, bear these words; Jesus the Nazarite, a man elected by God for you by powers and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, (as also ye yourselves know:)[23]This one, surrendered by the fixed counsel and foreknowledge of God, having taken by lawless hands, having fastened, ye slew:[24]Whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death: as it was not possible for him to be holden of it.[25]For David says about him, I saw beforehand the Lord before me always, for he is of my right hand, that I be not moved:[26]For this my heart was gladdened, and my tongue was transported with joy; and yet also shall my flesh encamp in hope:[27]For thou wilt not leave my soul in hades neither wilt thou give thy sanctified one to see corruption.[28]Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with gladness with thy face.[29]Men, brethren, it is permitted to speak with freedom of speech to you of the patriarch David, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us even till this day.[30]Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God swore with an oath to him, of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up Christ to sit upon his throne:[31]Foreknowing, he spake of the rising up of Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.[32]This Jesus God raised up, of which all we are witnesses.[33]Therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this, which ye now see and hear.[34]For David ascended not into the heavens: and he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand,[35]Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.[36]Therefore let all the house of Israel know certainly, that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.[37]And having heard, they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the sent, What shall we do, men, brethren?[38]And Peter said to them, Repent, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.[39]For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all afar off, as many as the Lord our God should call.[40]And with many other words he appealed earnestly and besought, saying, Be ye saved from this crooked generation.[41]Then truly they having gladly received his word were immersed: and in that day were added about three thousand souls.[42]And they were persevering in the teaching of the sent, and in mutual participation, and breaking of bread, and prayers.[43]And to every soul was fear: and through the sent were many wonders and signs.[44]And all believing were in one and the same place, and had all things common:[45]And sold possessions and goods, and divided them to all, as any one had need.[46]And in the day persevering unanimously in the temple, and breaking bread in the house, they partook of food with lively joy and simplicity of heart,[47]Praising God, and having favor with the whole people. And in the day the Lord added the saved to the church.","Acts.3":"[1]And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth.[2]And a certain man, being lame from his mother’s womb, was carried, whom they set in the day at the door of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms from those going into the temple;[3]Who having seen Peter and John about going into the temple asked to receive alms.[4]And Peter, having looked intently upon him with John, said, Look upon us.[5]And he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to receive something of them.[6]And Peter said, Silver and gold are not to me; but what I have, this I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarite, arise and walk.[7]And having taken him by the right hand, he raised: and immediately his feet and ankles were rendered firm.[8]And springing forth he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and springing, and praising God.[9]And all the people saw him walking and praising God:[10]And they knew him, that this was he sitting for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that having happened to him.[11]And the lame healed holding Peter and John, all the people ran to them in the porch called Solomon’s, much amazed.[12]And Peter, having seen, answered to the people, men, Israelites, why wonder ye at this? or why look ye intently at us, as by our own power or devotion having made him to walk?[13]The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, God of our fathers, has honoured his child Jesus; whom ye have delivered up, and denied him before the face of Pilate, he having judged to loose.[14]And ye denied the Holy and Just, and demanded a man, a murderer, to be yielded to you.[15]And ye killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead; of whom we are witnesses.[16]And by faith of his name, this, whom ye see and know, his name made firm, and faith which by him, gave him this completeness before you all.[17]And now, brethren, I know that ye did in ignorance, as also your rulers.[18]But God, announced these things beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, for Christ to suffer, he so completed.[19]Therefore repent, and return, for your sins to be wiped out, so that times of refreshment might come from the face of the Lord;[20]And he send Jesus Christ, before proclaimed to you,[21]Whom heaven must truly receive till time of restoration of all which God spake by the mouth of all his holy prophets from forever.[22]For Moses truly said to the fathers, That a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you from your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear according to all whatever he speak to you.[23]And it shall be, whoever hears not that prophet, shall be destroyed from the people.[24]And all the prophets from Samuel, and those in order, as many as spake, also announced beforehand these days.[25]Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God set with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all families of earth be praised.[26]To you first God, having raised up his child Jesus, sent him praising you, in turning away each from your wickedness.","Acts.4":"[1]And they speaking to the people, the priests, and commander of the temple, and the Sadducees, resisted them,[2]Being exercised because they taught the people, and announced in Jesus the rising up from the dead.[3]And they put hands upon them, and set in guard for the morrow: for it was already evening.[4]And many of them having heard the word, believed; and the number of men was about five thousand.[5]And it was on the morrow, their rulers, and elders, and scribes, were gathered together at Jerusalem,[6]And Annas, chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the lineage of the chief priest.[7]And having set them in the midst, they inquired, In what power, or in what name did ye do this?[8]Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,[9]If we are this day examined of the kindness of the sick man, by whom he has been saved;[10]Be it known to all you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarite, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this he stands before you whole.[11]This is the stone set at nought by you building, he having been for the head of the corner.[12]And salvation is in no other: for neither is another name given under heaven among men, in which we must be saved.[13]And seeing the freedom of speech of Peter and John, and comprehending that they are illiterate men, and private individuals, they wondered; and they knew them, that they were with Jesus.[14]And seeing the man healed standing with them, they had nothing to contradict.[15]And having urged them to depart out of the council, they deliberated with one another,[16]Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that truly a known sign has been by them, manifest to all them dwelling in Jerusalem: and we cannot deny.[17]But that it be not more and more exposed to the wind among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, to speak no more in this name to any man.[18]And having called them, they enjoined them universally not to utter neither to teach in the name of Jesus.[19]And Peter and John having answered to them, said, If it is just before God to hear you rather than God, judge ye.[20]For we cannot, the things we have seen and heard, not speak.[21]And they having made additional threats, loosed them, finding nothing how they might chastise them, for sake of the people: for all honoured God for that having been done.[22]For the man was more than forty years, upon whom this sign of healing was done.[23]And having been loosed, they came to their own, and announced to them what the chief priests and elders said.[24]And they, having heard, lifted up the voice unanimously to God, and said, Sovereign, thou God having made heaven, and earth, and sea, and all things which in them:[25]Having said by the mouth of David thy servant, That why were the nations insolent, and did the people practise vain things.[26]Kings of the earth stood up, and rulers were gathered together upon one and the same, against the Lord, and against his Christ.[27]For against the truth were they gathered together against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations and peoples of Israel,[28]To do what thy hands and thy counsel predestinated to be.[29]And now, Lord, look upon their threats: and give to thy servants, with all freedom of speech to speak thy word,[30]In thy stretching out thy hand for healing; and signs and wonders to be for the name of thine holy child Jesus.[31]And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spake the word of God with freedom of speech.[32]And the heart and soul of the multitude of them believing were one: and not one said any of the things being to him to be his own; but all were common to them.[33]And in great power the sent gave back testimony of the rising up of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.[34]For neither was any in want among them: for as many as were possessors of farms or houses, selling, brought the prices of things sold,[35]And laid down at the feet of the sent: and it was distributed to each as any had need.[36]And Joses, surnamed Barnabas by the sent, (which is interpreted, Son of consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian by birth,[37]A field being to him having sold, he brought the money and laid at the feet of the sent.","Acts.5":"[1]And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,[2]And separated from the price, his wife also knowing; and having brought a certain part, laid at the feet of the sent.[3]And Peter said, Ananias, wherefore filled Satan thy heart, for thee to belie the Holy Spirit, and separate from the price of the farm.[4]Remaining, did it not remain to thee? and sold, it was in thy power: for what hast thou put this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God.[5]And Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, he expired: and great fear was upon all them hearing these things.[6]And the younger having risen up, drew him together, and having carried out, interred.[7]And there was an interval of about three hours, and his wife not knowing that done, came in.[8]And Peter answered to her, Tell me, if for so much ye sold the farm? And she said, Yes, for so much.[9]And Peter said to her, For what was it agreed by you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them having interred thy husband at the door, and they shall carry thee out.[10]And she fell immediately at his feet, and expired: and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried out, interred near her husband.[11]And great fear was upon the whole church, and upon all having heard these things.[12]And by the bands of the sent were many signs and wonders among the people; (and all were unanimously in Solomon’s porch.[13]And of them remaining none dared join them: but the people magnified them.[14]And the believing were the more added to the Lord, multitudes of men and also of women.)[15]So that the sick were brought into the streets, and laid upon beds and couches, that Peter coming, even the shadow might overshadow certain of them.[16]And a multitude also came together of them all around the cities to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and the molested by unclean spirits: who were all healed.[17]And the chief priest having risen, and all they with him, (the sect being of the Sadducees,) they were filled with zeal,[18]And put their hands upon the sent, and set them in the public keeping.[19]And a messenger of the Lord by night opened the doors of the prison, and having brought them forth, said,[20]Go ye, and having stood, speak in the temple all the words of this life.[21]And having heard, they came in by morning to the temple, and taught. But the chief priest having approached, and they with him, called the council together, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison for them to be brought.[22]And the attendants having come near, found them not in the prison, and having returned, they announced,[23]Saying, That we truly found the prison shut with all security, and the watch standing without before the doors: and having opened, we found none within.[24]And when the priest and captain of the temple and chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt of them, what this might be.[25]And a certain one having come near, announced to them, saying, That, behold, the men which ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.[26]Then the commander having gone with attendants, brought them, not with force: for they feared the people, lest they might be stoned.[27]And having brought them, they set in the council: and the chief priest asked them,[28]Saying, Did we not announce to you by order, not to teach by this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and ye desire to bring upon us this man’s blood.[29]And Peter having answered, and the sent, said, We must obey God rather than men.[30]The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew with your own hands, having hung him upon a tree.[31]This, God exalted, a Chief and Saviour, with his right hand to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.[32]And we are his witnesses of these words; and the Holy Spirit, whom God gave to them obeying him.[33]And having heard, they gnashed the teeth with rage, and consulted to kill them.[34]And a certain Pharisee having risen up in the council, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honoured by all the people, urged to put the sent without a little while.[35]And he said to them, Men, Israelites, attend to yourselves on account of these men, what ye are about to do.[36]For before these days Theudas arose, saying himself to be somebody: which a number of men followed, about four hundred, who was slain; and all, as many as believed him, were destroyed, and were for nothing.[37]After this Judas the Galilean arose in the days of enrolling, and misled enough people after him: and he perished; and all, as many as believed him, were scattered.[38]And now say I to you, Depart from these men, and leave them; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it shall be destroyed:[39]And if it is of God, ye cannot destroy it; lest ye also be found contenders against God.[40]And by him they were persuaded: and having called the sent, having stripped, they enjoined not to speak in the name of Jesus, and loosed them.[41]Truly therefore they went rejoicing from the face of the council, that for his name they were deemed worthy to be dishonoured.[42]And every day in the temple, and at the house, they ceased not teaching and announcing the good news, Jesus the Christ.","Acts.6":"[1]And in those days, the disciples multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily service.[2]And the twelve having called the multitude of the disciples, said, It is not pleasing for us, having left the word of God, to serve tables.[3]Therefore, survey, brethren, seven men of you, being witnesses full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom ye shall set over this need.[4]And we will persevere in prayer, and the service of the word.[5]And the word pleased before all the multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:[6]Whom they set before the sent: and having prayed, they put hands upon them.[7]And the word of God increased: and the number of disciples was multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and a great crowd of priests listened to the faith.[8]And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.[9]And certain of them arose from the synagogue, called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrian, and of them from Cilicia and Asia, seeking out with Stephen.[10]And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.[11]Then they put under men, saying, That we have heard him speaking defaming words against Moses, and God.[12]And they roused together the people, and elders, and scribes, and having stood against, they seized him, and brought to the council,[13]And set false witnesses, saying, This man ceases not speaking defaming words against this holy place, and the law:[14]For we have heard him saying; That Jesus the Nazarite shall abolish this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.[15]And all they sitting in the council, having looked intently upon him, saw his face as the face of a messenger.","Acts.7":"[1]And the chief priest said, Hold these things thus?[2]And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye: The God of glory was sent to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,[3]And he said to him, Come out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.[4]Then having come out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Charran: and thence, after his father died, he transplanted him into this land, in which ye now dwell.[5]And he gave him none inheritance in it, not a step of the foot: and he promised to give it him for a possession, and to his seed after him, there being no child to him.[6]And God spake thus, That his seed shall be dwelling in a strange land; and it shall subjugate them, and inflict evil four hundred years.[7]And the nation which they serve will I judge, said God: and after these shall they go out, and shall serve me in this place.[8]And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob; and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.[9]And the patriarchs having been jealous, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,[10]And took him out of all his pressures, and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and set him leader over Egypt and his whole house.[11]And a famine came upon the whole land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great pressure: and our fathers found no food.[12]And Jacob having beard wheat being in Egypt, sent our fathers first.[13]And in the second time, Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race was manifest to Pharaoh.[14]And Joseph having sent, called for his father Jacob, and all his kindred, in seventy-five souls.[15]And Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,[16]And they transported him to Sychem and put him in the tomb which Abraham was satisfied with for a price of silver from the sons of Emmor of Sychem.[17]And as the time of the solemn promise drew near, which God aware to Abraham, the people increased and were multiplied in Egypt.[18]Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.[19]He having deceived our race by sophistry, inflicted evil upon our fathers, to make their babes cast out, that they should not breed.[20]In which time Moses was born, and he was shrewd to God, who was nourished up three months in his father’s house:[21]And he having been exposed, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for a son to herself.[22]And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in words and in works.[23]And when the time of forty years was completed to him, it came up upon his heart to take a view of his brethren the sons of Israel.[24]And having seen a certain one injured, he defended, and did vengeance for him harassed, having struck the Egyptian,[25]And he supposed his brethren to understand that God by his hand gives them salvation: and they understood not.[26]And the following day he was seen to those contending, and he compelled them to peace, having said, Men, ye are brethren; wherefore injure ye one another?[27]And he injuring the neighbor repulsed him, having said, Who set thee a ruler and judge over us?[28]Wilt thou not kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?[29]And Moses fled at this word, and he was a sojourner in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.[30]And forty years completed, a messenger of the Lord was seen to him in the desert of mount Sina, in a flame of fire in a bramble.[31]And Moses having seen, wondered at the sight: and he coming near to observe attentively, the voice of the Lord was to him,[32]I the God of thy fathers, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. And Moses being trembling, dared not observe attentively.[33]And the Lord said to him, Loose the shoes of thy feet: for the place in which thou standest is holy land.[34]Having seen, I saw the injury of my people in Egypt, and I heard their groaning, and came down to take them away. And now came, I will send thee into Egypt.[35]This Moses which they denied, having said, Who set thee ruler and judge? this, God sent, a ruler and redeemer by the hand of the messenger having been seen to him in the bramble.[36]He brought them out, having done wonders and sign in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the desert forty years.[37]This is Moses, having said to the sons of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear.[38]This is he having been in the church in the desert with the messenger speaking to him in Mount Sina, and our fathers: who received the living oracles to give to us:[39]To whom our fathers would not be obedient, but rejected, and in their hearts they turned back into Egypt,[40]Having said to Aaron, Make us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has been to him.[41]And they made a calf in those days, and brought up a sacrifice to the image, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.[42]And God turned, and delivered them up to serve the army of heaven; as it has been written in the book of the prophets, Slain victims and sacrifices brought ye not to me forty years in the desert, O house of Israel,[43]And ye took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, types which ye made to worship them: and I will transplant you beyond Babylon.[44]The tent of testimony was with our fathers in the desert, as he speaking set to Moses, to make it according to the type which he had seen.[45]Which also our fathers having received brought in with Jesus in the possession of nations, which God drove out from our fathers’ face, even to the days of David;[46]Who found grace before God, and asked to find a tent to the God of Jacob.[47]And Solomon built for himself a house.[48]But the Highest dwells not in temples made by hands; as says the prophet,[49]Heaven a throne to me, and earth the footstool of my feet: what house will ye build to me? says the Lord: or what the place of my rest?[50]Did not my hand make all these things?[51]Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers, also you.[52]Which of the prophets did not your fathers drive out and they slew them announcing beforehand of the coming of the Just; of whom ye have now been traitors and murderers:[53]Who have received the law by the regulations of messengers, and ye watched not.[54]And having heard those, they were sawn through their hearts, and they gnashed the teeth upon him.[55]And being full of the Holy Spirit, having looked intently to heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,[56]And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.[57]And having cried with a great voice, they held fast their ears, and rushed unanimously upon him,[58]And having cast out of the city, they stoned: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.[59]And they stoned Stephen, calling upon, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.[60]And having set the knees, he cried with a great voice, Lord, wouldest thou not set this sin to them. And having said this he was set to sleep.","Acts.8":"[1]And Saul was assenting to his murder. And in that day was a great expulsion upon the church in Jerusalem; and all were scattered up and down in the countries of Judea and Samaria, except the sent.[2]And circumspect men interred Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.[3]And Saul abused the church, going into houses, and drawing out men and women, delivered to prison.[4]Truly therefore the dispersed passed through announcing good news the word.[5]And Philip having come down to the city of Samaria, proclaimed Christ to them.[6]And the crowds unanimously attended to things spoken by Philip, in their hearing and seeing the signs which he did.[7]For of many having unclean spirits, crying with a great voice, they came out: and many affected with palsy, and the lame, were healed.[8]And great joy was in that city.[9]And a certain man, Simon by name, was before in the city using magic, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be somebody great:[10]To whom attended from little to great, saying, This is the great power of God.[11]And they attended to him, because for a sufficient time they were astonished by magics.[12]And when they believed Philip announcing the good news of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.[13]And Simon also himself believed: and having been immersed, he was persevering with Philip, beholding the signs and great powers having been, they were astonished.[14]And the sent in Jerusalem having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John:[15]Who, having gone down, prayed for them, that they receive the Holy Spirit.[16](For not yet was it fallen upon any of them: only they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.)[17]Then put they hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.[18]And Simon having seen that by putting on of hands of the sent the Holy Spirit is given, he brought money to them,[19]Saying, Give me also this power, that upon whomsoever I put hands, he might receive the Holy Spirit.[20]And Peter said to him, May thy silver be for ruin with thee, for thou thoughtest the gift of God to be purchased for money.[21]No portion is to thee, nor lot, in this word: for thy heart is not upright before God.[22]Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart be remitted to thee.[23]For I see thee being in the bile of bitterness, and bond of iniquity.[24]And Simon having answered, said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that nothing which ye have spoken come upon me.[25]Truly therefore, they having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced good news to many towns of the Samaritans.[26]And a messenger of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise, and go at noon in the way going down from Jerusalem to Gaza, (this is desert.)[27]And having risen, he went: and, behold, an Ethiopian man, an eunuch of great power of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come going to worship in Jerusalem,[28]And he was returning, and sitting in his chariot he read the prophet Esaias.[29]And the Spirit said to Philip, Come near, and be joined to this chariot.[30]And Philip running near, heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and he said, Truly knowest thou what thou readest?[31]And he said, How can I, except somebody guide me? And he called upon Philip coming up to sit with him.[32]And the passage of the writing which he read was this, As a sheep for slaughter was he brought; and as a lamb before him shearing it dumb, so he opened not his mouth:[33]In his humiliation was his judgment taken away: and his generation who shall recount? for his life is taken from the earth.[34]And the eunuch having answered Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom speaks the prophet this of himself or of some other?[35]And Philip having opened his mouth, and begun from this writing, announced to him the good news, Jesus.[36]And as they went in the way, they came to some water: and the eunuch said, Behold water; what hinders me to be immersed?[38]And he ordered the chariot to stand: and both went down into the Water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he immersed him.[39]And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: for he went his way rejoicing.[40]And Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he announced the good news to all of the cities, even till he came to Cesarea.","Acts.9":"[1]And Saul, yet breathing out threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, having come to the chief priest,[2]He asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he find certain men being of the way, and also women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.[3]And in going, it was he drawing near to Damascus: and suddenly a light from heaven flashed with lightning around him:[4]And having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, Why drivest thou me out?[5]And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou drivest out: hard for thee to kick against goads.[6]And he trembling and amazed said, Lord, What wilt thou me to do? And the Lord to him, Arise, and come into the city, and it shall be spoken to thee what thou must do.[7]And the men journeying with him stood astonished, hearing the voice truly, and seeing no one.[8]And Saul was raised up from the earth; and his eyes being opened, he saw no one: and leading him by the hand, they brought him to Damascus.[9]And he was three days not seeing, and he ate not, nor drank.[10]And a certain disciple was in Damascus, Ananias by name; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I, Lord.[11]And the Lord to him, Having risen, go thou to the street called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas Saul by name, of Tarsus; for, behold, he prays,[12]And he saw in a vision a man, by name Ananias, coming in, and having put hand upon him, so that he might look up and see again.[13]And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evils he did to thy holy ones in Jerusalem:[14]And here has he authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on thy name.[15]And the Lord said to him, Go: for he is a vessel of choice to me, to lift up my name before nations, and kings, and the sons of Israel:[16]For I will show him what he must suffer for my name.[17]And Ananias departed, and came into the house; and having put hands upon him said, Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me, Jesus, he seen to thee in the way which thou earnest, so that thou mightest look up, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.[18]And quickly there fell from his eyes as scales: and he immediately looked up, and having risen, he was immersed.[19]And having taken food, he was strong. And Saul was in Damascus with the disciples certain days.[20]And quickly in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.[21]And all they hearing were affected in mind, and said: Is not this he having laid waste in Jerusalem those calling upon this name, and he has come here for this, that he might bring them having been bound to the chief priests?[22]And Saul was the more strengthened, and confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus, demonstrating that this is the Christ.[23]And when sufficient days were completed, the Jews counselled together to put him to death:[24]But this project was known to Saul. And they observed narrowly the gates day, and also night, that they might kill him.[25]And the disciples having taken him by night, put through the wall, having let down in a wicker basket.[26]And Saul being present in Jerusalem, tried to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple.[27]And Barnabas having taken him, brought him to the sent, and recounted to them how in the way he saw the Lord, and that he spake to him, and how in Damascus he spake freely in the name of Jesus.[28]And he was with them going in and going out in Jerusalem, and speaking freely in the name of the Lord Jesus.[29]And he spake and sought out with the Greeks; but they purposed to kill him.[30]And the brethren having known, brought him down to Cesarea, and they sent him forth to Tarsus.[31]Then truly the churches through the Whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria, had peace, being built up; and going in the fear of the Lord, and in the consolation of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.[32]And it was Peter, passing through all, came down also to the holy ones dwelling in Lydda.[33]And he found there a certain man, Eneas by name, lying upon a bed of eight years, who was affected with palsy.[34]And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ heals thee; arise, and cover thyself. And he arose quickly.[35]And all dwelling in Lydda and Saron saw him, who turned back to the Lord.[36]And in Joppa was a certain disciple by name Tabitha, which interpreted is called Dorcas: she was full of good works and alms which she did.[37]And it was in those days, having been sick, she died; and having washed, they laid her in an upper room.[38]And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in it, sent to him two men, beseeching not to hesitate to pass through even to them.[39]And Peter having risen came with them. Whom having approached, they brought into the upper room: and all the widows stood before him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, being with them.[40]And Peter having put them all without, having set the knees, prayed; and having turned back to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and having seen Peter, sat up.[41]And having given her the hand, he raised her up, and having called the holy ones and the widows, he placed her living before them.[42]And it was known through the whole of Joppa: and many believed upon the Lord.[43]And days sufficient he remained in Joppa with a certain Simon, a currier.","Acts.10":"[1]And a certain man was in Cesarea by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italian,[2]Religious, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many alms to the people, and praying God always.[3]He saw in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the day a messenger of God having come in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.[4]And having looked at him intently, and being afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms went up for remembrance before God.[5]And now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon, who is called Peter:[6]He is received as guest with a certain Simon a currier, to whom is a house by the sea: he shall speak to thee what thou must do.[7]And when the messenger speaking to Cornelius departed, having called two of his servants, and a religious soldier of those persevering with him;[8]And having related all to them, he sent them to Joppa.[9]And the morrow, these traveling, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the house to pray about the sixth hour:[10]And he was hungry, and would have eaten: and these making ready, a deep trance fell upon him,[11]And he sees heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as a great linen napkin fastened at the four beginnings, and laid down upon the earth:[12]In which were all the quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the flying things of heaven.[13]And a voice was to him, Having risen, Peter, kill, and eat.[14]And Peter said, By no means, Lord; for never ate I anything common or unclean.[15]And a voice again of a second time to him, What things God cleansed, do not thou make common.[16]And this was for thrice: and again was the vessel taken up into heaven.[17]And as Peter was doubting in himself what the vision might be which he saw, and behold, the man sent from Cornelius having asked for Simon’s house, stood at the gate,[18]And having called, they were inquiring if Simon, surnamed Peter, is received there as a guest.[19]And Peter reflecting concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee.[20]But thou having risen, come down, and go with them, discussing nothing; for I have sent them.[21]And Peter having come down to the men sent from Cornelius to him, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what the cause for which ye are present?[22]And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and witnessed of by the whole nation of the Jews, received intimation of the divine will by a holy messenger to send for thee to his house, and hear words of thee.[23]Therefore having called them in, he received as guests. And on the morrow Peter came forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa came with him.[24]And the morrow he came to Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and friends by relationship.[25]And it was as Peter came in, Cornelius having met him, having fallen at his feet, worshipped.[26]And Peter raised him up, saying, Arise: I am also myself man.[27]And discoursing with him, he came in, and finds many come together.[28]And he said to them, Ye know that it is violating law for a man a Jew to join himself, or come near to a strange tribe: and God shewed me to call no man common or unclean.[29]And therefore came I without contradiction, having been sent for; therefore I inquire for what word ye sent for me?[30]And Cornelius said, From the fourth day till this hour I was fasting; and the ninth hour praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,[31]And he says, Cornelius, thy prayer was harkened to, and thine alms remembered before God.[32]Therefore send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he is received as guest in the house of Simon the currier by the sea: who, being present, shall speak to thee.[33]From this therefore sent I to thee: and thou didst well being present. Now therefore are all we present before God, to hear all commanded thee of God.[34]And Peter having opened the month; said, of a truth I comprehend that God is no respecter of faces![35]But in every nation he fearing him, and working justice, is acceptable to him.[36]The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, announcing good news, peace through Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all.)[37]The word ye know, having been through the whole of Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached;[38]Jesus from Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and power; who passed through doing good, and healing all oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.[39]And ye are witnesses of all which he did in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they killed, having hanged upon wood:[40]Him God raised the third day, and gave him to be manifest;[41]Not to all people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.[42]And he enjoined us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that this is he appointed by God, Judge of the living and the dead.[43]To him all the prophets testify, for all believing on him to receive remission of sins through his name.[44]Peter yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all hearing the word.[45]And believers of the circumcision were affected in mind, as many as came with Peter, that also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.[46]For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then answered Peter,[47]Much less can any hinder water, for these not to be immersed, who received the Holy Spirit as also we?[48]And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then asked they him to remain certain days.","Acts.11":"[1]And the apostles and brethren, those being in Judea, heard that the nations also received the word of God.[2]And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision discussed with him,[3]Saying, That thou camest in to men having uncircumcision, and didst eat With them.[4]And Peter having begun, set forth to them in order, saying,[5]I was in the city Joppa, praying: and in a deep trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descending as a great linen napkin, let down from heaven by four beginnings; and it came even to me:[6]Upon which having looked intently, I observed, and saw quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the flying things of heaven.[7]And I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, kill and eat.[8]And I said, By no means, Lord: for anything common or unclean never came into my month.[9]And a voice answered me of a second time from heaven, What God cleansed, profane not.[10]And this was for thrice: and again all was drawn up into heaven.[11]And, behold, from this three men stood at the house in which I was, sent from Cesarea to me.[12]And the spirit said to me to come with them, discussing nothing. And these six brethren came also with me, and we came to the man’s house:[13]And he announced to us how he saw a messenger in his house, having stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon, surnamed Peter.[14]Who shall speak words to thee, by which thou shalt be saved and all thy house.[15]And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as also upon us in the beginning.[16]And I remembered the word of the Lord, when he said, John truly immersed with water; but ye shall be immersed with the Holy Spirit.[17]If therefore God gave the like gift to them as also to us, having believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; how was I able to hinder God.[18]And having heard these, they were silent, and honoured God, saying, For also God gave the nations repentance to life.[19]Therefore truly those dispersed by the pressure having been on account of Stephen, passed through even to Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except the Jews only.[20]And certain of them were Cyprian and Cyrenian men, who having come to Antioch, spake to the Greeks announcing good news, the Lord Jesus.[21]And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number having believed, turned to the Lord.[22]And the word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem concerning them: and they sent Barnabas to pass through even to Antioch.[23]Who, having been present, and seen the grace of God, rejoiced, and besought them all, with purpose of heart, to remain to the Lord.[24]For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a crowd sufficient were added to the Lord.[25]And Barnabas came forth to Tarsus, to seek Saul.[26]And having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it was for a whole year they were assembled together in the churches, and taught a sufficient crowd. And the disciples were Christians by divine intimation first in Antioch.[27]In these days came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.[28]And one of them having risen, Agabus by name, signified by the Holy Spirit a great famine was about to be upon the whole habitable globe: which was during Claudius Caesar.[29]And certain of the disciples, as he was able, determined, each of them, to send for service to the brethren dwelling in Judea:[30]Which also they did, having sent to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.","Acts.12":"[1]And at that time Herod the king laid hands upon to injure certain of the church.[2]And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.[3]And having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added also to take Peter. (They were the days of unleavened bread.)[4]And having seized, he put him in prison, having delivered to four quaternions of soldiers to watch him; wishing after the pascha to bring him to the people.[5]Truly therefore was Peter kept in prison: and prayer was made continually by the church to God for him.[6]And when Herod was about to bring him before, in that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the watch before the door kept the prison.[7]And, behold, the messenger of the Lord stood before, and a light shone in the dwelling: and having struck Peter’s side, he raised him up, saying, Arise quickly. And his chains fell off from the hands.[8]And the messenger said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy small sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Put round thy garment, and follow me.[9]And having come out, he followed him; and knew not that it is true that being done by the messenger; and seemed to see a vision.[10]And having passed by the first and second watch, they came to the iron gate leading to the city; which of its free will was opened to them: and having come out, they advanced one street; and quickly the messenger departed from him.[11]And Peter being as himself, said, Now know I truly that the Lord sent his messenger, and took me out of the hands of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.[12]And being conscious, he came to the house of Mary mother of John, surnamed Mark; where were sufficient assembled, and praying.[13]And Peter having knocked at the door of the gate, a young girl came near to listen, by name Rhoda.[14]And having known Peter’s voice, from joy she opened not the gate, and running, announced Peter to stand before the gate.[15]And they said to her, Thou art mad. And she was strengthened to have it so. And they said, It is his messenger.[16]And Peter continued knocking: and having opened, they saw him, and were moved.[17]And having shaken with the hand at them to be silent, he related to them how the Lord brought him out of prison. And he said, Announce these things to James, and the brethren. And having come out, he went to another place.[18]And it being day, not a little trouble was among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.[19]And Herod having sought him, and not found, having examined the watch, commanded them to be removed. And having come down from Judea to Cesarea, he tarried.[20]And Herod was fighting with violent animosity, with Tyrians and Sidonians: but they came unanimously to him, and having conciliated Blastus, him over the king’s bed-chamber, they asked peace; for their country was nourished from the king’s.[21]And upon a fixed day, Herod, having put on royal apparel, and having sat upon the judgment seat, harangued them.[22]And the people called aloud, The voice of God, and not of man.[23]And immediately the messenger of the Lord struck him, because he gave not the glory to God: and eaten by worms, he expired.[24]And the word of God increased and multiplied.[25]And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having completed the service, and taken with them John, surnamed Mark.","Acts.13":"[1]And certain prophets and teachers were in the church being in Antioch; as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.[2]And they serving the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate to me Barnabas and Saul to the work which I have called them.[3]Then having fasted and prayed, and put hands upon them, they let go.[4]Therefore these truly, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, came down to Seleucia and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.[5]And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John a servant.[6]And having passed through the island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, the name to him Barjesus:[7]Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paul, an intelligent man; he having called Barnabas and Saul, sought anxiously to hear the word of God.[8]And Elymas the magician withstood them, (for so was his name interpreted,) seeking to turn the proconsul from the faith.[9]And Saul, (also Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, and looking intently upon him, said,[10]O, full of deceit, and all dexterity, son of the devil, enemy of all justice, Wilt thou cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?[11]And now, behold, the hand of the Lord upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun till the time. And immediately fell upon him mist and darkness; and going about he sought leading by hand.[12]Then the proconsul having seen that done, he believed, being struck with amazement at the teaching of the Lord.[13]And having been brought from Paphos, they about Paul came to Perga of Pamphylia: and John, having departed from them, returned to Jerusalem.[14]And they having passed from Perga, approached Antioch of Pisidia, and having come into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.[15]And after reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brethren, if the word of encouragement is in you to the people, speak.[16]And Paul having risen, and shaken with the hand, said, Men, Israelites, and ye fearing God, hear ye.[17]God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people in sojourning the land of Egypt, and with high arm brought them out of it.[18]And about forty years time he bare them in the desert.[19]And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he gave them to inherit this land by lot.[20]And after these, about four hundred and fifty years he gave judges, even to Samuel the prophet.[21]And thence they desired a king; and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.[22]And having removed him, he raised up to them David for king; to whom also having testified, he said, I found David of Jesse, a man according to my heart, who shall do all my desires.[23]From the seed of this has God according to promise raised up to Israel a Saviour, Jesus:[24]John having proclaimed before the face of his coming the immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.[25]And as John completed the course, be said, Whom think ye me to be? I am not. But, behold, he comes after me, whose shoes of the feet I am not worthy to loose.[26]Men, brethren, sons of Abraham’s race, and those among you fearing God, to you was the word of this salvation sent.[27]For they dwelling in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known him, and the voices of the prophets which being read in every sabbath, having judged, they filled up.[28]And having found no cause of death, they desired Pilate to have him slain.[29]And when they finished all things written concerning him, having taken down from the wood, they put in a tomb.[30]And God raised him from the dead:[31]Who was seen for many days to them having come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.[32]And we announce good news to you, the promise made to our fathers,[33]For this has God completed to us, their children, having raised up Jesus; as it has also been written in the second Psalms, Thou art my Son; to day have I begotten thee.[34]And that he raised him from the dead, no more about to return to corruption, so he said, That I will give you the holy, faithful things of David.[35]For also in another, he says, Thou shalt not give thy Holy one to see corruption.[36]For David, truly having served his own generation by the will of God, was set to sleep, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption:[37]But whom God raised up, he saw no corruption.[38]Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that for him remission of sins is announced to you.[39]And from all which ye could not be justified by Moses’ law, every one believing in him is justified.[40]See ye, therefore, that that spoken by the prophets come not upon you.[41]See, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, which ye would not believe if any recount to you.[42]And the Jews having gone out of the synagogue, the nations besought to have these words spoken in the sabbath between.[43]And the synagogue having been dissolved, many of the Jews and strangers worshipping, followed Paul and Barnabas: who speaking to them, persuaded them to remain in the grace of God.[44]And the next sabbath nearly all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God.[45]And the Jews, having seen the crowds, were filled with envy, and spake against the things said by Paul, contradicting and defaming.[46]And Paul and Barnabas speaking freely, said, To you was it first necessary for the word of God to be spoken: but since ye reject it, and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the nations.[47]For so has the Lord commanded us, I have set thee for a light of the nations, for thee to be for salvation even to the last of the earth.[48]And the nations having rejoiced, honoured the word of the Lord: and they believed, as many as were drawn out for eternal life.[49]And the word of the Lord was conveyed through the whole country.[50]And the Jews urged on the worshipping and distinguished women, and the first men of the city, and they raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and they cast them out of their bounds,[51]And they, having shaken off the cloud of the dust of their feet against them, came into Iconium.[52]And the disciples were filled with joy, and the Holy Spirit.","Acts.14":"[1]And it was in Iconium according to the same, went they into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude of the Jews and also of Greeks believed.[2]And the unbelieving Jews excited and trained up the souls of the nations against the brethren.[3]Therefore truly they remained a sufficient time speaking freely in the Lord, he testifying to the word of his grace, and giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands.[4]And the multitude of the city was divided: and some truly were with the Jews, and some with the sent.[5]And when there was a violent effort of the nations, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to be insolent, and to stone them,[6]Being conscious, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the country round about:[7]And there they were announcing the good news.[8]And a certain man in Lystra, not having strength in the feet, sat, being lame from his mother’s belly, who had never walked:[9]He having heard Paul speaking, who having looked intently upon him, and seen that he has faith to be cured,[10]Said with a great voice, Stand up upon thy feet upright: And he leaped and walked.[11]And the crowds having seen what Paul did, lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, Gods likened to men came down to us.[12]And truly they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, since he was leader of the word.[13]And Jupiter’s priest, being before their city, having brought bulls and crowns to the gates, wished to sacrifice with the crowd.[14]And Barnabas and Paul, the sent, having heard, having rent their garments, rushed in among the crowd, crying out,[15]And saying, Men, why do ye these things? We also are men of similar passions with you, announcing good news to turn you back from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and sea, and all in them:[16]Who in past generations suffered all nations to go in their ways.[17]And surely indeed he left not himself without witness, doing good, having given us rain from heaven, and fruitful times, filling our hearts with food and gladness.[18]And saying these, they scarcely hindered the crowds, not to sacrifice to them.[19]And Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, and stoned Paul, drew out of the city, supposing him to be dead.[20]And the disciples having surrounded him, having risen, he came into the city: and the morrow he came out with Barnabas to Derbe.[21]And having announced that city the good news, and made disciples sufficient, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,[22]And supporting the souls of the disciples, beseeching to remain in the faith, that through many pressures we must come into the kingdom of God.[23]And having chosen them elders in the church, having prayed with fasting, they set them before the Lord, in whom they had believed.[24]And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.[25]And having spoken the word in Perga, they came down to Attalia:[26]And thence they sailed away to Antioch, thence were they delivered by the grace of God to the work which they completed.[27]And having arrived, and gathered the church together, they announced what God did with them, and that he opened the door of faith to the nations.[28]And they tarried there not a little time with the disciples.","Acts.15":"[1]And certain having come down from Judea taught the brethren, That except ye be circumcised by Moses custom, ye cannot be saved.[2]Therefore dissension and no small discussion having been to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas to go up, and certain others of them, to the sent and elders in Jerusalem about this question.[3]Truly therefore the sent by the church passed through Phenice and Samaria, relating the turning back of the nations: and they made great joy to all the brethren.[4]And having arrived at Jerusalem they were received by the church, and the sent and elders, and they announced what God did with them.[5]And certain of them from the sect of the Pharisees having believed, rose up, saying, That they must be circumcised, and to enjoin to keep the law of Moses.[6]And the sent and elders were gathered together to see about this word.[7]And much discussion having been, Peter having risen up, said to them, Men, brethren, ye know that from ancient days God chose among us, through my month for the nations to hear the word of good news, and believe.[8]And God the knower of hearts testified to them, having given them the Holy Spirit, as also us;[9]And separated nothing between us and also them, by faith having purified their hearts.[10]Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?[11]But by grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we believe to be saved, as also they.[12]And all the multitude were silent, and heard Barnabas and Paul, recounting what signs and wonders God did in the nations through them.[13]And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brethren, hear me:[14]Simeon related how God first reviewed to take from the nations a people for his name.[15]And with this the words of the prophets agree: as has been written,[16]After these will I return, and rebuild the tent of David, having fallen; and its things undermined will I rebuild, and set it upright:[17]So that they remaining of men might seek out the Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name has been called upon them, says the Lord, making all these.[18]Known to God are all his works from eternity.[19]Wherefore I judge, not to molest them, from the nations turning back to God:[20]But to send to them, to keep off from pollutions of images, and harlotry, and strangulation, and blood.[21]For Moses of ancient generations has them proclaiming him in every city, being read in the synagogues in every sabbath.[22]Then it seemed fitting to the sent and the elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren:[23]Having written by their hand thus; The sent and elders and brethren to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia from the nations, health:[24]Since we heard that certain of us having come out have troubled you with words, destroying your souls, saying, To be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we sent no word:[25]It seemed fitting to us, having been unanimous, to send to you chosen men with our dearly beloved Barnabas and Paul,[26]Men having delivered up their souls for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.[27]Therefore have we sent Judas and Silas, and these by the word announcing these things.[28]For it seemed fitting to the Holy Spirit, and to us, for no more burden to be put upon you but the necessities of these;[29]To keep off from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and strangulation, and harlotry: from which keeping yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.[30]Truly therefore having been loosed, they came to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they gave up the epistle:[31]And having read, they rejoiced for the encouraging.[32]And Judas and Silas, they also being prophets, through much speech consoled the brethren, and supported.[33]And having made time, they were loosed with peace from the brethren to the sent.[35]And Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and announcing good news, with many others, the word of the Lord.[36]And after certain days said Paul to Barnabas, Now having turned back, let us review our brethren in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, how they hold.[37]And Barnabas purposed to take with them John, called Mark.[38]But Paul deemed worthy, having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and not having come with them to the work, not to take him with them.[39]Therefore there was an incitement, so that they separated from one another: and Barnabas, having taken Mark, sailed to Cyprus;[40]And Paul, having chosen Silas, went forth, having been delivered to the grace of God by the brethren.[41]And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, supporting the churches.","Acts.16":"[1]And he arrived at Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, by name Timothy, son of a certain woman, a faithful Jewess; and of a Greek father:[2]Who was testified of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.[3]Him Paul wished to go forth with him; and having taken, he circumcised him, on account of the Jews being in those places: for all knew his father that he was a Greek.[4]And as they were going through the cities, they delivered them the orders to watch, having been determined by the sent and the elders in Jerusalem.[5]Therefore truly the churches were rendered firm in faith, and abounded in number daily.[6]And having passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country, hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia,[7]Having come to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia: and the Spirit suffered them not.[8]And having passed by Mysia they came down to Troas.[9]And a vision was seen to Paul by night; A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing, beseeching him, and saying, Having passed to Macedonia, help us.[10]And when he saw the vision, we quickly sought to come out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord called us to announce good news to them.[11]Therefore having been conveyed from Troas, we ran straight forward to Samothracia, and the following day to Neapolis;[12]And thence to Philippi, which is the first city of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in that city passing certain days.[13]And the day of the sabbaths we came out of the city by the river, where prayer was customary to be; and having sat down, we spake to the women come together.[14]And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a dealer in purple garments, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, heard: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to things spoken by Paul.[15]And when she was immersed, and her house, she besought, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having come into my house, remain. And she forced us.[16]And it was we going for prayer, a certain young girl having the spirit of Python met us, who furnished much gain to her lords, prophesying:[17]She having followed Paul and us, cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who announce to us the way of salvation.[18]And this did she for many days. And Paul, having been exercised, and having turned back to the spirit, said, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.[19]And her lords having seen that the hope of their gain went out, taking Paul and Silas, they drew to the assembly to the rulers,[20]And having brought them to the generals, they said, These the men who cause disturbance to our city, being Jews,[21]And they announce customs, which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor do, being Romans.[22]And the crowd set together against them: and the generals having rent their garments, commanded to scourge with rods.[23]And many blows having been put upon them, they cast into prison, having commanded the jailor to keep them safely:[24]Who, having received such an order, cast them into the inner prison, and placed their feet firmly in wood.[25]And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, praised God: and the imprisoned heard them.[26]And suddenly was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all were let loose.[27]And the jailor being awakened, and having seen the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the imprisoned to have fled.[28]And Paul called with a great voice, saying, Thou shouldest do no injury to thyself; for we are all here.[29]And having asked for a light, he rushed in, and being trembling, fell before Paul and Silas,[30]And bringing them out, he said, Lords, what must I do that I might be saved.[31]And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.[32]And they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all in his house.[33]And having taken them in that hour of the night, he washed out the blows; and was immersed, he and all his, immediately.[34]And having brought them up to his house, he set a table before, and rejoiced with the entire household, having believed God.[35]And it being day, the generals sent the bearers of the rod, saying, Loose these men.[36]And the jailor announced these words to Paul, That the generals have sent that ye be loosed: now therefore having come out, go in peace.[37]But Paul said to them, Having stripped us publicly not condemned, being Roman men, they cast into prison and now do they cast us out secretly? not so; but having come themselves, let them bring us out.[38]And the bearer of the rod announced these words to the generals: and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans.[39]And having come they besought them, and having brought out, they entreated to come out of the city.[40]And having come out of prison, they came to Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they encouraged them, and they came forth.","Acts.17":"[1]And having passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:[2]And according to custom to Paul, he went in to them, and upon three sabbaths discussed with them from the writings,[3]Opening and setting before, that it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and rise from, the dead; and that this is Christ Jesus, whom I announce to you.[4]And certain of them were persuaded, and were assigned by lot to Paul and Silas; and of worshipping Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the first women.[5]And the unbelieving Jews, having been jealous, and having taken certain evil men of the vulgar, and excited to tumult, they disturbed the city by loud noise, and having stood against the house of Jason, they sought to bring them to the populace.[6]And not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying, That those having subverted the habitable globe, these also are present here;[7]Which Jason has received: and these all do opposite to Caesar’s enactments, saying, There is another king, Jesus.[8]And they troubled the crowd and rulers of the city, having heard these.[9]And having taken sufficient of Jason, and the rest, they loosed them.[10]And the brethren quickly sent out both Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who arriving went away to the synagogue of the Jews.[11]And they were of more noble birth than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all willingness, and examined the writings daily, if these things might hold thus.[12]Therefore truly many of them believed; and of the distinguished Grecian women, and of men, not few.[13]And when the Jews from Thessalonica heard that also in Berea the word of God was announced by Paul, they came there also, agitating the crowd.[14]And quickly the brethren sent away Paul to go as by the sea: and both Silas and Timothy remained there.[15]And they conveying Paul brought him even to Athens: and having taken a command to Silas and Timothy that now they might come to him most speedily, they departed.[16]And Paul waiting for them among the Athenians, his spirit was excited in him, seeing the city being addicted to idol worship.[17]Therefore truly he discussed in the synagogue with Jews, and those worshipping, and in the assembly in every day with those being present.[18]And certain of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers deliberated with him. And certain said, What may this idle, talkative man wish to say? and others, He seems to be a declarer of strange demons: because he announced to them good news, and the rising up.[19]And having taken him, they brought upon Mars’ hill, saying, Can we know what this new teaching is, spoken by thee?[20]For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we wish therefore to know what these things may be.[21]Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.[22]And Paul having stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, said, Men, Athenians, I see that in all things ye have a superstitious fear of divinity.[23]For having passed by, and beholding your venerations, I found also an altar upon which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom not knowing therefore ye reverence, him I announce to you.[24]God having made the world and all things in it, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made by hands;[25]Nor is served by men’s hands, standing in need of anything, he giving to all life, and breath, and all things.[26]And he made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having limited the times before arranged, and the bounds of their habitation;[27]To seek the Lord, if perchance indeed they have felt for him, and found, although not being far from each one of us:[28]For in him we live, and move, and are; as certain of the composers among you have said, For we also are his race.[29]Being therefore the posterity of God, we ought not to think gold, or silver, or stone, an engraving of art, or meditation of man, the divinity to be like.[30]Therefore truly, God having overlooked the times of ignorance, now announces to all men everywhere to repent:[31]Wherefore he set a day, in which he is about to judge the habitable globe in justice by the man whom he appointed; having offered faith to all, having raised him from the dead.[32]And having heard of the rising up of the dead, they treated with mockery; and said, We will hear thee again concerning this.[33]And so Paul went forth from the midst of them.[34]And certain men having joined him, believed: among whom also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.","Acts.18":"[1]And after these Paul having departed from Athens, came to Corinth;[2]And having found a certain Jew by name Aquila, a Pontian by birth, having recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife; (for Claudius had ordered all Jews to be separated from Rome:) came to them.[3]And because being of the same trade, he remained with them, and wrought: for they were by trade tentmakers.[4]And he discussed in the synagogue on every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.[5]And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was oppressed in spirit, testifying to the Jews Jesus Christ.[6]And they opposing, and blaspheming, having shaken off the garments violently, he said to them, Your blood upon your head; I clean: from now will I go to the nations.[7]And having gone away thence, he came to the house of a certain Justus by name, worshipping God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.[8]And Crispus, ruler of the synagogue, believed the Lord with his whole house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptised.[9]And the Lord said through a vision by night to Paul, Fear not, but speak, and thou shouldest not be silent:[10]For I am with thee, and none shall attack thee to injure thee: for much people are to me in this city.[11]And he sat a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.[12]And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews arose unanimously against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,[13]Saying, This one persuades men to worship God against the law.[14]And Paul being about to open the mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If therefore it were truly any injustice or wicked, criminal action, O Jews, against the word, I should have borne with you:[15]But if it is a question of the word, and names, and law, according to you, see ye yourselves; for I will not be judge of these.[16]And he drave them away from the judgment seat.[17]And all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, ruler of the synagogue, beat before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these.[18]And Paul yet having remained sufficient days, having taken leave of the brethren, sailed out to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn the head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.[19]And Paul arrived at Ephesus, and left those of his: and he having come into the synagogue, discussed with the Jews.[20]And they asking to remain with them for more time, he acquiesced not;[21]But he took leave of them, saying, I must at any rate do the coming festival in Jerusalem: and I will again return to you, God willing. And he was conveyed from Ephesus.[22]And having come down to Cesarea having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.[23]And having made a certain time, he came out, passing in order the Galatian country and Phrygia, supporting all the disciples.[24]And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, arrived at Ephesus, being able in the writings.[25]He was instructed in the way of the Lord; and boiling up in the spirit, he spake and taught attentively the things of the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.[26]And he began to speak freely in the synagogue: and Priscilla and Aquila having heard him, took him, and set forth to him the way of God more accurately.[27]And he wishing to pass through to Achaia, the brethren having encouraged, wrote to the disciples to receive him: who having arrived, profited much them having believed through grace:[28]For he mightily refuted the Jews publicly, shewing by the writings Jesus to be Christ.","Acts.19":"[1]And it was in Apollos’ being in Corinth, Paul having passed through the higher parts, came to Ephesus: and having found certain disciples,[2]He said to them, Having believed, have ye received the Holy Spirit? And they said to him, But neither heard we if there be a Holy Spirit.[3]And he said to them, Into what then were ye immersed? And they said, Into John’s immersion.[4]And Paul said, John truly immersed the immersion of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.[5]And they having heard, were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.[6]And Paul having laid hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.[7]And all the men were about twelve.[8]And having come into the synagogue, he spake freely, discoursing for three months, and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.[9]And when certain were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he separated the disciples, discoursing in the day in the school of a certain Tyrannus.[10]And this was for two years: so that all dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.[11]And God did special powers by Paul’s hands:[12]So that also upon the sick were brought from his body napkins or aprons, and diseases were removed from them, and evil spirits came out of them.[13]And certain of the wandering Jews, exorcists, undertook to call over them having evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.[14]And there were certain sons of Sceva, a Jew, chief priest, seven doing this.[15]And the evil spirit having answered, said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?[16]And the man leaping upon them in whom the evil spirit was, and having overpowered them, he was strong against them, so that naked and wounded they fled out of the house.[17]And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.[18]And many of them having believed came, acknowledging and proclaiming their deeds.[19]And sufficient of them having done unnecessary things, having brought books together, burned before all: and computed their prices, and found fifty thousand of silver.[20]Thus with might the word of the Lord increased, and was strong.[21]And when these were completed, Paul proposed in spirit, having passed through Macedonia and Achaia to go to Jerusalem, saying, That after have been there, I must also see Rome.[22]And having sent into Macedonia two of them serving him, Timothy, and Erastus, he stopped a season in Asia.[23]And in that time was there no little trouble about the way.[24]For a certain Demetrius by name, a silversmith, making the silver temples of Diana, furnished no little work to artificers;[25]Whom having collected together and the workmen of such things, he said, Men, ye know that out of this work is our good food.[26]And ye see and hear that not only Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, changed a sufficient crowd, saying, that they are not gods made by hands:[27]And not only this part is in danger to us to come to reproach; but also the temple of the great goddess Diana to be reckoned for nothing, and her greatness also about to be destroyed, whom the whole of Asia and the habitable globe worship.[28]And having heard, and been filled with wrath, they cried, saying, Great the Diana of the Ephesians.[29]And the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed unanimously into the theatre, having taken away together Gains and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul’s companions of the journey.[30]And Paul wishing to come in to the people, the disciples suffered him not.[31]And certain also of the chief of Asia, being friends to him, having sent to him, besought not to give himself into the theatre.[32]Others truly cried some other things: for the church was confused; and the most knew not for what they had come together.[33]And they forced Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews having put him forward. And Alexander having shaken the hand, wished to justify himself to the people.[34]And having known that he is a Jew, there was one voice from all crying for about two hours, Great the Diana of the Ephesians.[35]And the scribe having calmed the crowd, says, Men, Ephesians, for who is the man that knows not the city of the Ephesians, being temple keeper of the great goddess Diana, and sent by Jove?[36]Therefore these things not being refuted, it is necessary for you to be restrained, and to do nothing rash.[37]For ye brought these men not sacrilegious, nor blaspheming your goddess.[38]If truly therefore Demetrius, and the artificers with him, have a word against any, the court days are kept, and there are proconsuls; let them prosecute one another.[39]But if ye inquire anything concerning, other things, it shall be explained in a lawful assembly.[40]For we are also in danger to be called in question for this day, being no cause for which we shall be able to give back word of this confederation.[41]And having said these, he loosed the assembly.","Acts.20":"[1]And after the uproar was ceased, Paul having called the disciples, and greeted, he came out to go into Macedonia.[2]And having passed through those parts, and having besought them by much speech, he came into Greece.[3]And having made three months; an insidious plot having been for him by the Jews, being about to sail to Syria, there was a purpose to return through Macedonia.[4]And there agreed with him as far as Asia Sopater a Berean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus: and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.[5]These having come before awaited us in Troas.[6]And we sailed forth after the days of unleavened from Philippi, and came to them in Troas up to five days; where we tarried seven days.[7]And in one of the sabbaths, the disciples having been assembled together to break bread, Paul conversed with them being about to go forth the morrow; and he continued the word until midnight.[8]And sufficient lights were in the upper room, where they were assembled.[9]And a certain young man by name Eutychus, sitting in the window, borne down by deep sleep, Paul conversing more and more, fell down below from the third story, and was taken up dead.[10]And Paul having gone down, fell upon him, and embracing, said, Be not disturbed, for his soul is in him.[11]And having gone up, and broken bread, and tasted, and conversed for a sufficient time, till the light, so he went forth.[12]And they brought the child living, and were not little comforted.[13]And we having gone before to the ship, sailed to Assos, there being about to take up Paul: for so had he ordered, being about himself to go on foot.[14]And when he joined us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene.[15]And from thence having sailed away, the following day we arrived over against Chios; and the other day we approached to Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, the following day we came to Miletus.[16]For Paul determined to sail to Ephesus, as it might not be to him to spend the time in Asia: for he hastened, if it were possible to him, to be in Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.[17]And having sent from Miletus to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.[18]And when they came to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day in which I embarked for Asia, how I was with you all the time.[19]Serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, having happened to me by the insidious plots of the Jews:[20]How I concealed nothing of things profitable, not to announce to you, and teach you publicly, and in the houses,[21]Testifying to both Jews, and Greeks, repentance towards God, and the faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.[22]And now, behold, I, bound in the spirit, am going to Jerusalem, not knowing the things going to happen to me in it;[23]But that the Holy Spirit testifies in the city, saying that bonds and pressures await me.[24]But the word of none do I make mine own, neither have I my soul highly prized to myself, in order to finish my course with joy, and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the grace of God.[25]And now, behold, I know that all ye shall see my face no more, among whom I passed through, proclaiming the kingdom of God.[26]Wherefore I testify to you in this day, that I pure from the blood of all.[27]For I concealed not to announce to you all the counsel of God.[28]Attend therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit set you inspectors, to feed the church of God, which he acquired by his own blood.[29]For I know this, that there shall come in after my departure grievous wolves to you, not sparing the flock.[30]And of yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to tear away disciples after them.[31]Wherefore watch ye, remembering that the space of three years night and day I ceased not reminding each one with tears.[32]And now I commit you, brethren, to God, and to the word of his grace, being able to build up, and give you inheritance among all the consecrated.[33]Silver or gold, or clothing, of none have I eagerly desired.[34]And ye yourselves know, that to my necessities, and to those being with me, these hands served.[35]I shewed you all things, that so being wearied ye must support the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that himself said, It is happy to give rather than receive.[36]And having said these, having placed his knees, he prayed with them all.[37]And much weeping was from all; and having fallen upon Paul’s neck, they kissed him,[38]Grieving chiefly for the word which he spake, that they are about to see his face no more. And they sent him forward to the ship.","Acts.21":"[1]And it was, as we were conducted forth, torn asunder from them, having run straight forward, we came to Coos, and in continuation to Rhodes, and thence to Patara:[2]And having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having embarked, we were conducted forth.[3]And having been shown Cyprus, and left it at the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and were conveyed to Tyre: for thither was the ship discharging the lading.[4]And having found disciples, we remained there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.[5]And it was when we accomplished the days, having come out we went; all sending us forward, with wives and children, even to without the city: and having placed the knees upon the seashore, we prayed.[6]And having greeted one another, we embarked in the ship; and these returned to their own.[7]And we having finished the voyage from Tyre, arrived at Ptolemais, and having greeted the brethren, we remained one day with them.[8]And the morrow, they about Paul having come out, came to Cesarea: and having come to Philip’s house, bearer of good news, being of the seven, we remained with him.[9]And to him were four daughters, virgins, prophesying.[10]And we remaining many days, a certain prophet came down from Judea, by name Agabus.[11]And having come to us, and lifted up Paul’s girdle, and bound his hands and feet, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle, shall the Jews so bind in Jerusalem, and they shall deliver him into the hands of the nations.[12]And when we heard these things, both we, and the nations, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.[13]And Paul answered, What do ye weeping and breaking my heart? for I not only to be bound, but to die at Jerusalem, have prepared for the name of the Lord Jesus.[14]And he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.[15]And after these days, having packed up, we went up to Jerusalem.[16]And there came also with us of disciples from Cesarea, bringing with whom we should be received as guests to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an ancient disciple.[17]And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.[18]And the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.[19]And having greeted them, he recounted to each one what things God had done among the nations through his service.[20]And they having heard, honoured the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many ten thousands of Jews there are having believed: and all are zealous of the law:[21]And they were taught about thee, that thou teachest apostasy from Moses, all the Jews among the nations, saying, they are not to circumcise children, nor walk in the customs.[22]What is it therefore? the multitude must all come together: for they will hear that thou hast come.[23]Therefore do this which we say to thee: Four men are to us having a vow upon them;[24]Having taken these, be purified with them, and expend upon them, that they might shave the head: and all might know that what they are taught about thee is nothing; but thou proceedest in regular order, also thyself watching the law.[25]And of the nations having believed, we have written having judged them to keep nothing such, except to watch themselves from that sacrificed to idols, and blood, and strangulation, and harlotry.[26]Then Paul having taken the men, in the following day having been purified with them, went into the temple, announcing the completion of the days of purification, till an offering be brought for each one of them.[27]And when the seven days were about completed, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, embroiled all the crowd, and put hands upon them,[28]Crying out, Men, Israelites, help: This is the man, teaching all, everywhere, against the people, and the law, and this place: and yet also brought the Greeks into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.[29]For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.[30]And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people: and having taken up Paul, they drew him out of the temple: and quickly the doors were shut.[31]And seeking to kill him, a rumor went up to the captain of a thousand of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem had been embroiled.[32]Who having taken out of it the soldiers and centurions, he ran down to them: and they having seen the captain of a thousand and the soldiers, ceased striking Paul.[33]Then the captain of a thousand, having drawn near, took him, and commanded to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he might be, and what he had done.[34]And other cried what other in the crowd: and not being able to know certainly for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the camp.[35]And when he was upon the steps, it happened, he was borne by the soldiers for the violence of the crowd.[36]For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Take him away.[37]And being about to be brought into the camp, Paul says to the captain of a thousand, Is it lawful for me to speak anything to thee? and he said, Hast thou knowledge in Greek?[38]Art not thou then the Egyptian, who before these days having risen up, and having brought into the desert four thousand men of murderers?[39]And Paul said, I am truly a man a Jew, a Tarsean of Cilicia, a citizen of no undistinguished city: and I beseech of thee to give way for me to speak to the people.[40]And having given way, Paul standing upon the steps, shook with the hand to the people. And being much silence, he spake in the Hebrew dialect, saying,","Acts.22":"[1]Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence to you.[2](And having heard that he spake to them in Hebrew dialect, they held more silence: and he says,)[3]I am truly a Jew, a man born in Tarsus, of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the exactness of the fathers’ law, being zealous of God, as all ye are this day.[4]Who drove out this way even to death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women.[5]As also the chief priest testifies of me, and all the council of elders: and whose letters to the brethren having received, I went to Damascus, going to bring there the bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.[6]And it was to me going, and drawing near to Damascus about noon, suddenly much light from heaven flashed around me,[7]And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice, Saul, Saul, why drivest thou me out?[8]And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarite, whom thou drivest out.[9]And they being with me truly saw the light, and were terrified; but they heard not the voice of him speaking to me.[10]And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Having risen, go to Damascus; and there shall be told thee of all which has been arranged for thee to do.[11]And when I saw not from the glory of that light, led by the hand of them being with me I came to Damascus.[12]And a certain Ananias, a religious man according to the law, testified of by all the Jews dwelling,[13]Having come to me, and stood, said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And the same hour I looked up to him.[14]And he said, The God of our fathers took thee in hand, to know his will, and to see the Just, and hear the voice from his mouth.[15]For thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and hast heard.[16]And now what art thou about to do having risen, be immersed and wash away thy sins, having called upon the name of the Lord.[17]And it was to me returning to Jerusalem, and praying in the temple, I was in a deep trance:[18]And saw him saying to me, Hasten, and come quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony of me.[19]And I said, Lord, these know that I was imprisoning and skinning in the synagogues them believing on thee:[20]And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I myself was standing by, and assenting to his murder, and watching the garments of them murdering him.[21]And he said to me, Go: for I will send thee far off to the nations.[22]And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voices, saying, Take away such a one from the earth: for it is not suitable for him to live.[23]And they vociferating, and casting garments away, and throwing a cloud of dust into the air,[24]The captain of a thousand commanded him to be brought to the camp, having spoken to examine him by scourges; that he might know for what cause they exclaimed so against him.[25]And as he held him before with thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful to scourge a man a Roman, and uncondemned?[26]And the centurion having heard, having come near announced to the captain of a thousand, See what thou art about to do: for this man is a Roman.[27]And the captain of a thousand having come near, said to him, Tell me if thou art a Roman. And he said, Yes.[28]And the captain of a thousand answered, I obtained this citizenship for much capital. And Paul said, And I have been born.[29]Then quickly they about to examine him withdrew from him: and the captain of a thousand was afraid, knowing that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him.[30]And on the morrow, wishing to know the certainty that why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from bonds, and commanded the chief priests and the whole of their council to come, and having brought down Paul, he set him among them.","Acts.23":"[1]And Paul, having looked intently to the council, said, Men, brethren, I have lived as a citizen in all good conscience to God till this day.[2]And the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike his month.[3]Then said Paul to him, God is about to strike thee, thou wall covered with dust: and sittest thou judging me according to law, and commanded me to be struck illegally?[4]And they standing by said, Revilest thou God’s chief priest?[5]And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he is chief priest: for it has been written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.[6]And Paul having known that one part is of the Sadducees, and the other of the Pharisees, cried in the council, Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, son of a Pharisee: for the hope and rising up of the dead am I judged.[7]And he having spoken this, there was a dissension of the Pharisees and Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.[8]For truly the Sadducees say there is no rising up, neither messenger, nor spirit: and the Pharisees acknowledge both.[9]And there was a great cry: and the scribes of the Pharisees’ part, having risen, struggled with obstinacy, saying, We find nothing evil in this man: but if a spirit or messenger spake to him, we should not contend against God.[10]And there being much dissension, the captain of a thousand, having dreaded lest Paul be torn asunder by them, commanded the army, having gone down, to snatch him from the midst of them, and bring into the camp.[11]And the following night the Lord, having stood by him, said, Take courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou also testify at Rome.[12]And it being day, certain of the Jews having made a condition, anathematized themselves, saying, neither to eat or drink till they kill Paul.[13]And there were more than forty having made this conspiracy.[14]Who having come to the chief priests and elders, said, By an anathema, we anathematized ourselves, to taste of nothing till we kill Paul.[15]Now therefore do ye exhibit to the captain of a thousand, with the council, so that to-morrow he might bring him down to you, as about to examine more accurately the things concerning him: and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him.[16]And Paul’s sister’s son having heard of the ambuscade, having approached, and come into the camp, announced to Paul.[17]And Paul having called one of the centurions, said, Bring this young man to the captain of a thousand; for he has something to announce to him.[18]Then truly having taken him, he brought to the captain of a thousand, and says, Paul, the bound, having called me, asked to bring this young man to thee, having something to say to thee.[19]The captain of a thousand, having taken his hand, and having withdrawn in private, inquired, What is it which thou hast to announce to me?[20]And he said, That the Jews agreed together to ask thee, so that to-morrow thou mightest bring down Paul to the council, as about to inquire something more accurately about him.[21]Therefore thou shouldest not be persuaded by them: for more than forty men of them lie in wait for him, who anathematized themselves, neither to eat or drink till they should kill him: and now are they prepared, expecting a promise from thee.[22]Truly then the captain of a thousand discharged the young man, having enjoined him, Tell none that thou hast shown these things to me.[23]And having called two certain of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers, so that they go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred having held spears in the right hand, at the third hour of the night;[24]And to bring forward cattle to set Paul upon, that they might carry through safely to Felix the leader.[25]Having written a letter containing this type.[26]Claudius Lysias to the most excellent leader Felix, health.[27]This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them: having stood with an army, I took him away, having learned that he is a Roman.[28]And wishing to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down to this council:[29]Whom I found accused of questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or of bonds.[30]And the plot about to be by the Jews, having been made known to me against the man, for this I sent to thee, having also commanded the accusers to say things against him to thee. Farewell.[31]Then truly the soldiers according to that appointed them, having taken up Paul, brought by night to Antipatris.[32]And the morrow; having suffered the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the camp:[33]Who having come into Cesarea and given up the letter to the leader, they also placed Paul before him.[34]And the leader having read, and asked of what province he is, and having understood from Cilicia;[35]I will hearken to thee, he said, when also thine accusers should be present. And he commanded him to be watched in Herod’s pretorium.","Acts.24":"[1]And after five days the chief priest Ananias came down with the elders, and a certain orator, Tertullus, who exhibited to the leader against Paul.[2]And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,[3]Attaining much peace by thee, and good actions being to this nation by thy foresight altogether and everywhere, we accept, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.[4]And that I hinder thee no more, I beseech thee to hear us concisely by thy clemency.[5]For having found this man a scourge, and moving sedition to all Jews in the habitable globe, and standing in the first rank of the sect of Nazarites:[6]And who attempted to profane the temple: whom we also seized, and wished to judge according to our law.[8]Having commanded his accusers to come to thee: by which thou thyself shalt be able, having examined, to know of all these of which we accuse him.[9]And the Jews also agreed, saying, these things hold so.[10]And Paul answered, the leader having nodded to him to speak, Knowing from many years thee being judge to this nation, more cheerfully do I justify things concerning myself:[11]Thou being able to know that not more than twelve days are to me from which I went up, going to worship in Jerusalem.[12]And neither in the temple found they me discussing with any, or making a revolt of the crowd, neither in synagogues, nor in the city:[13]Nor can they bring me forward for things they now accuse me.[14]And this I confess to thee, that according to the way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things written in the law and the prophets:[15]Having hope to God, which they themselves also admit, a rising from the dead about to be, both of just and unjust.[16]And in this I myself attend carefully, to have a conscience unhurt towards God and men always.[17]And after many years I was present, going to do alms to my nation, and offerings.[18]In which they found me purified in the temple, not with the crowd, nor with uproar, and certain Jews from Asia.[19]Who ought to be present to thee, and accuse, if they have anything against me.[20]Or let these themselves say, if they found any injustice in me, I having stood before the council,[21]Or of this one voice, which I cried standing with them, That of the rising up of the dead I am judged this day by you.[22]And having heard these, Felix deferred them, knowing more accurately the things of the way, having said, When Lysias captain of a thousand shall come down, I will examine narrowly things concerning you.[23]And having appointed a centurion to keep Paul, and to have a setting at liberty, and to hinder none of his own to serve or come to him.[24]And after certain days, Felix, having been present with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, sent for Paul and heard him of the faith in Christ.[25]And he discoursing of justice, and temperance, and judgment about to be, Felix being terrified, answered, Having now, go; having taken time, I will recall thee.[26]And at the same time also hoping that money should be given him by Paul, so that he might loose him: wherefore also sending for him more frequently, he conversed with him.[27]And two years completed, Felix took Porcius Festus, a successor: and wishing to render a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.","Acts.25":"[1]Festus therefore having come to the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Cesarea.[2]And the chief priest and first of the Jews exhibited to him against Paul, and besought him,[3]Asking favor against him, that he might send for him to Jerusalem, making an ambuscade to kill him in the way.[4]Then truly answered Festus, Paul to be kept in Cesarea, and himself quickly about to go forth.[5]Therefore the able among you, he says, having gone down together, if there be anything in this man, let them accuse him.[6]And having tarried with them more than ten days, having gone down to Cesarea, on the morrow, having sat upon the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.[7]And he having come, the Jews having come down from Jerusalem stood round about, bringing many and heavy charges against Paul, which they could not prove.[8]He justifying himself, That neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I sinned any thing.[9]And Festus, wishing to render a favor to the Jews, having answered Paul, said, Wilt thou, having gone up to Jerusalem, there be judged by me of these things?[10]And Paul said, At Caesar’s judgment seat am I standing where I must he judged: I injured the Jews nothing, as thou also knowest better.[11]For if truly I act with injustice, and have done anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be nothing of which these accuse me, no one can yield me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.[12]Then Festus, having conversed with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar, to Caesar shalt thou go.[13]And certain days having intervened, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Cesarea, having saluted Festus.[14]And as they tarried there many days, Festus set up to the king the things of Paul, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:[15]About whom, I being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews exhibited, asking judgment against him.[16]To whom I answered, That it is not the custom to Romans to yield up any man to destruction, before that the accused may have the accusers before the face, and take place for defence for the accusation.[17]Therefore, they having come here together, having made no delay, in order having sat upon the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.[18]About whom the accusers, having stood up, brought no charge of what I supposed:[19]But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of a certain Jesus, having died, whom Paul declared living.[20]And I doubting at the question concerting this, said, If he be willing to go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.[21]And Paul having appealed for him to be kept for the determination of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I send him to Caesar.[22]And Agrippa said to Festus, I wished myself also to hear the man. And he said, Tomorrow thou shalt hear him.[23]Therefore the morrow, Agrippa having come, and Bernice, with much display, and having come into the hall, also with captains of thousands, and men of the city being in eminence, and Festus having commanded, Paul was brought.[24]And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men being present with us, ye behold this, of whom all the multitude of Jews addressed me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out he must no more live.[25]And I discovering nothing he has done worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Augustus, I judged to send him.[26]Of whom I have not anything certain to write to the lord. Wherefore I brought him to you, and especially to thee, king Agrippa, so that, examination having been, I should have some thing to write.[27]For it seems to me unreasonable sending one in bonds, and not to signify the charges against him.","Acts.26":"[1]And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul defended himself, having stretched out the hand:[2]Concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews, king Agrippa, I deem myself happy, being about to defend myself to thee this day:[3]Especially thee being judge of all the customs among the Jews, and also of the questions: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.[4]Therefore truly my manner of life from youth, having been from the beginning in my nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews know:[5]Knowing me beforehand, from a former period, if they would testify, that according to the most strict sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.[6]And now in the hope of the solemn promise having been made to the fathers by God, I stand, being judged,[7]To which our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to arrive. For which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews.[8]Why is it judged incredible by you, if God raise the dead?[9]I therefore truly thought to myself, I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, the Nazarite.[10]Which I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the holy ones I shut up in prison, having received authority from chief priests; and they taken up, I carried down a vote.[11]And in all the synagogues, many times punishing them, I compelled to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I drove out even also to cities without.[12]In which also going to Damascus with authority, and superintendence from the chief priests,[13]The middle of day, I saw in the way, O king, a light from heaven, above the brilliancy of the sun, having shone around me, and those going with me.[14]And we having all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why drivest thou me out? hard for thee to kick against goads.[15]And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou drivest out.[16]But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for, for this was I sent to thee, to take thee in hand, a servant and witness both of what things thou sawest, and of what I shall be seen to thee;[17]Taking thee away from people, and nations, to whom I now send thee.[18]To open their eyes, to turn them back from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, fur them to receive remission of sins, and inheritance with the consecrated by faith in me.[19]Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:[20]But to them in Damascus first, and Jerusalem, and all the country of Judea, and to the nations, announcing to change the mind, and to turn back to God, doing works worthy of change of mind.[21]For these things, me the Jews, having seized in the temple, attempted to kill with their own hands.[22]Therefore having obtained assistance from God, till this day do I stand, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses spake being about to be:[23]That Christ exposed to suffering, that first from the rising of the dead, he is about to announce light to the people, and nations.[24]And he defending himself by these, Festus said with a great voice, Thou art frenzied, Paul; many letters turn thee to madness.[25]And he says, I am not frenzied, most excellent Festus; but I speak the words of truth and soundness of mind.[26]For the king knows of these, to whom speaking freely I speak: for I am persuaded that none of these are unknown to him; for these were not done in a corner.[27]Believest thou the prophets, king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.[28]And Agrippa said to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to be a Christian.[29]And Paul said, I would pray to God also in little, and in much, not only thee, but also all hearing me this day to become such, of what kind I also am, besides these bonds.[30]And he having said these, the king arose, and the leader, and Bernice, and they sitting with them:[31]And having withdrawn, they spake to one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.[32]And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been loosed, if he had not appealed to Caesar.","Acts.27":"[1]And when it was determined for us to sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain others bound to a centurion named Julius, of Augustus’ band.[2]And having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, being about to navigate places in Asia, we were conveyed; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.[3]And another day we were brought down to Sidon. And Julius having treated Paul affectionately, gave him up, having gone to his friends to obtain care.[4]And conveyed from thence, we sailed to Cyprus, for the winds were contrary.[5]And having sailed over the sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra, of Lycia.[6]And there the centurion having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, placed us upon it.[7]And in many days sailing slowly, and with difficulty having come to Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete, to Salmone;[8]And, with difficulty sailing by it, we came to a certain place called The fair havens; to which the city Lasea was near.[9]And a suitable time having intervened, and sailing being already dangerous, for the fast had already passed by, Paul advised,[10]Saying to them, Men, I see that with violence and much damage, not only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives, the voyage is about to be.[11]But the centurion was rather persuaded by the pilot and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.[12]And the harbor being not suitable for passing the winter, the greater part took counsel to be conveyed from thence, if perhaps having arrived at Phenice, they may be able to pass the winter; a harbor of Crete, looking to the south west and to the country.[13]And the south wind having blown softly, having thought to have obtained the purpose, hoisting up near, they sailed by Crete.[14]And after not much a violent wind struck against it, called Enroclydon.[15]And the ship having been caught, and not able to resist the wind, yielding we were carried away.[16]And having run under a certain island called Clauda, with difficulty were we able to be commanding the boat:[17]Which having taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing lest they might fall through into the quicksand, having loosened the vessel, so were they borne away.[18]And we being exceedingly tempest tossed, the following day they made a casting of the cargo overboard;[19]And the third, working with our bands, we cast out the rigging of the ship.[20]And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small tempest impending, finally all hope for us to be saved was removed.[21]And there being much abstinence from food, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, Truly it was fitting, O men, having obeyed me, not to be conveyed from Crete, and gain this violence and damage.[22]And now I advise you to be cheerful: for there shall be no throwing away of soul from you, but of the ship.[23]For the messenger of God stood by me in this night, whose I am, and whom I serve,[24]Saying, Fear not, Paul; Thou must stand before Caesar: and, behold, God has bestowed on thee as a gift all these sailing with thee.[25]Wherefore, O men, be cheerful: for I believe God, that so it shall be as he has spoken to me.[26]But we must fall upon a certain island.[27]And when it was the fourteenth night, we being carried up and down in Adria, at midnight the sailors supposed some country brought near them;[28]And having sounded, they found twenty fathoms; and having removed a little, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms.[29]And fearing lest perhaps we might fall through into rough places, having cast four anchors from the stern, prayed for day to come.[30]And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having loosened the boat to the sea, for a pretext as about to extend the anchors from the prow,[31]Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these should remain in the ship, ye cannot be saved.[32]Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off.[33]And till it was about to be day, Paul besought all to take food, saying, Awaiting this day the fourteenth day, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing.[34]Wherefore I beseech you to take food: for this is for your salvation: for not a hair of the head of one of you shall fall.[35]And having said these, and having taken bread, he returned thanks to God before all: and having broken, he began to eat.[36]And all being cheerful, these also received food.[37]And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.[38]And satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.[39]And when it was day, they knew not the land: and they observed a certain deep bay having a coast, into which they resolved, if able, to push the ship.[40]And having in removed the anchors, they let go into the sea, at the same time having let loose the bonds of the rudders, and having lifted up the mizen mast, they held with the blast to the coast.[41]And having fallen into a place between two seas, they caused the ship to strike; and truly the prow, fixed firmly, remained undisturbed, but the stern was loosed by force of the waves.[42]And the soldiers’ counsel was that they kill the prisoners, lest any, having swum away, may escape.[43]But the centurion wishing to save Paul, hindered from the resolution; and he commanded those being able to swim, having cast off first, to come to land:[44]And the rest, truly some on boards, and some on certain things from the ship. And so it was, all were saved upon the land.","Acts.28":"[1]And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita.[2]And the foreigners bestowed upon us no ordinary kindness: for having lighted a pile of wood, they received us all on account of the impending rain, and for the cold.[3]And Paul having collected together a multitude of dried sticks, and placed upon the pile of wood, a viper, having come forth out of the heat, seized his hand.[4]And when the foreigners saw the wild beast hanging on his hand, they said to one another, This man is altogether a murderer, whom, saved from the sea, vengeance suffered not to live.[5]Who truly then, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered nothing evil.[6]And they expected him about to be inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly: and they waiting for much, and seeing nothing extraordinary coming to him, changing their opinions, they said he was a god.[7]And with them about that place was landed property to the first of the island, by name Publius; who having received us, lodged us with friendship three days.[8]And it was the father of Publius lay, held fast with fever and dysentery: to whom Paul, having come in and prayed, laid hands upon him, and healed him.[9]Then this done, the rest having sicknesses in the island, came near, and were cured:[10]And they honoured us with many honours; and to us getting under weigh, they set things for need.[11]And after three months we were conveyed in a ship, having wintered in the island, of Alexandria, marked, Sons of Jove.[12]And brought down to Syracuse, we tarried yet three days longer.[13]Whence having come round, we arrived at Rhegium: and after one day the south wind having come up, we came the second day to Puteoli:[14]Where having found brethren, we were besought by them to tarry yet seven days longer: and so we came to Rome.[15]And thence the brethren, having heard of us, came out to our meeting as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom Paul having seen, having returned thanks to God, took courage.[16]And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander of the camp: but to Paul it was permitted to remain by himself with a soldier watching him.[17]And it was after three days Paul called together them being first of the Jews: and they having come together, he said to them, Men, brethren, I having done nothing against the people, or customs of the fathers, I was delivered in bonds from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.[18]Who, having examined me, wished to loose, for no cause of death was in me.[19]And the Jews saying against, I was forced to appeal to Caesar; as having nothing to accuse my nation.[20]For this cause therefore I besought to see you, and to speak: for, for the hope of Israel am I surrounded by this chain.[21]And they said to him, We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor any of the brethren having been present announced or spoke any evil of thee.[22]And we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest: for truly of this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.[23]And having appointed him a day, many came to him to the lodging; to whom testifying, he set forth the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morn to eve.[24]And some truly were persuaded by things spoken, and some disbelieved.[25]And being at variance with one another, they were let go, Paul having said one word, That well spake the Holy Spirit by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,[26]Saying, Go to this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and ye should not perceive:[27]For the heart of this people was thickened, and with ears heard they heavily, and their eyes they closed; lest they should see with the eyes, and with ears should hear, and with the heart they should understand, and turn back, and I should heal them.[28]Be it known to you therefore, that salvation of God was sent to the nations, and they shall hear.[30]And Paul remained two whole years in his own wages, and received all going to him,[31]Proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, unimpeded.","Rom.1":"[1]Paul, servant of Jesus Christ, called sent, separated to the good news of God,[2](Which he before promised by his prophets in the holy writings,)[3]Concerning his Son born of the seed of David according to the flesh.[4]Determined the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the rising up of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord:[5]By whom we received grace and sending forth, to the obedience of faith in all nations for his name:[6]In whom are ye also, the called of Jesus Christ:[7]To all being in Rome, beloved of God, called holy: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.[8]First, I return thanks to my God by Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is announced in the whole world.[9]For my witness is God, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, so that continually I make mention of you, always supplicating in my prayers;[10]If in any way I shall be prospered on my way in the will of God to come to you.[11]For I long to see you, That I might impart to you some spiritual grace, in order for you to be firm;[12]And this is, to be comforted together in you by the faith in one another both of you and of me.[13]And I would not ye should be ignorant, brethren, that many times I proposed to come to you, (and I was hindered till this time,) that I might have some fruit also in you, and in the rest of the nations.[14]Both to Greeks, and foreigners; both to wise and unwise, I am debtor.[15]So that for my part being zealous, also to you that in Rome, to announce the good news.[16]For I am not ashamed of the good news of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to all believing; both to the Jew first, and the Greek.[17]For the justice of God in it is revealed from faith to faith: as has been written, And the just shall live by faith.[18]For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all profanation and injustice of men, of those detaining the truth in injustice;[19]Wherefore that known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested to them.[20]For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world, being understood by things made, are inspected, truly both his eternal power and divinity; so that they are inexcusable:[21]Wherefore having known God, not as God did they honour or return thanks; but were rendered vain in their conversations, and their heart without understanding was darkened.[22]Declaring themselves to be wise, they were fools,[23]And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of creeping things, and of quadrupeds.[24]Wherefore God delivered them in the eager desire of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies in themselves:[25]Who changed the truth of God into a falsehood, and reverenced and served the creation above him creating, who is praised forever. Amen.[26]Therefore God delivered them to the suffering of ignominy: for also their females changed the natural use into that against generation:[27]Likewise also males, leaving the natural use of the female, were set on fire in their longing for one another; males with males working deformity, and the retribution which was needed receiving in themselves for their erring.[28]And as they chose not to have God in knowledge, God delivered them to an adulterated purpose, to do things not fitting;[29]Having been filled with all injustice, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, badness; full of envy, slaughter, strife, deceit, malignity,[30]Whisperers, slanderers, odious to God, abusers of power, proud, tumultuous, inventors of injuries, disobedient to parents,[31]Destitute of understanding, unsteady, devoid of natural affection, implacable, merciless:[32]Who knowing the justice of God, that they doing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also approve those doing.","Rom.2":"[1]Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one judging: for in what thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou judging doest the same.[2]And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon them doing such things.[3]And thinkest thou this, O man, judging them doing such things, and doing the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?[4]Or the abundance of his goodness and forbearance and long suffering dost thou despise; not knowing that the goodness of God brings thee to repentance?[5]And according to thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest up to thyself anger in the day of anger and revelation of the just judgment of God;[6]Who will give back to each according to his works:[7]To them truly by perseverance of the good work they seek glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:[8]But to them of intrigue, and are truly disobedient to the truth, and yielding to injustice, anger and wrath,[9]Affliction and distress, upon every soul of man working evil, both of the Jew first, and of the Greek;[10]But glory, and honour, and peace, to every one working good, both to the Jew first, and to the Greek:[11]For there is no distinction of persons with God.[12]For as many as sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;[13](For not hearers of the law just with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.[14]For when nations, not having the things of the law, by nature do the things of the law, these, not having the law, are law to themselves:[15]Which show the work of the law Written in their hearts, their consciousness testifying together, and between one another thoughts accusing or also excusing;)[16]In the day when God shall judge the concealed things of men according to my good news by Jesus Christ.[17]Behold, thou art named a Jew, and restest upon the law, and boastest thyself in God,[18]And knowest the will, and triest things differing, being sounded out of the law;[19]And art persuaded thou thyself to be a guide of the blind, a light of them in darkness,[20]An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the inexperienced, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.[21]Therefore teaching another, teachest thou not thyself proclaiming not to steal, stealest thou?[22]Speaking not to commit adultery, committest thou adultery? abhorring images, committest thou sacrilege?[23]Thou who boastest in the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest thou God?[24]For the name of God by you is blasphemed in the nations, as it has been written.[25]For truly circumcision profits, if thou do the law: and if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision has become uncircumcision.[26]Therefore if uncircumcision watch the justification of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?[27]And shall not uncircumcision by nature, completing the law, judge thee, which by letter and circumcision a transgressor of the law?[28]For he in appearance, is not a Jew; neither circumcision, in appearance in the flesh:[29]But he in concealment, a Jew; and circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose approbation not of man, but of God.","Rom.3":"[1]What then the superiority of the Jew or what the advantage of circumcision?[2]Much according to every manner: for truly first were they trusted with the oracles of God.[3]For what if some disbelieved? their unbelief will not leave inactive the faith of God.[4]It may not be: and let God be true, and every man a liar; as has been written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest conquer in thy being judged.[5]And if our injustice shall recommend the justice of God, what shall we say God not unjust bringing in anger? (I speak as man).[6]It may not be: for how shall God judge the world.[7]For if the truth of God in my lying abounded to his glory; why yet am I judged as sinful?[8]And not, (as we are defamed, and some have declared us to say,) That we should do evil things, that good things might come: whose judgment is just.[9]What advantage therefore have we? Not in any way: for we before accused both Jews and Greeks, all to be under sin.[10]As has been written, That there is no just one, not one:[11]There is none understanding, there is none seeking God.[12]All have bent aside, together have they become unprofitable: there is none doing good, there is not even one.[13]Their throat an opened tomb; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps under their lips:[14]Whose mouth is full of cursing and harshness:[15]Their feet active to pour out blood:[16]Bruising and grievous toil in their ways:[17]And the way of peace they knew not:[18]The fear of God is not before their eyes.[19]And we know that whatever says the law, it speaks to them in the law: that every mouth be shut, and all the world be culpable to God.[20]Therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified before him: for by the law the knowledge of sin.[21]But now without law the justice of God has been made apparent, being testified by the law and by the prophets;[22]And the justice of God by faith of Jesus Christ to all and upon all believing: for there is no distinction:[23]For all have sinned, and failed of the glory of God;[24]Being justified as a gift by his grace by the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:[25]Whom God had set before a propitiatory by faith in his blood, for a manifestation of his justice by passing over of sins before existing, in the sufferance of God;[26]For the manifestation of his justice now in time: for him to be just, and justifying him of the faith of Jesus.[27]Where then boasting? It was excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.[28]We reckon then man to be justified by faith without the works of the law.[29]Or only the God of the Jews? and not also of the nations? Yes, also of the nations:[30]Since one God, who will justify circumcision of faith, and uncircumcision by faith.[31]Therefore shall we leave the law inactive by faith It may not be: but we should establish the law.","Rom.4":"[1]What then shall we say Abraham our father to have found, according to the flesh?[2]For if Abraham was justified by works, he has boasting; but not toward God.[3]For what says the writing? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.[4]And to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to favor, but according to debt.[5]And to him not working, and believing upon him justifying the impious, his faith is reckoned for justice.[6]As also David speaks the happiness of the man, to whom God reckons justice without works,[7]Happy they whose iniquities were remitted, and whose sins were covered.[8]A happy man to whom the Lord should not reckon sin.[9]This happiness then upon circumcision, or upon uncircumcision? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for justice.[10]How then was it reckoned? to him being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.[11]And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which in uncircumcision: for him to be father of all believing through uncircumcision; for justice also to be reckoned to them:[12]And father of circumcision to them not of circumcision only, but also to them, walking in order in the tracks of the uncircumcision, of the faith of our father Abraham.[13]For not by the law, the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, for him to be heir of the world, but by the justice of faith.[14]For if they of the law, heirs, faith was made void, and the promise left inactive:[15]For the law works wrath: for where is no law, no transgression.[16]Therefore of faith, that according to grace; the promise to be firm to all the seed; not to that of the law only, but also to that of the faith of Abraham; who is father of us all,[17](As it has been written, That have set thee father of many nations,) over against him who believed God, making alive the dead, and calling things not being as being.[18]Who against hope believed upon hope, for him to become father of many nations, according to that said, So shall thy seed be.[19]And not having been weak in faith, he observed not his own body already having been dead, being about a hundred years, and the death of Sarah’s womb:[20]And for the promise of God he was not separated by unbelief; but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God;[21]And made perfectly certain that, what was promised, he is able to do.[22]And therefore it was reckoned to him for justice.[23]And it was not written for him alone, that it was reckoned to him;[24]But also for us, to whom it is about to be reckoned, to them believing upon him having raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;[25]Who was delivered up for our faults, and raised up for our justification.","Rom.5":"[1]Justified therefore of faith we have peace with God by our Lord Jesus Christ:[2]By whom also we have had access by faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast upon hope of the glory of God.[3]And not only, but also we boast in affliction: knowing that affliction works perseverance;[4]And perseverance, proof; and proof, hope.[5]And hope shames not; for the love of God has been poured in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given us.[6]For yet Christ, we being weak, Recording to the time died for the impious.[7]For scarcely for the just will any one die: yet for the good perhaps some also would venture to die.[8]And God recommends his own love to us, that we yet being sinful, Christ died for us.[9]Much more then, justified now in his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.[10]For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.[11]And not only, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.[12]Therefore, as by one man sin came into the world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned:[13](For until the law sin was in the world: and sin is not charged, being no law.[14]But death reigned from Adam to Moses, and upon them not having sinned upon the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is the type of him about to be.[15]But not as the fall, so also the favor. For if for the fall of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace, of one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.[16]And not as by one having sinned, the gift: for truly the judgment of one to condemnation, but the favor of many falls to justification.[17]For if by the fall of one, death reigned by one; much more they receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of justice in life shall reign by one, Jesus Christ.)[18]Therefore as by the fall of one for all men to condemnation; so also by the justification of one for all men to justification of life.[19]For as by one man’s disobedience many were constituted sinful, so also by the obedience of one shall many be constituted just.[20]And the law entered, that the fall might abound. And where sin abounded, grace superabounded:[21]That as sin reigned in death, so grace might reign by justice to life eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.","Rom.6":"[1]What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that grace might abound.[2]It may not be. We who died to sin, shall we yet live in it?[3]Or know ye not, that as many of us as were immersed in Christ Jesus, we were immersed into his death?[4]Therefore were we buried with him by immersion into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.[5]For if grown together we have been in the likeness of his death, but also shall we be of the resurrection:[6]Knowing this, that our old man was crucified together, that the body of sin might be left inactive, for us no more to serve sin.[7]For he having died was justified from sin.[8]And if we died with Christ, we believe we shall also live with him:[9]Knowing that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more power over him.[10]For he who died, died to sin once: but he who lives, lives to God.[11]So also ye reckon yourselves truly to be dead to sin, and living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.[12]Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to listen to it in its passions.[13]Neither present ye your members weapons of injustice to sin: but present yourselves to God, as living from the dead, and your members weapons of justice to God.[14]For sin shall not rule over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.[15]What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace It may not be.[16]Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience, ye are servants to whom ye listen; either of sin to death, or of obedience to justice?[17]And grace to God, that ye were servants of sin, but ye listened from the heart to the type of teaching in which ye were delivered.[18]And freed from sin, ye were subdued to justice.[19](I speak as man through the weakness of your flesh:) for as ye presented your members to uncleanness and iniquity; so now present ye your members servants to justice for consecration.[20]For when ye were servants to sin, ye were free to justice.[21]Therefore what fruit had ye then of what ye are now ashamed? for the end of these, death.[22]And now freed from sin, and subdued to God, ye have your fruit to consecration, and the end life eternal.[23]For the purchasing the provisions of sin, death; and the grace of God, life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord.","Rom.7":"[1]Know ye not brethren, (for I speak to them knowing law,) that law rules over man as much time as he lives?[2]For a married woman is bound by the law to a living husband; and if the husband die, she is left inactive from the law of the husband.[3]Wherefore, the husband living, she shall be called adulteress if she be to another man: but if the man die, she is free from the law; not to be an adulteress, being to another man.[4]Therefore, my brethren, ye also were dead to the law by the body of Christ; for you not to be to another, but to him raised from the dead, that we bring forth fruit to God.[5]For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, those by the law, were energetic in our members to bring forth fruit to death.[6]And now we were left inactive from the law, having died in what we were held; so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.[7]What then shall we say? The law sin? It may not be. But I knew not sin except by the law: for I knew not lust, if the law said not, Thou shalt not eagerly desire.[8]And sin, having taken occasion by the command, wrought in me every lust. For without law sin dead.[9]And I was living without law once: and the command having come, sin came back to life, and I died.[10]And the command was found to me which for life, this for death.[11]For sin having taken occasion by the command, deceived me completely, and by it killed me.[12]Therefore truly the law holy, and the command holy, and just, and good.[13]Was then good death to me? It may not be. But sin, that it might appear sin, by the good working death in me; that sin might be sinful to excess by the command.[14]For we know that the law is spiritual: and I am fleshly, sold under sin.[15]For what I work I know not: for what I would not, this I do; but what I hate, this I do.[16]And if what I would not this I do, I consent to the law that it is good.[17]And now I no more wish it, but sin dwelling in me.[18]For I know that in me dwells no good, (that is, in my flesh:) for to will lies near me; but to work good I find not.[19]For not what good I would, do I; but the evil I would not, this I do.[20]And if what I would not, this I do, I no more work it, but sin dwelling in me.[21]I find therefore a law to me, wishing to do good, that evil lies near me.[22]For I rejoice in the law of God, according to the man within:[23]And I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and taking me captive to the law of sin being in my members.[24]What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?[25]I return thanks to God by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore truly with the mind I serve the law of God; and with the flesh the law of sin.","Rom.8":"[1]Therefore now no condemnation to them in Christ Jesus, walking not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.[2]For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus freed me from the law of sin and death.[3]For the impossibility of the law, in that it was weak by the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:[4]That the justification of the law be filled up in us, not walking according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.[5]For they being according to the flesh mind things of the flesh; and they according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.[6]For the thought of the flesh, death; and the thought of the Spirit, life and peace.[7]Wherefore the thought of the flesh enmity to God: for it is not subject to the law of God, for it cannot be.[8]And they being in the flesh cannot please God.[9]But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwell in you. And if any have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.[10]And if Christ in you, truly the body dead by sin; and the Spirit life by justice.[11]And if the Spirit of him having raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he having raised up Christ from the dead will make alive also your mortal bodies by his Spirit dwelling in you.[12]Therefore, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.[13]For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: and if by the Spirit ye kill the deeds of the body, ye shall live.[14]For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.[15]For ye have not received the Spirit of servitude again for fear; but have received the Spirit of adoption as a son, in which we cry, Abba, Father.[16]The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are children of God:[17]And if children, also heirs; truly heirs of God, and coheirs of Christ; if indeed we suffer together, that we may be also glorified together.[18]For I reckon that the sufferings of the time now not worthy of the glory about to be revealed in us.[19]For the anxious expectation of the creation awaits the revelation of the sons of God.[20]For the creation was subject to vanity, not voluntarily, but by him having subjected in hope,[21]That also the creation itself be freed from servitude of corruption to the freedom of the glory of the children of God.[22]For we know that all creation groans together and travails together until now.[23]And not only, but also they having the first fruits of the Spirit, and we ourselves groan in ourselves, waiting for the adoption as a son, the redemption of our body.[24]For by hope were we saved: but hope being seen is not hope: for what any one sees, why does he also hope?[25]And if what we see not, we hope for, by patience we wait.[26]And likewise also the Spirit takes hold together, and assists our weaknesses: for what we would pray for as we ought, we know not, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.[27]And he searching hearts knows what the thought of the Spirit, for according to God he supplicates for the holy ones.[28]And we know that to them loving God, all things work together for good, to them being called according to the setting up.[29]For whom he before knew, he also before determined of the form of the image of his Son, for him to be first born in many brethren.[30]And whom he before determined, these he also called: and whom he called, these he also justified: and whom he justified, these he also glorified.[31]What then shall we say to these? if God with us, who against us?[32]Who truly spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, and how not with him will he freely give us all?[33]Who shall demand payment for the chosen of God? God justifying.[34]Who, he condemning Christ having died, and rather also raised again, who is at the right hand of God, and who intercedes for us.[35]Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? pressure, or perplexity, or expulsion, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?[36]As has been written, That for thy sake we are killed the whole day; we were reckoned as sheep for slaughter.[37]But in all these we obtain a complete victory by him having loved us.[38]For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor beginnings, nor powers, nor things having stood, nor things about to be,[39]Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.","Rom.9":"[1]I Speak truth in Christ, I lie not, my consciousness bearing witness to me in the Holy Spirit,[2]That there is great grief to me and continued pain in my heart.[3]For I myself was praying to be anathema from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:[4]Who are Israelites; whose the adoption as a son, and the glory, and covenants, and legislation, and divine worship, and solemn promises;[5]Whose the fathers, and from whom Christ according to the flesh, who being God over all, praised forever. Amen.[6]And not as that the word of God has fallen through. For not they all of Israel, they which of Israel:[7]Neither that the seed of Abraham, are all children: but, In Isaac shall the seed be called to thee.[8]That is, The children of the flesh, these not the children of God: but the children of the solemn promise are reckoned for seed.[9]For this the word of solemn promise, According to this time will I come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.[10]And not only; but also Rebecca, having coition of one, Isaac our father;[11](For not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that according to choice the purpose of God might remain, not of works, but of him calling;)[12]It was said to her, That the greater shall serve the less.[13]As has been written, Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated.[14]What then shall we say is injustice with God? It may not be.[15]I will commiserate whomsoever I commiserate, and I will have compassion upon whomsoever I have compassion.[16]Surely then, not of him willing, nor of him running, but of God commiserating.[17]For the writing says to Pharaoh, That for this same have I raised thee up, so that I might show in thee my power, and so that my name might be announced in all the earth.[18]Surely then, whom he will he commiserates, and whom he will he hardens.[19]Thou wilt then say to me, Why does he yet blame For who has withstood his will?[20]Surely, O man, who art thou replying against God? Shall the formation say to him having formed, Why hast thou made me so.[21]Or has not the potter power over the clay, of the same mixture truly to make one vessel for honour, and one for dishonour.[22]And if God, willing anger to be shown, and his power to be made known, endured in much long suffering the vessels of anger put in proper order for destruction:[23]And that he might make known the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy, which he before prepared for glory.[24]Whom he also called us, not only from the Jews, but also of the nations?[25]As also he says in Hosea, I will call not my people my people; and the not loved, loved.[26]And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, Ye not my people; there shall they be called the sons of the living God.[27]And Esaias cries for Israel, If the number of the sons of Israel as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:[28]For finishing and cutting short the word in justice: for the Lord will make the word cut short upon the earth.[29]And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us seed, as Sodom had we been, and as Gomorrha had we been likened.[30]What then shall we say? That the nations, not following justice, overtook justice, and the justice of faith.[31]And Israel following the law of justice, reached not the law of justice.[32]Wherefore? Because not of faith, but as of the works of the law. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone;[33]As has been written, Behold I set in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and every one believing on him shall not be ashamed.","Rom.10":"[1]Brethren, truly my heart’s delight and prayer to God for Israel is for salvation.[2]For I testify for them that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.[3]For not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish their own justice, they have not been subjected to the justice of God.[4]For Christ the end of the law for justice to every one believing.[5]For Moses writes the justice of the law, That the man having done these things shall live in them.[6]And the justice of faith says thus, Thou shouldest not say in thy heart, Who shall go up to heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)[7]Or, Who shall go down to the abyss? (that is, to bring up Christ from the dead.)[8]But what does it say? The word is near thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim;[9]For if thou confess in thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.[10]For with the heart is believed for justice: and with the mouth is confessed for salvation.[11]For the writing says, Every one believing upon him shall not be ashamed.[12]For no distinction is of the Jew and also of the Greek: for the same Lord of all being rich to all calling upon him.[13]For every one whoever should call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.[14]How then shall they call upon whom they believed not? and how shall they believe whom they heard not? and how shall they hear without him proclaiming?[15]And how shall they proclaim, except they be sent? as has been written, How beautiful the feet of them announcing good news, peace, of them announcing good things![16]But not all listened to the good news. For Esaias says, Lord, who believed our report?[17]Therefore faith, from the report, and report by the word of God.[18]But I say, Have they not heard? Surely, in all the earth went out their sound, and their words to the end of the habitable globe.[19]But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will make you jealous of not a nation, and by a shortsighted nation will I anger you.[20]And Esaias is very confident, and says, I was found of them not seeking me; I was manifested to them not asking for me.[21]And to Israel he says, The whole day have I unfolded my hands to an unbelieving and contradicting people.","Rom.11":"[1]I say then, Has God rejected his people It may not be. For I also am an Israelite, of Abraham’s seed, of the tribe of Benjamin.[2]God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.

And if of works, it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.[7]What then What Israel seeks for, this be attained not; but the selection attained, and the rest were hardened.[8](As has been written, God gave them the spirit of mortal pain, eyes not to see, and earn not to hear;) even to this day.[9]And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for booty, and for a stumblingblock, and for a retribution to them:[10]Let their eyes be darkened not to see, and let them bend their back always.[11]I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? It may not be: but by their fall salvation to the nations, to make them jealous.[12]And if their fall the riches of the world, and their disaster the riches of the nations; how much more their fulness?[13](For I speak to you the nations, inasmuch as truly I am the sent of the nations, I highly value my service:[14]If in some way I might make jealous my flesh, and I might save some of them.)[15]For if their rejection the reconciliation of the world, what the reception, but life from the dead?[16]And if the first fruit holy, also the mixture: and if the root holy, also the young shoots.[17]And if certain of the young shoots were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in them, and wert a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree;[18]Act not proudly to the young shoots.

And such shall have pressure to the flesh: and I spare you.[29]And this I say, brethren, the time is restricted; as to the rest, that they also having wives should be as not having;[30]And they weeping, as not weeping; and they rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and they buying, as not possessing.[31]And they using this world, as not using; for the form of this world passes away.[32]But I will you to be free from care. The unmarried cares for things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord:[33]And he married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.[34]The wife and virgin have been divided. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she might be holy also in body and spirit: and she married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.[35]And this I say for the advantage of yourselves; not that I shall cast a net upon you, but for the becoming, and occupied assiduously for the Lord without being turned away.[36]And if any think to act unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she be past the vigor of youth, and so it ought to be, let him do what he will, he sins not; let them marry.[37]And he who has stood firmly fixed in heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his virgin, does well.[38]So that he marrying does well; and he not marrying does better.[39]The woman was bound by law for as much time as her husband lives; and if her husband be set to sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.[40]And she is happier if she so remain, according to my opinion: and I also think to have the Spirit of God.","1Cor.8":"[1]And concerning sacrifice to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, and love builds the house.[2]And if any one thinks to know anything, as yet he has known nothing as he ought to know.[3]And if any one love God, the same is known of him.)[4]Concerning food therefore of sacrifices to idols, we know that an idol nothing in the world, and that none other God but one.[5]For also though they are called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon the earth, (for there are many gods, and many lords,)[6]But to us one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all things, and we by him.[7]But not in all, knowledge: and some with consciousness of the idol even till now eat as a sacrifice to idols: and their consciousness being weak is contaminated.[8]And food sets us not before God: for neither, if we eat, do we abound; neither if we eat not, do we want.[9]And see ye lest this your power be a stumble to the weak.[10]For if any one see thee having knowledge reclining in the idol’s temple, shall not his consciousness, being weak, be built up to eat the sacrifices to idols;[11]And shall the weak brother be destroyed upon thy knowledge, for whom Christ died?[12]And so sinning against the brethren, and striking their weak consciousness, ye sin against Christ.[13]Wherefore, if food offend my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, lest I shall offend my brother.","1Cor.9":"[1]Am I not sent? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord.[2]If to others I am not sent, but surely I am to you: for the seal of my sending are ye in the Lord.[3]My justification to them examining me is this,[4]have we not power to eat and to drink?[5]Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife; as also the rest of the sent, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?[6]Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power not to work?[7]Who makes war at any time at his own charges who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?[8]Not according to man do I speak these things: or does not the law also say these things?[9]For in the law of Moses has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox grinding. Is there not care to God for oxen?[10]Or does he say altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us: that he ploughing ought to plough upon hope; and he grinding upon hope, to participate with his hope.[11]If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it great if we shall reap your carnal things?[12]If others participate with your power, not rather we? But we used not this power; but endure all things, lest we give some hindrance to the good news of Christ.[13]Do ye not know that they working consecrated things, eat of the temple? they working diligently at the altar, share together with the altar?[14]Thus also the Lord appointed to them announcing good news to live of the good news.[15]But I used none of these things: and I wrote not these things, that thus it might be with me: for good to me rather to die, than that any should render my boasting void.[16]For if I announce the good news, there is no boasting to me: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I announce not the good news![17]For if of free will I do this, I have reward: and if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.[18]What reward therefore is to me? That announcing good news, I shall make the good news of Christ not expensive, not to make use of my power in the good news.[19]For being free from all, I have subjected myself to all, that I might gain the more.[20]And I was to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them under the law;[21]To the lawless, as lawless, (not being lawless to God, but subject to the law to Christ,) that I might gain the lawless,[22]I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have been all things to all, that altogether I might save some.[23]And this I do on account of the good news, that I might become a partaker of it.[24]Do ye not know that they running in a race-course, all truly run, and one receives the prize of combat? Do ye so run, that ye might receive.[25]And every one contending for the prize, has self command in all things. These surely therefore that they might receive a corruptible crown; and we an incorruptible.[26]I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so practise I pugilism, as not laying stripes upon air:[27]But I give my body a blow under the eyes, and reduce to bondage: lest having proclaimed to others, I myself be rejected.","1Cor.10":"[1]And I will not ye be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;[2]And were all immersed into Moses in the cloud, and in the sea;[3]And they all ate the same spiritual food.[4]And all drank the same spiritual drink: for they drank of the spiritual Rock following; and the Rock was Christ.[5]But God was not contented with the most of them: for they were overthrown in the desert.[6]And these things were our types, that we be not eagerly desirous of evil things, as they also eagerly desired.[7]Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as has been written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.[8]Neither should we commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand.[9]Neither should we tempt Christ, as also some of them tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.[10]Neither do ye murmur, as also some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.[11]And all those happened types to them; and it was written for our reminding, to whom the ends of the times have arrived.[12]Therefore let him seeming to stand see that he fall not.[13]No temptation except human has taken you and God faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but with the temptation will he also make an escape, that ye may be able to bear.[14]Wherefore, my beloved, do ye flee from idolatry.[15]As to the wise speak I; judge ye what I say.[16]The cup of praise which we praise, is it not the mutual participation of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the mutual participation of the body of Christ?[17]That, one bread, one body, we are many: for we all partake of one bread.[18]See ye Israel according to the flesh: are not they eating the sacrifices mutual participators of the altar?[19]What do I say therefore? that an idol is any thing? or that what is sacrificed to an idol is any thing?[20]But, that what things they sacrifice the nations sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I will not ye be partakers of demons.[21]Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and the table of demons.[22]Do we emulate the Lord? are we stronger than he?[23]All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all things are lawful to me, but all build not the house.[24]Let none seek his own, but each another’s.[25]Every thing being sold in the market, eat, ye, interrogating nothing through consciousness:[26]For of the Lord the earth, and its fulness.[27]And if any one of the unbelieving call you, and ye wish to go; every thing set before you, eat, interrogating nothing through consciousness.[28]And if any one say to you, This is sacrificed to an idol, eat not, for him making it known, and consciousness: for of the Lord the earth, and its fulness:[29]And consciousness, I say, not thine, but another’s: for that why is my freedom judged by another’s consciousness.[30]And if I partake by grace, why am I defamed for what I give thanks?[31]Whether therefore ye eat, whether ye drink, or what ye do, do ye all things to the glory of God.[32]And be ye not molesters to the Jews, and the Greeks, and to the church of God:[33]As I also please in all things to all, not seeking my advantage, but that of many, that they might be saved.","1Cor.11":"[1]Be ye imitators of me, as I also of Christ.[2]And I approve you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and as I have delivered to you, do ye hold the traditions.[3]And I will you to know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman the man; and the head of Christ God.[4]Every man praying or prophesying, having on the head, shames his head.[5]And every woman praying or prophesying with head uncovered shames her head: for it is one and the same to her having been shaved.[6]For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: and if shameful to the woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.[7]For truly the man ought not to have the head covered, being the image and glory of God: and the woman is the glory of the man.[8]For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.[9]For also the man was not created through the woman; but the woman through the man.[10]Therefore the woman ought to have power upon the head for the angels.[11]But neither the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.[12]For as the woman by the man, so also the man by the woman; and all things of God.[13]Judge in yourselves: is it suitable for a woman to pray to God uncovered?[14]Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man truly have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?[15]And if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for the hair has been given her for a cloak.[16]And if any one seem to be loving strife, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.[17]And this announcing I approve not, that not for the better come ye together, but for the worse.[18]For truly first, ye coming together in the church, I hear divisions to be among you; and some part I believe.[19]For there must be also sects among you, that the tried might be made manifest among you.[20]Therefore ye coming together upon the same, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper.[21]For each takes his own supper in eating: and one is truly hungry, and one is intoxicated.[22]For, have ye not houses for eating and drinking? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them not having? What should I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise not.[23]For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, in the night which he was delivered up, took bread:[24]And having given thanks, he brake, and said, Take ye, eat; this is my body, broken for you: this do ye for my remembrance.[25]Likewise the cup also, after supping, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink, for my remembrance.[26]For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye announce the Lord’s death till he come.[27]Therefore whoever should eat this bread, and drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be liable to the penalty of the body and blood of the Lord.[28]And let a man try himself, and so eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.[29]For he eating and drinking unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.[30]For this many among you weak and sick, and enough are asleep.[31]For if we examined ourselves, we should not be judged.[32]And being judged, we are corrected of the Lord, lest we be condemned with the world.[33]Therefore, my brethren, coming together to eat, succeed one another.[34]And if any hunger, let him eat in the house; lest ye come together for judgment. And the rest when I come I will regulate.","1Cor.12":"[1]And concerning spiritual things, brethren, I wish you not to be ignorant.[2]Ye know that ye were the nations, to dumb idols, as ye were led, being carried away.[3]Wherefore I make known to you, that none speaking in the Spirit of God calls Jesus anathema: and none can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit.[4]And there are distinctions of favors, and the same Spirit.[5]And there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord.[6]And there are distinctions of performances, and it is the same God performing all things in all.[7]And to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.[8]For truly to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;[9]And to another faith in the same Spirit; and to another graces of healings in the same Spirit;[10]And to another performances of powers; and to another discriminations of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:[11]And all these works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each his own things as be will.[12]For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, is one body: so also is Christ.[13]For also in one Spirit were we all immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or free; and we have all been given to drink into one Spirit.[14]For also the body is not one member, but many.[15]If the foot say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.[16]And if the ear say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.[17]If the whole body an eye, where the hearing If the whole hearing, where the smelling?[18]And now has God set the members each one of them in the body, as he would.[19]And if all were one member, where the body.[20]And now truly many members, and one body.[21]The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.[22]But much rather the members of the body, seeming to be weak, are necessary:[23]And what we think to be less honourable of the body, upon these we put more abundant honour; and our unseemly parts have more abundant decorum.[24]And our becoming parts have no need: but God blended the body together, to the wanting having given more abundant honour:[25]That no division be in the body; but the members should care the same for one another.[26]And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer together; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.[27]And ye are the body of Christ, and members by parts.[28]And whom truly God set in the church, first the sent, second the prophets, third teachers, then powers, then graces of healings, helps, directions, kinds of tongues.[29]Not all sent: not all prophets: not all teachers: not all powers:[30]All have not the favors of healing: not all speaking with tongues: not all interpret accurately.[31]And be emulous of the better favors: and yet I shew you a way according to eminence.","1Cor.13":"[1]If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I have been the brass of echoes, and the shouting cymbal.[2]And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.[3]And if I feed out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.[4]Love is slow to anger, possesses kindness; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,[5]It demeans itself not unbecomingly, seeks not the things of itself, is not irritated, reckons no evil;[6]Rejoices not at injustice, and rejoices with the truth;[7]Covers all things, believes all, hopes all things, endures all.[8]Love never falters: but whether gifts of prophecies, they shall be left unemployed; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall be left unemployed.[9]For we know by parts, and we prophesy by parts.[10]And when the perfected come, then shall that by parts be left unemployed.[11]When I was a child, as a child I spake, as a child I thought, as a child I reckoned: and when I had become a man, I left unemployed the things of a child.[12]For now we see by a mirror in an enigma; then face to face: now I know by parts; and then shall I know as I was known.[13]And now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greater of these, love.","1Cor.14":"[1]Pursue love, and be emulous of spiritual things, and rather that ye might prophesy.[2]For he speaking in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God: (for none hears; and in the spirit he speaks mysteries.)[3]And he prophesying speaks to men for building the house, and entreaty, and encouragement.[4]And he speaking in a tongue builds himself; and he prophesying builds the church.[5]And I will ye all to speak with tongues, and rather that ye prophesy; for greater he prophesying, than he speaking with tongues, unless he interpret accurately, that the church receive building up.[6]And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?[7]As inanimate things giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if it give not a distinction to sounds, how shall the piping or harping be known?[8]For also if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?[9]So also ye, except by the tongue ye give an evident word, how shall the speaking be known? for ye shall be speaking into the air.[10]If perchance, such kind of voices be in the world, and none of them speechless.[11]If therefore I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him speaking a foreigner, and he speaking a foreigner to me.[12]So also ye, since ye are zealous of spirits, for the building up of the church seek that ye may abound.[13]Wherefore he speaking in a tongue, let, him pray that he might interpret.[14]For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, and my mind is unfruitful.[15]What therefore is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind: I will play on the harp in the spirit, and I will play also on the harp in the mind.[16]When if thou praise in the spirit, how shall he filling the place of the private individual say Amen at thy thanksgiving) since he knows not what thou sayest.[17]For thou truly givest thanks well, but the other is not built up.[18]I thank my God, speaking in tongues more than you all:[19]But in the church, I will to speak five words by my mind, that I might also sound in the ears of others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.[20]Brethren, be not children in reflection: but in wickedness act like children, and in reflection be ye perfected.[21]It has been written in the law, That in other tongues and in other lips will I speak to this people; and not so will they hear me, says the Lord.[22]So that tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving: and the gift of prophecy, not to the unbelieving, but to the believing.[23]If therefore the whole church come together upon the same, and all speak with tongues, and the private individual, or unbelieving, come in, will they not say that ye are enraged?[24]And If all prophesy, and any unbelieving, or ignorant private individual come in, he is refuted by all, he is examined by all:[25]And so the hidden things of his heart are made manifest; and so having fallen upon the face, he will worship God, proclaiming that God is truly with you.[26]Therefore, what is it brethren when ye come together, every one of you has a Psalms, has teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretatior. Let all things be for the building of the house.[27]Whether any speak in a tongue, by two, or the most by three, and in part; and let one interpret.[28]And if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.[29]And let the prophets speak two or three, and let others decide.[30]And if to another sitting by it be revealed, let the first be silent.[31]For ye are all able to prophesy one by one, that all might learn, and all might be encouraged.[32]And the spirits of the prophets are subjected to the prophets.[33]For God is not of unsteadiness, but of peace, as in all the churches of the holy ones.[34]Let your women be silent in the churches: for it has not been committed to them to speak; but to be subjected, as also says the law.[35]And if they will learn anything, let them ask their own husbands in the house; for it is shameful for women to speak in the church.[36]Or came out the word of God from you or did it arrive to you only?[37]If any think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him observe what I write to you, that they are the commands of the Lord.[38]And if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.[39]Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and hinder not to speak in tongues.[40]Let all things be becomingly and according to order.","1Cor.15":"[1]And I make known to you, brethren, the good news which I announced to you, which also ye received, and in which ye stood;[2]By which also ye are saved, to which word I announced to you if ye hold, unless ye believed to no purpose.[3]For I delivered to you among the first, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the writings;[4]And that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day, according to the writings.[5]And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:[6]Then was he seen by above five hundred brethren once for all; of whom the most remain till now, and some also are laid to rest.[7]Then was he seen by James; then by all the sent.[8]And last of all exactly as an abortive, was he also seen by me.[9]For I am the least of the sent, who am not fit to be called sent, for I drove out the church of God.[10]And by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which in me was not vain; but I was more abundantly wearied than they all: and not I, but the grace of God which with me.[11]Whether therefore I or they, so we proclaim, and so ye believed.[12]And if Christ is proclaimed that he arose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no rising up of the dead?[13]And if there is no rising up of the dead, neither has Christ risen:[14]And if Christ has not risen, then our proclaiming vain, and also your faith vain.[15]And we are also found false witnesses of God; for we testified for God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not, if therefore the dead are not raised.[16]For if the dead are not raised, neither was Christ raised up:[17]And if Christ was not raised up, your faith is vain; yet are ye in your sins.[18]Then they also having died in Christ perished.[19]If in this life only we have been hoping in Christ, we are more to be compassionated than all men.[20]And now Was Christ raised from the dead, he was the first fruits of those having died.[21]For since by man death, also by man the rising up of the dead.[22]For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.[23]And each in his own order: the first fruit Christ; then they of Christ in his arrival.[24]Then the end, when he should deliver up the kingdom to God, and the Father; when he should leave unemployed every beginning and every authority and power.[25]For he must reign, till he put all enemies under his feet.[26]The last enemy, death, is left unemployed.[27]For he subjected all things under his feet. And when he said that all things have been subjected, it is manifest that without him having subjected all things to him.[28]And when all things be subjected to him, then also shall the Son himself be subjected to him having made all things subject to him, that God might be all things in all.[29]For what shall they do being immersed for the dead, if in fine the dead rise not? and why are they immersed for the dead?[30]And why are we in peril every hour?[31]In the day I die by: your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.[32]If according to man I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what the profit to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.[33]Be not deceived: evil intercourses corrupt good habits.[34]Recover your senses rightly, and in not; for some have a want of knowledge of God: I speak to your confusion.[35]But some one will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?[36]Froth, what thou sowest is not made alive, except it die:[37]And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body going to be, but the naked kernel, if perhaps of wheat, or some of the rest:[38]And God gives it a body as he would, and to each of the seed its own body.[39]Not all flesh the same flesh: but one truly flesh of men, and another of cattle, and another of fishes, and another of flying things.[40]And celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but truly one the glory of the celestial, and another that of the terrestrial.[41]One glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differs from star in glory.[42]So also the rising up of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:[43]It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:[44]It is sown an animated body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animated body, and there is a spiritual body.[45]So also has been written, The first man Adam was born into a living soul; and the last Adam into a spirit making alive.[46]But the first not spiritual, but animated; then the spiritual.[47]The first man of earth, made of earth: the second man the Lord from heaven.[48]As the made of earth, such also the made of earth: and as the celestial, such also the celestial.[49]And as we have borne the image of the made of earth, we shall also bear the image of the celestial.[50]And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.[51]Behold, I speak to you a mystery; We truly shall not all be laid asleep, but we shall all be changed,[52]In an atom, in the twinkling of the eye, in the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.[53]For this corrupted must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.[54]And when this corrupted shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, then shall be the word written, Death was swallowed down in victory.[55]Where thine, death, the sting? where thine, hades, the victory.[56]And the sting of death sin; and the power of sin the law.[57]And grace to God, giving us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.[58]Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stable, unmoved, abounding in the work of the Lord always, knowing that our fatigue is not in vain in the Lord.","1Cor.16":"[1]And concerning the collection for the holy ones, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.[2]According to one day of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, treasuring up that which he is prospered in, that when I come there be no collections.[3]And when I be present, whom ye approve by letters, these will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.[4]And if it be suitable for me also to go, they shall go with me.[5]And I will come to you, when I pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.[6]And perhaps with you I shall abide, or also pass the winter, that ye might send me forward wherever I go.[7]For I will not see you now in coming forward; but I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord permit.[8]And I will remain in Ephesus even till Pentecost.[9]For a door has stood open to me, great and effective, and many opposed.[10]And if Timotheus come, see ye that he be with you fearlessly: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also.[11]Therefore no one should despise him: and send ye him forward in peace, that he might come to me: for I expect him with the brethren.[12]And concerning Apollos, the brother, I besought him much that he would come to you with the brethren: and the will was not altogether that he should come now; and he will come when he should have leisure.[13]Watch ye, stand in the faith, be manly, be strengthened.[14]Let all things be in love.[15]And I beseech you brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and they arranged themselves for service to the holy ones,)[16]That also ye be subjected to such, and to every one cooperating, and to the wearied.[17]And I rejoice at the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and: that they have filled up your necessity.[18]For they refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore observe ye such.[19]The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church at their house, greet you.[20]All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.[21]The greeting of Paul by my hand.[22]If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.[23]The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with you:[24]My love with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.","2Cor.1":"[1]Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and brother Timothy, to the church of God being in Corinth, with all holy ones being in the whole of Achaia:[2]Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.[3]Praised the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion, and God of all comfort:[4]Who comforting us upon all our pressure, that we may be able to comfort them in every pressure, by the comfort by which we ourselves are comforted by God.[5]For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so by Christ abounds also our comfort.[6]And whether we are pressed, for your comfort and salvation, being well wrought in endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer: whether we are comforted, for your comfort and salvation.[7]And our hope firm for you, knowing, that as ye are participators of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.[8]For we wish you not to be ignorant, brethren, of our pressure having been to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly loaded, above strength, so that we were in utter perplexity even to live:[9]And we ourselves have had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have trusted in ourselves, but in God raising the dead:[10]Who saved us from so great a death, and does save: in whom we have hoped also that he will yet save;[11]And ye serving together for us in prayer, that of many faces, the favor to us by many thanks be returned by us.[12]For our boasting is this, the testimony of our consciousness, that in simplicity and purity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we turned back in the world, and more eminently to you.[13]For we write no others to you, but what ye either know or also observe; and I hope that also even to the end ye will observe;[14]As also ye observed us by part, that we are your boast, as also ye ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.[15]And in this confidence I wished to come to you before, that ye might have a second grace;[16]And by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia, to come to you, and by you to be sent forward to Judea.[17]Therefore I resolved this, much less did I use levity: or what I resolve, do I resolve according to the flesh, that there be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay.[18]And God faithful, for our word to you was not yea or nay.[19]For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who proclaimed in you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but was yea in him.[20]Forasmuch as the solemn promises of God in him yea, and in him Amen, for glory to God by us.[21]And he making us firm with you in Christ, and having anointed us, is God;[22]Who also having sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.[23]And I call upon God a witness upon my soul, that, sparing you, I came no more to Corinth.[24]Not that we are masters of your faith, but we are aiders of your joy: for ye have stood in the faith.","2Cor.2":"[1]And I determined this to myself, not to come to you again in sadness.[2]For if I grieve you, and who is he making me glad, except he being grieved by me.[3]And I wrote this same to you lest, coming, I should have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, trusting to you all, that mine is the joy of you all.[4]For out of much pressure and anxiety of heart I wrote to you through many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love I have more abundantly towards you.[5]And if any have grieved, he has not grieved me, but by part; that I might not overload you all.[6]Sufficient to such a one this enjoyment of the esteem of the many.[7]So that on the contrary ye should rather show kindness, and console, lest perhaps such be swallowed down with more abundant sadness.[8]Wherefore I beseech you to confirm love to him.[9]For, for this I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if ye are obedient for all things.[10]And to whom ye show any favor; I also: for also if I have shown any kindness, to whom I have shown kindness, through you in the face of Christ;[11]That we might not be taken advantage of by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his inventions.[12]And coming to Troas for the good news of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,[13]I have had no relaxation to my spirit, in my not finding Titus my brother: but having taken leave of them, I went out to Macedonia.[14]Grace to God, always leading us to triumph in Christ, and making manifest the order of his knowledge by us in every place.[15]For we are to God a sweet odor of Christ, in the saved, and in the host:[16]Truly to those an odor of death into death; and to those an odor of life into life. And who sufficient for these things?[17]For we are not as the many adulterating the word of God: but as of purity, but as of God, before the face of God speak we in Christ.","2Cor.3":"[1]Begin we again to recommend ourselves or need we not, as some; recommendatory epistles to you, or recommendatory from you?[2]Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and acknowledged by all men:[3]Made manifest that ye are the epistle of Christ served by us, not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables made of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.[4]And we have such confidence through Christ to God:[5]Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency of God;[6]Who rendered as fitting servants of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, and the Spirit makes alive.[7]And if the service of death, in letters imprinted in stones, was in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently to the face of Moses for the glory of his face; being left unemployed.[8]How shall not rather the service of the Spirit be in glory?[9]For if the service of condemnation glory, much more the service of justice abounds in glory.[10]For also that having been glorified has not been glorified in this part, for sake of the glory excelling.[11]For if that left unemployed by glory, much more that remaining in glory.[12]Therefore having such hope, we use much freedom of speech:[13]And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel should not look intently to the end of that left unemployed:[14]But their minds were hardened: for until this day the same veil upon the reading of the old covenant remains not uncovered; for in Christ it is left unemployed.[15]But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.[16]And whenever it turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.[17]And the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord, there freedom.[18]And we all, shown as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, with the face uncovered, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Spirit of the Lord.","2Cor.4":"[1]For this, having this service, as we were compassionated, we lose not courage;[2]But have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craft, neither adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves to every consciousness of man before God.[3]And if also our good news is hid, in the lost is it hid:[4]In whom the God of this world blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the enlightening of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, does not enlighten them.[5]For we don’t preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake;[6]For God, having spoken light to shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts, to the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.[7]And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the eminence of power be of God, and not of us.[8]Being pressed in every thing, but not straightened; being at a loss, but not utterly perplexed;[9]Being driven out, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not destroyed;[10]Always bearing about in the body the death of the Lord Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our body.[11]For we, the living, are always delivered to death for Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our mortal flesh.[12]So that death is truly energetic in us, and life in you.[13]And having the same spirit of faith, according to that written, I believed, therefore I spake: and we believe, and therefore we speak;[14]Knowing that he having raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us by Jesus, and present us with you.[15]For all things for you, that grace, having abounded by the many, might abound in thanksgiving to the glory of God.[16]Wherefore we lose not courage; but if also our man without is destroyed, but he within is renewed day and day.[17]For the present moment the lightness of our pressure works to us an eternal weight of glory, as eminence upon eminence;[18]We looking not at things seen, but at things not seen: for things seen, temporary; and things not seen, eternal.","2Cor.5":"[1]For we know that if our earthly house of the tent were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.[2]For also in this we groan, longing to have our dwelling from heaven put on:[3]If also being even clothed we shall not be found naked.[4]For also being in the tent we groan, being loaded: since we wish not to be unclothed, but to be clothed, that the mortal should be swallowed up of life.[5]And he having brought us about to this same, God, he having also given us the pledge of the Spirit.[6]Therefore being always confident, and knowing that, being at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:[7](For we walk by faith, and not by external appearance:)[8]And we are confident, and are contented rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home in the Lord.[9]Wherefore also let us seek the honour, whether being at home, whether being absent, to be pleasing to him.[10]For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ; that each might receive the things for the body, for what he did, good or bad.[11]Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; and we are made manifest to God; and I hope also to have been made manifest to your consciences.[12]For not again do we recommend ourselves to you, but giving you occasion for boasting over us, that ye might have for them boasting in face, and not in heart.[13]For whether we be beside ourselves, to God: or be of sound mind, to you.[14]For the love of Christ holds us together; having judged this, that if one died for all, then all dead:[15]And he died for all, that the living no more live to themselves, but to him having died for them, and having risen.[16]So that we from now know none according to the flesh: and if also we have known Christ according to the flesh, but now we know no more.[17]So that if any in Christ, a new creation: old things have passed away; behold, all have become new.[18]And all things of God, having reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and given us the service of reconciliation;[19]For as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their faults; and having set in us the word of reconciliation.[20]For Christ therefore are we ambassadors, as of God beseeching by us: we pray for the sake of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.[21]For him not knowing sin, he made sin for us; that we might be the justice of God in him.","2Cor.6":"[1]And working together, we also beseech, lest also ye receive the grace of God in vain.[2](For he says, In an acceptable time I listened to thee, and in the day of salvation have I run to succor thee: behold, now the acceptable time; behold; now the day of salvation.)[3]Giving no offence in any thing, that the service be not blamed:[4]But in every thing recommending ourselves as servants of God, in much patience, in pressures, in necessities, in extremities,[5]In blows, in imprisonments, in disorders, in fatigues, in watchings, in fastings;[6]In purity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned.[7]In the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of justice of the right hands and the left,[8]Through glory and ignominy, through slander and applause: as erring, and true;[9]As being ignorant, and knowing; as dying, and, behold, we live; as being disciplined, and not killed;[10]As being grieved, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.[11]Our month stands open to you, O Corinthians, our heart has been enlarged.[12]Ye are not contracted in us, but ye are contracted in your bowels.[13]And for the same recompense, (I speak as to children,) be ye yourselves also enlarged.[14]Be not unequally yoked together with the unbelieving: for what participation to justice and iniquity and what communion to light with darkness?[15]And what conformity to Christ with Belial? and what part to the believing with the unbelieving?[16]And what agreement to the temple of God with images? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God said, That I will dwell in them, and will go round about; and will be their God, and they shall be a people to me.[17]Therefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you.[18]And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.","2Cor.7":"[1]Therefore having these declarations, dearly let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.[2]Receive us; we injured none, we corrupted none, we took advantage of none.[3]I speak not to condemnation: for I have said before, ye are in our hearts to die together, and live together.[4]Much freedom of speech to me toward you; to me much boasting over you: I am filled with consolation, I superabound in joy in all your pressure.[5]For also, we having come to Macedonia, our flesh had no relaxation, but pressed in everything; without conflicts, within fears.[6]But God, comforting the humble, comforted us in the arrival of Titus;[7]And not only in his arrival, but also in the comfort which he was comforted in you, announcing to us your anxious desire, your lamentations, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.[8]For if I also grieved you in the epistle, I regret not, and if I did regret: for I see that that epistle, if also for a time, grieved you.[9]Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved to repentance: for ye were grieved according to God, that ye be injured in nothing by us.[10]For grief according to God works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but grief of the world works death.[11]For behold, this same that ye grieve according to God, what care it wrought in you, but defence, but indignation, but fear, but anxious desire, but zeal, but punishing! In every thing ye recommended yourselves to be holy in this affair.[12]Wherefore, if I also wrote to you, not for him having been unjust, for him having suffered injustice, but that your care for us might be made manifest to you before God.[13]Therefore have we been comforted in your comfort: and we rejoiced more abundantly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed from you all.[14]For if I have boasted anything to him of you, I was not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so also was our boasting over Titus the truth.[15]And his bowels are more abundantly to you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and tremor ye received him.[16]I rejoice that I place confidence in you in everything.","2Cor.8":"[1]And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God given in the churches of Macedonia;[2]That in much proof of pressure the abundance of their joy and their poverty according to depth abounded to the abundance of their simplicity.[3]For according to power, I testify, and above power chosen voluntarily;[4]Praying us with much entreaty that we receive the grace and participation of the service for saints.[5]And not as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.[6]So that we besought Titus, that as he began before, so also he would complete to us this grace also.[7]But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all care, and in love from you to us, that also ye abound in this grace.[8]I speak not according to command, but by care of others, trying also the purity of your love.[9]For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for you he was in a state of beggary, being rich; that ye in his poverty might be rich.[10]And in this I give an opinion: for this is profitable to you, which no only to do, but to will, ye began before from last year.[11]And now also complete ye the doing; that as a forwardness to will so also to complete, out of what is possessed.[12]For if a forwardness lie before, according as any has, it is acceptable, not as he has not.[13]For not that ease to others, and pressure to you:[14]But of equality, now in this time your abundance for their want, that also their abundance be for your want: that there be equality:[15]As has been written, He to whom much, was not in excess; and he to whom little, was not diminished.[16]And grace to God, having given the same care for you in the heart of Titus.[17]For truly he received the entreaty; and being more earnest, he went forth voluntarily to you.[18]And we sent with him the brother whose approbation in the good news through all the churches;[19]And not only, but also the hand stretched out by the churches for our fellow-traveler with this grace, served by us to the glory of the same Lord, and to your forwardness:[20]Prepared for this, lest any blame us in this abundance served by us:[21]Providing good things beforehand, not only before the Lord, but also before men.[22]And we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many things being earnest many times, and now much more earnest, with much confidence in you.[23]Whether for Titus, my companion and co-worker to you: or our brethren, the sent of the churches, the glory of Christ.[24]Therefore the manifestations of your love, and of your boasting for us, shew ye to them, and to the face of the churches.","2Cor.9":"[1]For truly, concerning the service to the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write to you:[2]For I know your forwardness, which I boast of for you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from last year; and zeal from you excited the many more.[3]And I sent the brethren, lest our boasting for you be empty in this part; that, as I said, ye might be prepared:[4]Lest if in some way the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed, (that we should not say, ye) in this principle of boasting.[5]Therefore I thought necessary to beseech the brethren that they go before to you, and prepare beforehand your praise, having been proclaimed beforehand, this same to be prepared, so as praise, and not as covetousness.[6]And this, He sowing sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he sowing in praises shall reap also in praises.[7]Each as he chooses in the heart; not of grief, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.[8]And God able for all grace to abound in you; having always all sufficiency in everything, ye abound in every good work:[9](As has been written, He scattered; he gave to the poor: his justice remains forever.[10]And now he furnishing seed to him sowing, and bread for food, furnish and multiply your sowing-season, and increase the fruits of your justice;)[11]Enriched in everything in all simplicity, which works through us gratitude to God.[12]For the service of this office is not only filling up the wants of the saints, but also abounding through many thanks to God;[13]By the proof of this service honouring God for the subjection of your assent to the good news of Christ, and to the simplicity of mutual participation to them and to all;[14]And by their prayer for you, longing for you through the exceeding grace of God upon you.[15]And grace to God for his indescribable gift.","2Cor.10":"[1]And I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and equity of Christ, who, in face truly low with you, but at a distance bold towards you:[2]And I pray, being present, not to be bold with the confidence which I reckon to encounter against certain, reckoning us as walking about according to the flesh.[3]For walking in the flesh, we war not after the flesh:[4](For the weapons of our warfare not fleshly, but powerful to God to the taking down of fortified places;)[5]Taking down reckonings, and every elevation lifted up against the knowledge of God, and taking captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;[6]And having in readiness to avenge every imperfect instruction, when your obedience should be completed.[7]See ye things according to the face? If any has persuaded himself to be of Christ, let him reckon this again of himself, that, as he of Christ, so we also of Christ.[8]For if I also boast something more abundantly of our power, which the Lord gave us for the building up, and not for your taking down, I shall not be ashamed:[9]Lest I seem as terrifying you by epistles.[10](For truly the epistles, he says, weighty and strong; but the presence of the body weak, and the word counted as nothing.)[11]Let such a one reckon this, that, such as we are in the word by the epistles, being away, such also, being present, in deed.[12]For we dare not appear or join ourselves to certain of them recommending themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and joining themselves to themselves, do not understand.[13]And we boast not of things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure divided to us, to reach even also to you.[14]For not as reaching to you we stretch beyond ourselves: for also even to you we came before in the good news of Christ:[15]Not boasting in things immeasurable, in the toils of others; and having hope, your faith being increased, to be enlarged in you according to our rule for abundance,[16]To announce the good hews in things beyond you, not in another’s rule to boast for things prepared.[17]But he boasting, let him boast in the Lord.[18]For not he recommending himself, this is acceptable, but whom the Lord recommends.","2Cor.11":"[1]I would ye hold me up a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.[2]For I am zealous of you with the zeal of God: for I fitted you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.[3]And I am afraid lest, as the serpent completely deceived Eve in his craft, so your thoughts be corrupted from the simplicity which in Christ.[4]For if he coming proclaim another Jesus, which I proclaimed not, or ye receive another spirit, which ye received not, or other good news, which ye received not, ye have held up well.[5]For I reckon myself to be nothing greatly inferior to the sent.[6]And, if also ignorant in the word, but not in knowledge; but in every thing, we having been made manifest in all for you.[7]Or did I a sin, humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I announced to you the good news of God gratuitously?[8]I stripped other churches, having received pay, for your service.[9]And being present with you, and having wanted, I acted not with negligence to any: (for the brethren having come from Macedonia filled up still more my want:) and I kept myself in every thing not burdensome to you, and I will keep.[10]The truth of Christ is in me, for this boasting shall not be shut up in me in the regions of Achaia.[11]Wherefore? because I love you not? God knows.[12]And what I do, and I will do, that I shall not cut off the occasion of those wishing the occasion; that in what they boast, they be found as also we.[13]For such the falsely sent, crafty workers, being transformed into the sent of Christ.[14]And not wonderful; for Satan himself is transformed into a messenger of light.[15]No great thing therefore if also his servants are transformed as servants of justice; whose end shall be according to their works.[16]Again I say, lest any one should think me to be mad; and if not so indeed, as mad do ye receive me that I might also boast myself some little.[17]What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in madness, in this first principle of boasting.[18]Since many boast according to the flesh, I shall also boast.[19]For ye bear with the mad willingly, being wise.[20]For ye bear, if any reduce you to bondage, if any devour, if any receive, if any be lifted up, if any skin you on the face.[21]I speak according to dishonour, as that we were weak. And in what any dares, (I speak in rashness,) I dare also.[22]Are they Hebrews? I also. Are they Israelites? I also. Are they Abraham’s seed? I also.[23]Are they Christ’s servants? (I speak being light-headed) I above; in toils more abundant, in blows more excessively, in watchings more abundantly, in deaths often.[24]Of the Jews five times I received forty, except one.[25]Thrice was I scourged with rods, once was I stoned, thrice suffered I shipwreck, I have made a night and day in the deep;[26]In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers of the family, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in solitude, in dangers in the sea, in dangers with false brethren;[27]In fatigue and toil, in watchfulnesses often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.[28]Besides things outside, my distraction daily, the care of all the churches.[29]Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I am not inflamed.[30]If I must boast, I will boast things of my weakness.[31]God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ knows, he being praised forever, that I lie not.[32]In Damascus king Aretas’ governor watched the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me.[33]And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and I escaped from his hands.","2Cor.12":"[1]Indeed it is not profitable to me to boast. For I will come to visions and Revelation of the Lord.[2]I knew a man in Christ before fourteen years, (whether in the body, I know not; whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;) such a one having been carried off even to the third heaven.[3]And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;)[4]That he was carried off into paradise, and heard words not to be told, which it was not permitted man to speak.[5]Of such a one will I boast: and of myself I will not boast, except in my weakness.[6]For if I be willing to boast, I shall not be mad; for the truth will I say: and I spare, lest any reckon for me above what he sees me, or what he hears of me.[7]And lest I be lifted up by the eminence of Revelation, a thorn in the flesh was given me, a messenger of Satan, that he might cuff me, lest I be lifted up.[8]For this thrice besought I the Lord, that it remove away from me.[9]And he said to me, My grace suffices thee: for my power is perfected in weakness. Therefore very willingly will I boast rather in my weaknesses, that Christ’s power may lodge upon me.[10]Therefore am I contented in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities in expulsions, in extremities for Christ: for when I am weak, then am I strong.[11]I have been mad boasting; ye forced me: for I ought to have been recommended by you: for I was not greatly inferior to the sent, if also I am nothing.[12]Surely the signs of one sent was wrought in you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and powers.[13]For what is it which ye were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself acted not with negligence to you? favor me for this injustice.[14]Behold, I have prepared to come to you the third time; and I will not act with negligence to you: for I seek not your things, but you: for children ought not to treasure up for parents, but parents for children.[15]And I very willingly will expend and be expended for your souls; if also loving you more abundantly, the less I should be loved.[16]And let it be, I overloaded you not: but being dexterous, I took you by contrivance.[17]Not any of whom I have sent to you have I by him taken advantage of you.[18]I called for Titus, and sent with a brother. Has Titus taken advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? not in the same steps?[19]Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? before God in Christ we speak: and all things, beloved, for your building up.[20]For I am afraid, lest somehow, having come, I find you not such; as I will, and I find you such as ye wish not: lest somehow, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intrigues, calumnies, whisperings, inflations, derangements:[21]Lest, coming again, my God should humble me with you, and I shall mourn for many of them having sinned before, and not having repented for uncleanness, and fornication, and licentiousness which they committed.","2Cor.13":"[1]This third I come to you. By mouth of two witnesses, and three, shall every word be established.[2]I have said before, and say beforehand, as being present the second; and being away now I write to them having sinned before, and to all the rest, that, if I should come again, I will not spare:[3]Since seek proof of Christ speaking in me, who to you is no weak, but has power in you.[4]For also if he was crucified from weakness, but he lives from the power of God. For also we are weak in him, but we live with him from the power of God to you.[5]Try yourselves, if ye are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless ye are not tried?[6]And I hope that ye shall know that we are not untried.[7]And I pray to God that ye do nothing evil; not that we appear tried, but that ye do good, and we be as untried.[8]For we are not able anything against the truth, but for the truth.[9]For we rejoice when we be weak, and ye be able: and this also we pray, your restoration.[10]For this I write these things being absent, that being present I should not wound severely, according to the power which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.[11]As to the rest, brethren, rejoice. Be adjusted, be comforted, think the same, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall with you.[12]Greet ye one another in a holy kiss.[13]All the holy ones greet you.[14]The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit with you all. Amen.","Gal.1":"[1]Paul, sent, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, having raised him from the dead;)[2]And with me all the brethren, to the churches of Galatia:[3]Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,[4]Having given himself for our sins, that he might take us away out of this present evil time, according to the will of God and our Father:[5]To whom the glory for the time of times. Amen.[6]I wonder that so quickly are ye transferred from him having called you by the grace of Christ to another good news:[7]Which is not another; except some are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ.[8]But also if we, or a messenger from heaven, announce good news to you, more than what: we have announced to you, let him be anathema.[9]As we said before, also now say I again, If any announce to you good news above what ye received, let him be anathema.[10]For now do I persuade men, or God? or seek I to please men? for if I had yet pleased men, I should not have been the servant of Christ.[11]But I make known to you, brethren, the good news announced by me that it is not according to man.[12]For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.[13]For ye heard of my turning about when in Judaism, that in excess I drove out the church of God, and laid it waste:[14]And I advanced in Judaism above many like in my race, being more abundantly zealous of paternal traditions.[15]And when God was contented, having separated me from my mother’s womb, and having called me, by his grace,[16]To reveal his Son in me, that I might announce him the good news in the nations; I consulted not with flesh and blood:[17]Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them sent before me; but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.[18]Then after three years I came up to Jerusalem to examine Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.[19]And other of the sect I saw not, except James the Lord’s brother.[20]And what I write to you, behold, before God, that I lie not.[21]Then came I to the regions of Syria and Cilicia;[22]And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea there in Christ.[23]And only they had heard, That he then driving us out, now announces the good news, the faith which he then felt the absence of.[24]And they glorified God in me.","Gal.2":"[1]Then after fourteen years, again went I up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken together Titus.[2]And I went up according to revelation, and placed before them the good news which I proclaim in the nations, but apart to them highly esteemed, lest I run in vain, or ran.[3]But neither Titus, with me, being a Greek, was forced to be circumcised:[4]And through false brethren introduced privately, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might reduce us to slavery:[5]To whom we yielded in subjection, not for an hour; that the truth of the good news might remain with you.[6]And from them seeming to be something, (whatever they were, it concerns me nothing: God receives not man’s face:) for they seeming entrusted nothing to me:[7]But on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of uncircumcision, as Peter of circumcision;[8](For be having been energetic in Peter for the mission of circumcision, was energetic also in me for the nations:)[9]And having known the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, seeming to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hands of communion; that we for the nations, and they for the circumcision.[10]Only that we remember the poor; and this same was I forward to do.[11]And when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to the face, for he was to be rebuked.[12]For before certain came from James, he ate with the nations: and when they came, he drew down, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.[13]And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.[14]But when I saw that they went not upon the strait road according to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, If thou, being a Jew, livest according to the nations, and not according to the Jews, why forcest thou the nations to live as the Jews?[15]We by nature Jews, and not sinners from the nations,[16]Knowing that a man is not justified from the works of the law, but through faith of Jesus Christ, and we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified from the faith of Christ, and not from the works of the law: therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.[17]And it; seeking to be justified in Christ, we were found also ourselves sinners, is Christ therefore the servant of sin? It may not be.[18]For if what I destroy, these I build again, I unite myself with the transgressor.[19]For I through the law died to the law, that. I might live to God.[20]I am crucified with Christ: and I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in we: and what I now live in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God, having loved me, and given himself for me.[21]I put not away the grace of God for if justice through the law, Christ died in vain.","Gal.3":"[1]O Unwise Galatians, who has cast a spell upon you, not to obey the truth, to whom before the eyes Jesus Christ was written beforehand, crucified in you?[2]This only wish I to learn from you, Received ye the Spirit from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?[3]Are ye so unwise? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now completed in the flesh?[4]Suffered ye so many things in vain? if yet also in vain.[5]He therefore furnishing you the Spirit, and working the powers in you, is it from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?[6]As Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.[7]Know ye therefore that they of faith, these are sons of Abraham.[8]And the writing, foreseeing that of faith God justifies the nations, announced beforehand the good news to Abraham, That in thee shall all nations be praised.[9]So that they of faith are praised with faithful Abraham.[10]For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it has been written, Cursed every one who remains not in all written in the book of the law to do them.[11]And that none is justified in the law before God, is manifest: for, The just shall live of faith.[12]And the law is not of faith: but, The man having done them shall live in them.[13]Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been a curse for us: for it has been written, Cursed every one hanging upon a tree:[14]That the praise of Abraham might be to the nations in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.[15]Brethren, I speak according to man; Although a man’s covenant, having been confirmed, none annuls, or orders an addition.[16]And to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as to many; but as to one: And to thy seed, who is Christ.[17]And I say this, the covenant confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, having been after four hundred and thirty years, does not annul, to neglect the promise.[18]For if of the law the inheritance, no more of promise: and God has favored Abraham by promise.[19]What then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the seed come to whom it was promised;) appointed by angels in the hand of a mediator.[20]And a mediator is not of one, and God is one.[21]The law then against the promises of God? It may not be: for if a law had been given able to make alive, truly justice would be by the law.[22]But the writing shut up all things under sin, that the promise from faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believing.[23]And before faith came, we were guarded under the law, shut up to faith about to be revealed.[24]So that the law was our preceptor towards Christ, that we might be justified from faith.[25]And faith having come, we are no more under a preceptor.[26]For we are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.[27]For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.[28]There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither servant nor free, there is neither male and female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.[29]And if ye of Christ, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.","Gal.4":"[1]And I say, for as long time as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, being lord of all;[2]But is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.[3]So also we, when we were children, were subjugated under the world’s elements:[4]And when the completion of the time was come, God sent his Son, born of woman, born under the law,[5]That he might redeem them under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.[6]And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.[7]So that thou art no more a servant, but a son: and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.[8]But then truly, not having known God, ye were in a servile condition to them not being gods by nature.[9]And now, having known God, and rather known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and poor elements, to which again ye wish anew to be in a servile condition.[10]Ye observe narrowly days, and months, and times, and years.[11]I am afraid of you, lest I have been wearied for you in vain.[12]Be ye as I, for I also as you, brethren, I pray you: ye injured me nothing.[13]And ye know that through weakness of the flesh I announced the good news to you before.[14]And my temptation in my flesh, ye counted not as nothing, nor spurned; but as an angel of God ye received me, as Christ Jesus.[15]What then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, ye would have given to me.[16]Have I then been your enemy, speaking truth to you.[17]They are zealous for you, not well; but they wish to exclude you, that ye might be zealous for them.[18]And good to be zealous always in good, and not only in my being present with you.[19]My children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,[20]And I would be present with you now, and change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.[21]Tell me, those wishing to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?[22]For it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free.[23]But he truly of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; and he of the free through the promise.[24]Which things are spoken figuratively: for these are the two covenants; one truly from mount Sinai, begetting to bondage, which is Agar.[25]For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and now stands in the same rank With Jerusalem, and is in a servile condition with her children.[26]But Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.[27]For it has been written, Be cheered, O barren, bearing not; break out and cry, she travailing not: for many more the children of the desolate than she having a husband.[28]And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise.[29]But as then he born according to the flesh drove out him according to the Spirit, so also now.[30]But what says the writing? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.[31]Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondmaid, but of the free.","Gal.5":"[1]Therefore in the liberty which Christ has freed us, stand ye, and be not again held in the yoke of servitude.[2]Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.[3]And again to any man circumcised, I testify, that he is debtor to do the whole law.[4]Ye were neglected from Christ, whoever are justified in the law; ye have fallen from grace.[5]For we in spirit by faith expect the hope of justice.[6]For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision; but faith being energetic through love.[7]Ye were running well; who hindered you not to obey the truth?[8]The confidence not from him calling you.[9]A little leaven leavens the whole mixture.[10]I have trusted to you in the Lord, that ye will have nothing different in mind; and he troubling you shall bear judgment, whoever he be.[11]And I, brethren, if I yet proclaim circumcision, why am I. yet driven out? therefore the offence of the cross is left unemployed.[12]I would also they shall be cut off who having risen up against you.[13]For ye were called to liberty brethren; only not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but through love serve ye one another.[14]For all the law is completed in one word, in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.[15]And if ye bite and devour one another, see ye that ye be not laid waste by one another.[16]And I say, Walk in Spirit, and complete not the desire of the flesh.[17]For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are adverse to one another: that not the things ye would, these should ye do.[18]And if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.[19]And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,[20]Idolatry, charm, enmities, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intriguings, seditions, sects.[21]Envyings, slaughters, drunkenness, revelries, and the like: to these which I foretell you, as I have also said before, that they doing such shall not inherit the kingdom of God.[22]And the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,[23]Meekness, temperance: against such is no law.[24]And they of Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and desires.[25]If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.[26]Let us not be vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.","Gal.6":"[1]Brethren, if a man be taken in any fault, ye the spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; observing thyself narrowly, lest thou also be tempted.[2]Bear one another’s burdens, and so fill up the law of Christ:[3]For if any think to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.[4]And let each try his own work, and then in himself alone will he have boasting, and not in another.[5]For each shall bear his own load.[6]Let him being taught the word participate with him teaching in all good things.[7]Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man should sow, that also shall he reap.[8]For he sowing to his flesh of the flesh shall reap corruption; but he sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap eternal life.[9]And doing good let us not despond: for in proper time we shall reap, not being enervated.[10]Wherefore then as we have time, let us work good to all, and chiefly to them of the household of faith.[11]See ye how large letters I wrote to you with mine own hand.[12]As many as: wish to have an agreeable demeanor in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should be driven out for the cross of Christ.[13]For neither they being circumcised themselves observe the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they might boast in your flesh.[14]And it may not be to me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.[15]For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision but a new creation.[16]And as many as walk by this model, place upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.[17]For the rest let none cause me fatigues: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ in my body.[18]The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit, brethren.

Amen.","Phil.1":"[1]Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy in Christ Jesus at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:[2]Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.[3]I return thanks to my God for all your remembrance,[4]Always in all my prayer for you all with joy making prayer,[5]For your mutual participation in the good news from the first day until now;[6]Confident of this same, that he having begun a good work in you will complete till the day of Jesus Christ:[7]As it is just for me to think this concerning you all, for my having you in the heart; both in my bonds, and in the justification and confirmation of the good news, ye all being partakers of grace with me.[8]For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.[9]And this I prey, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all intelligence;[10]For you to try things differing; that ye may be pure and not stumbling to the day of Christ;[11]Filled with the fruits of justice, by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.[12]And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me have rather gone to the advancement of the good news;[13]So that my bonds in Christ were manifest in the whole pretorium, and to all the rest;[14]And many of the brethren in the Lord, having trusted to my bonds, more abundantly dared to speak the word fearlessly.[15]And some truly by envy and strife, and some also by kindness of disposition, proclaim Christ.[16]Some truly of hired labor announce Christ, not purely, thinking to bring pressure upon my bonds:[17]And some of love, knowing that I am placed for justification of the good news:[18]For what? but in any manner, whether in pretence, or truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, and certainly I will rejoice.[19]For I know that this shall be turned to me for salvation by your prayer, and the furnishing more of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,[20]According to my anxious expectation, and hope, that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but in all freedom of speech, as always, and now shall Christ be Magnified in my body, whether by life, whether by death.[21]For me to live is Christ, and to die gain.[22]And if to live in the flesh, this to me the fruit of work: and whether I shall be taken away I know not.[23]For I am pressed together from two, having one eager desire to be loosed, and be with Christ (rather much better:)[24]And to tarry yet longer in the flesh is more necessary for you.[25]And confident in this, I know that I shall remain, and shall remain near together with you all for your advancement and joy of faith:[26]That your boasting may abound in Jesus Christ in me, for my coming again to you.[27]Only live as citizens worthy of the good news of Christ: that whether coming and seeing you, whether being absent, I shall bear the things concerning you, that ye stand in one spirit, one soul, fighting together in faith of the good news;[28]And terrified in nothing by them being hostile to you: which to them is truly an indication of destruction, and to you of salvation, and this from God.[29]For upon you was it conferred as a favor for Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him;[30]Having the same struggle which ye saw in me, and now hear in me.","Phil.2":"[1]If therefore any consolation in Christ, if any encouragement of love, if any mutual participation of the Spirit, if any compassions and mercies,[2]Fill ye up my joy, that ye may have the same in mind, having the same love, unanimous, being one in mind.[3]Nothing by hired labor, or vainglory; but in lowliness the leaders hold each other above themselves.[4]Look ye each not on the things of themselves, but also each the things of others.[5]For let this be in mind among you, which also in Christ Jesus;[6]Who, being in the form of God, thought not robbery to be equal to God.[7]But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, born in the likeness of men:[8]And found in fashion as man, he humbled himself, being obedient until death, and the death of the cross.[9]Wherefore God has also exceedingly exalted him, and favored him as a gift with a name above every name:[10]That in the name of Jesus every knee should bend, of the heavenlies, and of terrestrial things, and things under earth[11]And every tongue should avow that the Lord is Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father.[12]Therefore, my beloved, as ye have always listened, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and tremor effect your own salvation.[13]For God is working in you also to will and to work by benevolence.[14]Do ye all things without murmurings and discussions:[15]That ye be complete and pure, children of God, blameless in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom ye appear as luminaries in the world;[16]Holding on to the word of life; for boasting to me in the day of Christ, for I ran not in vain, nor was I wearied in vain.[17]But if also I am poured out upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice together with you all.[18]And do ye also rejoice at the same, and rejoice together with me.[19]And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy quickly to you, that I also be courageous, having known the things concerning you.[20]For I have none having a like soul, who naturally will have care for the things concerning you.[21]For they all seek the things of themselves, and not the things of Christ Jesus.[22]And ye know his proof, that, as a child to a father, he served with me in the good news.[23]Him therefore I truly hope to send, whenever I shall see from it the things concerning me.[24]And I have trusted in the Lord that I myself also shall come quickly.[25]And I thought necessary Epaphroditus, my brother, and cooperator, and fellow-soldier, and your sent, and workman of my necessity, be sent to you.[26]Since he was longing for you all, and harassed because ye heard that he was sick.[27]For also he was sick near to death: but God compassionated him; and not him only, but also me, lest I should have grief upon grief.[28]Therefore I sent him the more earnestly, that, seeing him, ye might again rejoice, and I be more free from sorrow.[29]Therefore receive him in the Lord with all joy; and hold such esteemed.[30]Because for the work of Christ he drew near to death, having exposed the soul to danger, that he might fill up your want of service to me.","Phil.3":"[1]As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.

Are not also ye before our Lord Jesus Christ in his arrival?[20]For ye are our glory and joy.","1Thess.3":"[1]Wherefore no more concealing, we were content to be left among the Athenians alone:[2]And sent Timothy, our brother, and servant of God, and our coworker in the good news of Christ, in order to make you firm, and comfort you for your faith[3]For none to be shaken in these pressures: for ye yourselves know that for this we are placed.[4]For also, when we were with you, we told you before that we were about to be pressed; as also it was, and ye know.[5]For this I also, no more concealing, sent to know your faith, lest some way he tempting have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.[6]And now Timothy having come to us from you, and having announced to us the good news, your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, greatly desiring to see us, as we also you:[7]For this, brethren, were we comforted in you in all our pressure, and necessity by your faith:[8]For now we live, if ye stand in the Lord.[9]For what thankfulness can we return to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for you before our God;[10]Night and day praying exceedingly to see your face, and to adjust things wanting of your faith?[11]And God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you:[12]And the Lord increase you and make you to abound in love to one another, and to all, as also we to you:[13]To make your hearts firm, complete in holiness before God, and our Father, in the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his holy ones.","1Thess.4":"[1]Therefore as to the rest, brethren we ask you, and beseech in the Lord Jesus, as ye received from us how ye must walk and please God, that ye may more abound.[2]For ye know what orders we gave you by the Lord Jesus.[3]For this is the will of God, your consecration, that ye should keep away from fornication:[4]For each of you to know how to possess his vessel in consecration and honour;[5]Not in the passion of eager desire, as also the nations not knowing God:[6]Not to pass over and have the advantage over his brother in business: because the Lord just for all these, as we told you before and testified.[7]But God has not called you to uncleanness, but in consecration.[8]For surely therefore he despising, despises not man, but God, he also giving his holy Spirit for us.[9]And for brotherly love ye have no need to write to you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.[10]For also ye do the same to all the brethren, them in the whole of Macedonia: and we beseech you, brethren, to more abound;[11]And that ye be ambitions to remain quiet, and attend to your own things, and work with your own hands, as we enjoined you;[12]That ye should walk becomingly to them without, and have need of nothing.[13]And I wish you not to be ignorant, brethren, of them having been asleep, that ye should not grieve, as also the rest, they hating no hope.[14]For if we believe that Jesus died and rose up, so also God by Jesus Christ will bring with him them having slept.[15]For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we the living being left at the arrival of the Lord shall not get beforehand with them having slept.[16]For the Lord himself in the word of command, in the voice of the archangel, shall descend from heaven: and the dead in Christ shall be raised first:[17]Then we the living being left shall be snatched up together with them in the clouds, to the meeting of the Lord in the air: and so we shall always be with the Lord.[18]Therefore comfort ye one another with these words.","1Thess.5":"[1]And of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need to write to you.[2]For ye yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord, as a thief in the night, so comes.[3]For when they say, Peace and security; then sudden ruin is upon them, as anguish in her with child; and they may not escape.[4]And ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day as a thief overtake you.[5]Ye are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not of night, nor of darkness.[6]Therefore let us not sleep, as also the rest; but let us watch and be sober.[7]For they sleeping sleep in the night; and they drunken are drunken in the night.[8]And we, being of the day, let us be sober, putting on the coat of mail of faith and love; and a helmet, the hope of salvation.[9]For God set us not for wrath, but for the acquisition of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,[10]He having died for us, that, whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with him.[11]Wherefore comfort one another, and build up one another, as also ye do.[12]And we ask you, brethren, to know those being fatigued among you, and set over you in the Lord, and reminding you;[13]And to think them above ordinary in love for their work. Live in peace in yourselves.[14]And we beseech you, brethren, remind the disorderly, encourage the timid, sustain the weak, and be slow to anger to all.[15]See that any return not evil to any: but always pursue good to one another, and to all.[16]Rejoice always.[17]Pray continually.[18]In every thing return thanks: for this the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.[19]Quench not the Spirit.[20]Set not prophecies at nought.[21]Try all things; hold the good.[22]Keep away from all appearance of evil.[23]And the same God of peace consecrate you perfectly compete; and your whole spirit and soul and body be kept faultless to the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ.[24]Faithful he calling you, who also will do.[25]Brethren, pray for us.[26]Greet all the brethren in a holy kiss.[27]I bind you by oath, for the epistle to be read to all the holy brethren.[28]The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you.

so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.[5]Remember ye not, that, yet being with you, I spake these to you.[6]And now ye know the withholding for him to be revealed in his time.[7]For the mystery of iniquity is already energetic: only he withholding, even till he be out of the midst.[8]And then shall the Lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the spirit of his mouth, and leave unemployed in the splendor of his arrival:[9]Whose arrival is according to the energy of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,[10]And in all deceit of iniquity in the lost; because they received not the love of the truth, for them to be saved.[11]And for this, God shall send them the energy of error, for them to believe in falsehood:[12]That all might be judged not believing the truth but contented in iniquity.[13]And we ought to return thanks to God always for you, brethren dearly beloved by the Lord, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation in consecration of the Spirit and belief of the truth:[14]To which he called you by our good news, to the acquisition of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.[15]Therefore, brethren, stand, and hold firmly the doctrines which ye were taught, whether by the word, or by our epistle.[16]And our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, also our Father, having loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope in grace,[17]Comfort your hearts, and support you in every good word and work.","2Thess.3":"[1]As to the rest, pray, brethren, for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be honoured, as also with you:[2]And that we may be delivered from unfit and evil men: for not faith of all.[3]But the Lord is faithful, who supports you, and will watch from the evil.[4]And we have had confidence in the Lord for you, that what we announce to you, and ye do and will do.[5]And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.[6]And we proclaim to you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to shrink from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the doctrine which he received of us.[7]For ye yourselves know that ye ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;[8]Neither ate we the bread of any as a gift; but in fatigue and toil working night and day also, not to overload any of you:[9]Not that we have not power, but that we give ourselves a type to you to imitate us.[10]For also when we were with you, this we proclaimed to you, that if any will not work, neither should he eat.[11]For we hear some walking disorderly among you, working nothing, but occupied unprofitably.[12]And to such we proclaim and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, with freedom from care working, they should eat their own bread.[13]And ye, brethren, lose not courage doing good.[14]And if any listen not to our word by the epistle, mark him, and mix not together with him, that he may change.[15]And deem not as an enemy, but remind as a brother.[16]And the Lord of peace himself give to you peace for all in every manner.

Amen.","1Tim.1":"[1]Paul, the sent of Jesus Christ according to the command of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, our hope;[2]To Timothy, genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord.[3]As I besought thee to remain in Ephesus, going into Macedonia, that thou mightest proclaim to some not to teach another doctrine,[4]Neither hold to fictions and endless genealogies, which offer questions, rather than the arrangement of God in the faith:[5](And the end of the proclamation is love out of a pure heart, and a good consciousness, and unfeigned faith:[6]Which some having missed turned away to vain discourse.[7]Wishing to be teachers of the law; neither understanding what they say, nor of certain things they are assured.[8]And we know the law good, if any use it lawfully;[9]Knowing this, that the law is laid down not for the just one, but for the lawless and disorderly, for the profane and sinful, for the wicked and unholy, for the patricides and matricides, for manslayers,[10]For fornicators, unchaste, manstealers, liars, the perjured, and if there be any other thing opposed to sound doctrine;[11]According to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.[12]And I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, having strengthened me, for he deemed me faithful, having set me in the service;[13]Being before slandering, expelling, and an abuser: but I was commiserated, because I did, not knowing, in unbelief.[14]And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.[15]Faithful the word, and worthy of all acceptance, for Christ Jesus came into the world to save the sinful; of whom I am first.[16]But for this was I commiserated, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a model to them about to believe on him to eternal life.[17]And to the King of times, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, honour and glory for the times of times. Amen.)[18]This proclamation I set before thee, child Timothy, according to the gifts of prophecy led before upon thee, that thou in them mightest war the good warfare;[19]Having faith, and a good consciousness; which some having rejected concerning faith suffered shipwreck:[20]Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they should not be taught to blaspheme.","1Tim.2":"[1]I Beseech therefore, first of all, supplications to be made, prayers, entreaties, thanks, for all men;[2]For kings, and all them being in eminence; that we may lead a gentle and quiet life, in all devotion and gravity.[3]For this good and acceptable before our Saviour God;[4]Who wills all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.[5]For one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus;[6]Having given himself a ransom for all, a testimony in his own time.[7]For which I was placed a herald, and the sent, (I speak truth in Christ, I lie not;) a teacher of the nations in faith and truth.[8]I will therefore men shall pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger and reasoning.[9]And likewise the women in well arranged simplicity, with modesty and discretion, arrange themselves; not in tresses, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing;[10]But (what become women professing religious worship) with good works.[11]Let the woman, in freedom from care, learn in all subjection.[12]And I trust not the woman to teach, neither to exercise authority over the man, but to be in freedom from care.[13]For Adam was first formed, then Eve.[14]And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, was in the transgression.[15]And she shall be saved through the bringing forth children, if they remain in faith and love and consecration with discretion.","1Tim.3":"[1]Faithful the word, If any strive for superintendence, he eagerly desires a good work.[2]Therefore an overseer must be irreprehensible, husband of one wife, sober, of sound mind, well arranged, hospitable, giving instruction;[3]Not intoxicated, not a quarrelsome person, not occupied in sordid gain; but equitable, without fighting, exempt from avarice;[4]Presiding well over his own house, having the children in subjection with all gravity;[5](but if a man doesn’t know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)[6]Not newly planted, lest rendered proud he fall into condemnation of the accuser.[7]And he must also have good testimony from them without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the accuser.[8]Deacons likewise grave, not speaking equivocally, not holding to much wine, not occupied in sordid gain;[9]Having the mystery of faith in pure consciousness.[10]And let these also first be tried; then let them perform the office of footman, being blameless.[11]Wives also grave, not accusers, sober, faithful in all things.[12]Let the deacons be husbands of one wife, presiding well over the children and their own houses.[13]For they having served well, acquire to themselves a good step, and much freedom of speech in the faith which in Christ Jesus.[14]These I write to thee, hoping to come to thee quickly:[15]And if I delay, that thou shouldest know how thou must be occupied in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.[16]And manifestly great is the mystery of devotion: God was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed in the nations, was believed on in the world, was received up in glory.","1Tim.4":"[1]And the Spirit says expressly, that in later times some shall be removed from the faith, holding to deceitful spirits, and doctrines of evil spirits;[2]In the hypocrisy of speaking falsely;

if she have brought up children, if she lodged strangers, if she washed the feet of the holy, if she relieved the pressed, if she followed every good work.[11]And the younger widows reject: for when they conduct themselves arrogantly against Christ, they wish to marry:[12]Having judgment, for they put away the first faith.[13]And at the same time also they learn to be idle, going round about the houses; and not only idle, but also indulging in idle talk, and occupied with unnecessary things, speaking things not becoming.[14]I wish therefore the younger to marry, to bear children, to rule the house, to give no occasion to him opposing for reproach.[15]For already have some turned aside after Satan.[16]If any man or woman faithful have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be loaded; that it may relieve the truly widows.[17]Let the elders having presided well be deemed worthy of double honour, chiefly they being wearied in word and doctrine.[18]For the writing says, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox grinding. And, The laborer worthy of his hire.[19]Against an elder receive not an accusation from without, except from two or three witnesses.[20]Them having sinned rebuke before all, that the rest also have fear.[21]I call to witness before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that thou watch these things without preference, doing nothing by bending.[22]Put hands swiftly upon none, nor participate in others’ sins: keep thyself pure.[23]Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.[24]Some men’s sins are manifest, going before to judgment; and also to some they follow in the train.[25]Likewise also the good works of some are manifest; and having these otherwise, it cannot be hid.","1Tim.6":"[1]Let as many servants as are under the yoke deem their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the doctrines be not defamed.[2]And let them having faithful masters not despise, for they are brethren; but rather let them serve, because they are faithful and dearly beloved, they having mutually received of the beneficence. These things teach and beseech.[3]If any teach otherwise, and come not up to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine according to devotion;[4]He has been proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and disputes of words, of which is envy, strife, slanders, evil conjectures,[5]Unprofitable occupations of men corrupted in mind, and deprived of the truth, thinking gain to be devotion: be separated from such.[6]But devotion with contentment is great gain.[7]For we brought nothing into the world, it is manifest that neither are we able to carry anything out.[8]And having sustenance and covering, with these let us be contented.[9]And they wishing to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many eager desires, unwise and hurtful, which sink men into ruin and perdition.[10]For the root of all evils is the love of money: which some striving for, have been led astray from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many pains.[11]And thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow justice, devotion, faith, love, patience, meekness.[12]Contend earnestly the good contest of faith, take hold upon eternal life, into which thou wert also called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses.[13]I beseech thee before God, making all things alive, and Christ Jesus, he having witnessed to Pontius Pilate the good confession;[14]For thee to keep the command spotless, irreprehensible, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ:[15]Which the blessed and only sovereign shall show in his own times, the King of those reigning, and Lord of those ruling;[16]Who only having immortality, inhabiting inaccessible light; which none of men saw, nor can see; to whom honour and might forever.

And, Let every one naming the name of Christ remove from iniquity.[20]And in a great house there is not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and earthen; and some truly for honour, and some for dishonour.[21]If therefore any cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel for honour, consecrated, and useful for the master, prepared for every good work.[22]And flee youthful, eager desires: and follow justice, faith, love, peace, with them calling upon the Lord from a pure heart.[23]And silly and ignorant questions refuse, knowing that they produce strifes.[24]And the servant of the Lord must not contend; but be gentle to all, giving instruction, enduring evil,[25]In meekness instructing them being in a contrary state; lest perhaps God may give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth;[26]That they may return to a state of sobriety from the snare of the devil, being taken alive by him at his will.","2Tim.3":"[1]And this know, that in the last days difficult times shall interpose.[2]For men shall be self-lovers, lovers of money, boastful, proud, slandering, disobedient to parents, unthankful, wicked,[3]Devoid of natural affection, not observing treaties, accusers, ungoverned, wild, not loving the good,[4]Traitors, rash, haughty, devoted to pleasure more than loving God;[5]Having a form of devotion, and having denied its power: and these renounce.[6]For of these are they going into houses, and taking captive little women heaped up with sins, led away with various eager desires,[7]Always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.[8]And as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also these have withstood the truth: men corrupted in mind, not tried concerning the faith.[9]But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also was.[10]And thou hast closely followed my doctrine, mode of life, purpose, faith, long suffering, love, patience,[11]Expulsions, sufferings, which were to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what expulsions I endured: and the Lord delivered me from all.[12]And all wishing to live devotedly in Christ Jesus shall be driven out.[13]And evil men and impostors shall proceed to worse, deceiving, and being deceived.[14]And remain thou in what things thou hast learned and hast been convinced of, knowing of whom thou hast learned;[15]And that from infancy thou hast known the holy letters, able to render thee wise to salvation by faith which in Christ Jesus.[16]All writing divinely inspired, and profitable for doctrine, for refutation, for correction, for instruction in justice:[17]That the man of God might be perfect, finished for every good work.","2Tim.4":"[1]I call to witness before God there fore, and the Lord Jesus Christ, being about to judge the living and the dead according to his appearance and his kingdom;[2]Proclaim the word; keep fixed seasonably, and unseasonably; refute, censure, beseech, in all longsuffering and teaching.[3]For the time will be when they will not hear sound doctrine; but according to their own eager desires they will heap up to themselves teachers, feeling itchings for a report;[4]And truly from the truth will they turn away the hearing, and be turned aside to fictions.[5]And thou be sober in all things, suffer ill treatment, do the work of the bearer of good news, render thy service perfectly certain.[6]For I am already poured out, and the time of my deliverance has been fixed.[7]I have contended earnestly the good contest, I have completed the course, I have kept the faith:[8]As to the rest, the crown of justice is laid up for me, which the Lord will assign to me in that day, the just judge: and not only to me, but also to all them having loved his appearance.[9]Be earnest to come to me quickly.[10]For Demas has forsaken me, having loved the time now, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.[11]Luke alone is with me. Having taken Mark, bring with thyself: for he is useful for the service.[12]And Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.[13]The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring, and the books, chiefly the parchments.[14]Alexander the coppersmith showed me much evil: (may the Lord give back to him according to his works:)[15]Whom watch thou also; for he greatly withstood our words.[16]In my first defence none was present with me, but all forsook me; (may it not be reckoned to them.)[17]But the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the promulgation might be rendered perfectly certain, and all the nations might hear: and I was delivered out of the lion’s mouth.[18]And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and save for his heavenly kingdom: to whom the glory for the times of times. Amen.[19]Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.[20]Erastus remained in Corinth: and Trophimus I left in Miletum sick.[21]Be earnest to come before winter Eubulus greets thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.[22]The Lord Jesus Christ with thy Spirit. Grace with you. Amen.","Titus.1":"[1]Paul, servant of God, and sent of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen of God, and the acknowledgment of the truth according to devotion;[2]In hope of eternal life, (which God, not false, promised before eternal times;[3]And manifested his word in his own times, in the proclamation, which I was entrusted with according to the command of the Saviour our God;)[4]To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.[5]For this I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest rectify things left behind, and set elders in the city, as I directed thee:[6]If any be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of licentiousness, or disorderly.[7]For a bishop must be irreproachable, as steward of God; not self-sufficient, not prone to anger, not intemperate, not a striker, not occupied in sordid gain.[8]But hospitable, a lover of good, of sound mind, just, holy, holding firm;[9]Holding firmly the faithful word according to instruction, that he may be able also to beseech in sound doctrine, and to refute those opposing.[10]For many also are disorderly, vain talkers and infatuates, especially they of the circumcision:[11]Who must be restrained, who subvert whole houses, teaching what they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.[12]A certain of them said, their own prophet, The Cretians always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.[13]This testimony is true. For this cause reprove them severely, that they may be sound in the faith;[14]Not holding to Jewish fictions, and commands of men, having turned away from the truth.[15]All things truly pure to the pure: and to the defiled and unbelieving nothing pure; but also their mind and consciousness are defiled.[16]They confess to know God; and in works they deny, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work not tried.","Titus.2":"[1]And do thou speak what becomes sound doctrine:[2]The aged men to be sober, grave, of sound mind, sound in the faith, in love, in patience.[3]The aged women likewise, becoming holy in a serene state of mind, not accusers, not slaves to much wine, teachers of good;[4]That they render the young women discreet, to be lovers of the husband, lovers of the children,[5]Of sound mind chaste, remaining at home, good subordinates to their own husbands, that the word of God be not defamed.[6]The younger men likewise beseech to be of sound mind.[7]Concerning all things hold thyself a type of good works: in doctrine, integrity, gravity, incorruptibility,[8]The word sound, not to be condemned; that he from the opposite may be changed, having nothing bad to say of you.[9]Servants to be subordinate to their own masters, to be pleasing in all things; not contradicting;[10]Not purloining, but showing all good faith; that they may adorn the doctrine of the Saviour our God in all things.[11]For the grace of God who saves, was manifested to all men,[12]Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and eager worldly desires, we should live discreetly, and justly, and religiously, in the time now;[13]Expecting the blessed hope, and appearance of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;[14]Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a distinguished people, zealous of good works.[15]These things speak, and beseech, and reprove with all order.

These things are good and profitable to men.[9]And foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and conflicts pertaining to the law, avoid; for they are unprofitable and vain.[10]A man, a heretic after one and the second admonition, reject;[11]Knowing such to be turned back, and he sins, being self-condemned.[12]When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, be earnest to come to me at Nicopolis: for there have I chosen to pass the winter.[13]Send forward zealously Zenas pertaining to the law, and Apollos, that nothing fail them.[14]And let ours also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.[15]All they with me greet thee.

Amen.","Heb.1":"[1]God, formerly multifariously and abundantly having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,[2]At these last days spake to us in the Son, whom he set heir of all things, by whom also he made the times;[3]Who being the brightness of glory, and the figure of his foundation, and bearing all things by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty among the highest ones;[4]Being so much better than the angels, inasmuch as he has inherited a more distinguished name than they.[5]For to which of the angels once said he, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for Father, and he shall be to me for Son?[6]And when again he should bring in the firstborn to the habitable globe, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.[7]And truly to the angels of God he says, Who making his angels spirits, and his workmen flames of fire.[8]And to the Son, Thy throne, O God, for the time of time: a rod of uprightness the rod of thy kingdom.[9]Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity; for this God anointed thee, thy God, with the oil of lively joy above thy partakers.[10]And, Thou, at the beginning, Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands:[11]These shall be destroyed; but thou remainest; and they all as a garment shall grow old;[12]And as a cloak shalt thou turn them round, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.[13]And to which of the angels has he once said, Sit on my right hand, till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?[14]Are they not all spirits qualified for service, sent forth for service for them about to inherit salvation?","Heb.2":"[1]For this ought we to hold above measure to the things heard, lest we slip away.[2]For if the word spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and bad instruction received the just payment of reward;[3]How shall we escape, having neglected such great salvation; which at the beginning taken to be spoken by the Lord, by them having heard was made firm to us;[4]God confirming the testimony, together with signs and wonders, and various powers, and partitions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will.[5]For not to the angels has he subjected the habitable globe about to be, of which we speak.[6]And somewhere a certain one testified, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him? or the son of man, that thou reviewest him?[7]Thou didst render him some little while less than angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst place him over the work of thine hands:[8]All things didst thou place under his feet. For in placing all things under him, thou didst leave nothing not subjected to him. And now we see not yet all things placed under him.[9]But we see Jesus, made some little while less than angels by the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste of death for all.[10]For it became him, for whom all things, and by whom all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the chief of their salvation by sufferings.[11]For be consecrating and they being consecrated all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,[12]Saying, I will announce thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the church will I praise thee.[13]And again, I will be confident in him. And again, Behold I and the young children which God gave me.[14]Since therefore the young children participated in flesh and blood, he also likewise participated with them; that by death he might leave unemployed him having the strength of death, that is, the devil;[15]And deliver them, as many as by fear of death were always to live bound by slavery.[16]For certainly he lays not hold of angels; but of the seed of Abraham he lays hold.[17]Wherefore in all things it was necessary to be made like to the brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful chief priest in things towards God, in order to propitiate for the sin of the people.[18]For in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help the tempted.","Heb.3":"[1]Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, observe the sent and Chief Priest of our assent, Christ Jesus;[2]Faithful to him having made him, as also Moses in his whole house.[3]For this was deemed worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he has greater honour of the house having built it.[4]For every house is built by somebody; and he having built all things, God.[5]And truly Moses faithful in his whole house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things to be spoken;[6]And Christ as a son over his house: whose house are we, if we should hold freedom of speech and the boast of hope firm to the end.[7]Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit says, If to day ye hear his voice,[8]Harden not your hearts, as in the exasperation, in the day of trial in the desert:[9]Where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.[10]Wherefore I was offended with that generation and I said, They always wander in heart; and they knew not my ways.[11]As I aware in my wrath, If they shall come into my rest.)[12]See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in removing away from the living God.[13]But beseech one another according to each day, as far as the day is called; lest any of you be hardened by deceit of sin.[14]For we have been partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our foundation firm to the end;[15]In that it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, ye should not harden your hearts, as in the exasperation.[16]For some, having heard, did exasperate: but not all they having come out of Egypt by Moses.[17]And with whom was he offended forty years? was it not with them having sinned, whose members fell in the desert?[18]And to whom sware he that they could not come into his rest, if not to them having been disobedient?[19]And we see they could not come in through unbelief.","Heb.4":"[1]Let us therefore fear, lest a solemn promise being left to come into his rest, any of you should seem to have failed.[2]For we also were announced of the good news, as well as they: but the word of the report profited them not, not being mixed with faith to them having heard.[3]For we having believed come into the rest, as he said, As I sware in my wrath, if they shall come into my rest: although the works having been from the foundation of the world.[4]For he said somewhere of the seventh thus, And God ceased in the seventh day from all his works.[5]And in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.[6]Since therefore it remains for some to come into it, and they before announced of the good news came not in through unbelief:[7]Again he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after such time; as it is said, To day if ye would hear his voice, harden not your hearts.[8]For if Jesus had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken of another day after these things.[9]Therefore a celebration of a sabbath remains to the people of God.[10]For he having come into his rest, he also has ceased from his works, as God from his own.[11]Therefore we should be earnest to come into that rest, lest any should fall in the same pattern of unbelief.[12]For the word of God living, and effective, and more piercing than any two-mouthed sword, and penetrating even to the division both of soul and spirit, both the joints and marrows, and a critic of the reflections and thoughts of the heart.[13]And there is no creation invisible before him: and all things naked and exposed, neck and face to view, to the eyes of him with whom to us is the word.[14]Having therefore a great chief priest, passed to the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we should hold firmly the assent.[15]For we have not a chief priest unable to suffer with our weaknesses; but tried in all things as a resemblance, without sin.[16]We should therefore go with freedom of speech to the throne of grace, that we receive mercy, and find grace for timely assistance.","Heb.5":"[1]For every chief priest taken from men is appointed for men for things to God, that he bring both gifts and sacrifices for sins:[2]Being able to moderate the passions to the ignorant, and deceived; since he also is surrounded with weakness.[3]And for this he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to bring in for sins.[4]And not any takes this honour to himself; but the called of God, as also Aaron.[5]So also Christ honoured not himself, to become chief priest; but he having spoken to him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.[6]And also in another he says, Thou a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.[7]Who in the days of his flesh, both prayers and supplications to him able to save him from death, with strong crying and tears, having offered, and listened to by means of circumspection;[8]Although being a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;[9]And being perfected, he became to all them lending a willing ear to him the origin of eternal salvation.[10]Addressed by God the chief priest according to the order of Melchisedec.[11]Of whom great is the word to us, and difficult of interpretation to speak, since ye have been sluggish in the hearing.[12]For also ye ought to be teachers for the time, again ye have need for some one to teach you the elements of the beginning of the sayings of God; and have become those having need of milk, and not of firm food.[13]For every one partaking of milk is inexperienced in the word of justice: for he is a child.[14]And firm food is of the perfected, of them by habit having the senses exercised for the separation of good and evil.","Heb.6":"[1]Therefore having left the word of the beginning of Christ, we should go on to perfection; not again laying down the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,[2]Of the teaching of immersions, and placing upon of hands, and of the rising up of the dead, and of eternal judgment.[3]And this will we do, if God even permit.[4]For impossible for them once enlightened, and having tasted of the heavenly gift, and having partaken of the Holy Spirit,[5]And tasted of the good word of God, and powers of the life about to be,[6]And having fallen, again to renew to repentance; crucifying to themselves the Son of God, and exposing to ignominy.[7]For the earth drinking the rain coming often upon it, and bringing forth the vegetable fitting well to them by whom it is cultivated, receives commendation from God:[8]And producing thorns and briers is rejected, after having been tried, and near cursing; whose end for destruction.[9]And we have been persuaded of you, dearly beloved, of better things, and connected with salvation, if we also thus speak.[10]For God is not unjust to forget your work and fatigue of love, which ye showed to his name, having served to the holy ones, and serving.[11]And we desire each of you to show the same earnestness to the complete certainty of hope to the end:[12]That ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them inheriting the promises by faith and longsuffering.[13]For God promising to Abraham, since he had none greater to swear by, sware by himself,[14]Saying, Truly will I praise thee, and multiplying will I multiply thee.[15]And so, having endured long, he gained the promise.[16]For truly men swear by the greater: and the oath for confirmation to them the end of all controversy.[17]In which God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the firmness of his counsel, he intervened by an oath:[18]That by two unalterable deeds, in which it is impossible for God to deceive we might have a strong consolation, taking refuge in holding firmly the hope set before:[19]Which we have as an anchor of the soul, unshaken and firm, and entering into that further within the veil.[20]Where the forerunner, Jesus, went in for us, according to the order of Melchisedec, being a high priest forever.","Heb.7":"[1]For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, having met Abraham returning from the cutting off of the kings, and praised him;[2]To whom also Abraham divided a tenth from all; (first truly interpreted King of justice, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;[3]Without father, without mother, of unknown origin, neither having beginning of days, nor end of life; and likened to the Son of God;) remains a priest perpetually.[4]And behold how great this one, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave the tenth of the first fruits.[5]And they truly of the sons of Levi, receiving the office of priest, have a command to take a tenth part from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, although having come out of the loins of Abraham:[6]And he not having his descent traced from them received a tenth from Abraham, and praised him having the promises.[7]And without all controversy the less is praised of the better.[8]And here truly dying men receive tenths; but there he, bearing witness that he lives.[9]And as the word says, through Abraham, also Levi, receiving tenths, has paid a tenth.[10]For yet was he in his father’s loins, when Melchisedec met him.[11]If truly therefore completion were by the Levitical priesthood, (for the people received legislation by it,) what further need according to the order of Melchisedec for another priest to be raised, and not according to the order of Aaron?[12]For the priesthood being transferred, of necessity also is a transposition of law.[13]For he of whom these things are said partook of another tribe, of which none held to the altar.[14]For it is manifest that our Lord has sprung out of Judah; to which tribe Moses spake nothing of the priesthood.[15]And it is yet more abundantly manifest: that according to the resemblance of Melchisedec has another priest risen,[16]Who according to the law of a fleshly command was not born, but according to the power of an indestructible life.[17]For he testifies, Thou a priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec.[18]For there is truly an annulling of the command going before by its weakness and unprofitableness.[19](For the law completed nothing,) but the bringing in of a better hope; by which we draw near to God.[20]And as much as not without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath:[21](For they truly without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath became priests; but he with the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath by him, saying to him, The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec:)[22]According to this, Jesus has become security of a better covenant.[23]And they truly are become many priests, by reason of death being hindered from remaining:[24]And he, because he remains forever, has an inviolable priesthood.[25]Wherefore he is able to save entirely those coming to God by him, always living to supplicate for them.[26]For such a chief priest became us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and being higher than the heavens;[27]Who has no necessity according to the day, as the chief priests, before to bring up sacrifices for their own sins, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having brought up himself.[28]For the law establishes men chief priests having weakness; but the word of the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath, after the law, the Son, having been perfected forever.","Heb.8":"[1]And the summary to the things spoken: We have such a chief priest, who sat on the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;[2]A workman of holy things, and of the true tent, which the Lord pitched, and not man.[3]For every chief priest is appointed to bring in gifts and sacrifices also: wherefore it is necessary also for this to have something which he might bring.[4]For if truly he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being priests bringing in gifts according to the law;[5]Who serve the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was given an intimation of the divine will, being about to complete the tent: for, See, says he, thou make all things according to the type shewed thee in the mount.[6]And now he has attained a more distinguished office, in how much also he is mediator of a better covenant, which was legislated upon better promises.[7]For if that first was faultless, then place was not to be sought for the second.[8]For rebuking them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, and I will complete for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant:[9]Not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in the day of my taking their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they remained not in my covenant, and I heeded them not, says the Lord.[10]For this the covenant which I will set to the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; giving my laws into their mind, and upon their hearts will I write them: and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people:[11]And they should not teach each his neighbor, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from their little even to their great ones.[12]For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their injustices will I remember no more.[13]In saying new, he has made the first old. And that made old and becoming weak is near destruction.","Heb.9":"[1]And truly therefore the first had precepts of divine service for him, and a worldly holy place.[2]For the first tent was prepared; (in which was the chandelier, and table, and the setting up of the loaves;) which is called holy.[3]And after the second veil, the tent called Holy of Holies;[4]Having the golden censer, and ark of the covenant surrounded on all sides with gold, in which was the golden urn having the manna, and Aaron’s rod having budded, and the tables of the covenant;[5]And above it the cherubs of glory overshadowing the propitiatory; of which it is not now to speak in turn.[6]And these thus prepared, truly to the first tent the priests always came in, to complete the divine services.[7]And into the second the chief priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he brings near for himself, and the errors of the people:[8]This the Holy Spirit designating, the way of the holies had not yet been made manifest, the first tent yet having a standing:[9]Which a parable for the time placed in, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are brought near, not being able for consciousness to perfect him serving;[10]Only in food and drinks, and different immersions, and precepts of the flesh, being placed till the time of amendment.[11]And Christ being present, a chief priest of good things about to be, by a greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is; not of this creation;[12]Neither by the blood of he-goats and calves, and by his own blood he went in once for all to the holies, having found eternal deliverance.[13]For if the blood of bulls and he-goats, and the ashes of a heifer besprinkling the polluted, consecrates to the purity of the flesh:[14]How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself blameless to God, purify your consciousness from dead works to serve the living God?[15]And for this he is mediator of a new covenant, that death having been, for redemption of the transgressions for the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.[16]For where a will, the necessity for the death of him having willed to be brought forward.[17]For a will is firm by the dead: since it has no power when he having willed lives.[18]Wherefore neither was the first consecrated without blood.[19]For every command spoken according to law by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of calves and he-goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and also the book, and he sprinkled all the people,[20]Saying, This the blood of the covenant which God enjoined to you.[21]And also the tent, and all the vessels of the service, he poured all over likewise with blood.[22]And almost all things are purified according to the law with blood; and without blood-letting there is no remission.[23]Therefore truly a necessity for the patterns of things in the heavens to be purified with these; and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.[24]For Christ came not into the holy places made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be shown clearly to the face of God for us:[25]Neither that he should offer himself many times, as the chief priest comes in to the holy places yearly with blood pertaining to others;[26](Since he must have suffered many times from the foundation of the world:) but now once at the termination of the times for the annulling of sin by the sacrifice of himself has he been shown clearly.[27]And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this the judgment:[28]So Christ, once offered to have borne the sins of many, of the second time, without sin, shall be seen to them expecting him for salvation.","Heb.10":"[1]For the law having a shadow of good things about to be, not the same image of the things, with these sacrifices which they bring in yearly in continuance never can render perfect them coming thereto.[2]For would they not have ceased to be brought in? because they serving have no more consciousness of sins, once purified.[3]But in these, a reminding of sins yearly.[4]For the blood of bulls and he-goats cannot take away sins.[5]Wherefore coming into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering then wouldest not, but a body hast thou adjusted to me:[6]And with whole burnt offering for sin wast thou not contented.[7]Then said I, Behold, I am here (in the head of the book it was written of me,) O God, to do thy will.[8]Farther back, saying, That sacrifice and bringing in and whole burnt offerings and for sin thou wouldest not, neither wert contented with; which are brought in according to law;[9]Then he said, Behold, I am here to do, O God, thy will. He takes away the first, that he might set up the second.[10]In which will we are consecrated by the bringing in of the body of Jesus Christ once.[11]And truly every priest has stood daily, serving and bringing in many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:[12]But this, having brought in one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;[13]As to the rest, awaiting till his enemies be put a footstool of his feet.[14]For by one offering has he perfected forever the consecrated.[15]And also the Holy Spirit testifies to us: for after having said before,[16]This the covenant which I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws upon their heart, and upon their minds will I write them;[17]And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.[18]And where remission of these, no more bringing in for sin.[19]Having therefore, brethren, freedom of speech for the entering in of the holies by the blood of Jesus,[20]A way publicly declared and living, which he consecrated to us, through the veil, that is, his flesh;[21]And a great priest over the house of God;[22]Let us approach with a true heart in complete certainty of faith, having our hearts be sprinkled from an evil consciousness, and having our bodies washed with pure water.[23]We should hold the assent of hope not bending; (for faithful he having promised;)[24]And we should observe one another for the incitement of love and good works:[25]Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom to some; but beseeching: and by so much the more, inasmuch as ye see the day drawing near.[26]For we sinning voluntarily after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is left no more a sacrifice for sins,[27]But a certain terrible expectation of judgment and jealousy of fire, being about to devour the adversaries.[28]Any one having rejected Moses’ law, without compassion dies by two or three witnesses:[29]Of how much worse punishment, think ye, shall he be deemed worthy, having trodden down the Son of God, and deemed the blood of the covenant common, in which he was consecrated, and having outraged the Spirit of grace?[30]For we know him having said, Vengeance to me, I will give back, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.[31]Terrible to fall into the hands of the living God.[32]And recall to mind the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye endured a great combat of sufferings;[33]This, truly, being exposed to public view both by reproaches and pressures; and this, having been partakers of those thus overturned.[34]For ye also suffered together with me in bonds, and received the pillage of your possessions with joy, knowing to have in yourselves a better and abiding substance in the heavens.[35]Throw not away therefore your freedom of speech, which has great payment of reward.[36]For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.[37]For yet a little while only, he coming will come, and will not tarry.[38]And the just one shall live by faith; but if he draw down, my soul is not contented in him.[39]And we are not of drawing down to perdition; but of faith to the acquisition of the soul.","Heb.11":"[1]And faith is the foundation of things hoped for, the proof of things not seen.[2]For by this were the elders testified of.[3]By faith we perceive that the times were adjusted by the word of God, so that things seen have been born not of things brought to light.[4]By faith Abel brought near a greater sacrifice to God than Cain, by which he was testified of to be just, God testifying of his gifts; and by it he being dead yet speaks.[5]By faith Enoch was transferred not to see death; and was not found, because God had transferred him: for before his transferring he had been testified of, to have pleased God.[6]And without faith it is impossible to please: for he approaching to God must believe that he is, and is a remunerator to them seeking him out.[7]By faith Noah, having an intimation of the divine will of things not yet seen, being circumspect, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house; by which he condemned the world, and by faith became an heir of justice.[8]By faith Abraham, being called, listened, to go forth into the place which he was about to receive for an inheritance; and he came out, not knowing where he is coming.[9]By faith he dwelt in the land of promise, as a strange land, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise:[10]For he awaited a city having foundations, whose artificer and maker is God.[11]By faith Sara also herself received power for the laying down of seed, and brought forth during the time of age, for she deemed him faithful having promised.[12]Wherefore also from one were they born, and these of him having been dead, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand near the lip of the sea innumerable.[13]According to faith died all these, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar, and been persuaded, and having embraced, and assented that they are strangers and newly arrived from a foreign country upon earth.[14]For they saying such things show clearly that they seek a country.[15]And truly if they remembered that from which they came out, they had time to have returned.[16]And now they feel an ardent desire for a better, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God: for he prepared for them a city.[17]By faith Abraham had brought near Isaac, being tried: and he having received the promises brought near the only born,[18]To whom it was spoken, That in Isaac shall seed be called to thee:[19]Reckoning that God was also able to raise from the dead; whence he also received him in a parable.[20]By faith concerning things about to be, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.[21]By faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons; and worshipped, upon the extremity of his rod.[22]By faith Joseph, dying, made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel: and charged concerning his bones.[23]By faith Moses, born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw a shrewd child; and they were not afraid of the edict of the king.[24]By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be reckoned the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;[25]Having chosen rather to be treated ill with the people of God, than to have the enjoyment of sin for a time;[26]Having deemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than treasures in Egypt: for he looked to the payment of reward.[27]By faith he forsook Egypt, not having feared the king’s wrath: for, as seeing the invisible, he was strong.[28]By faith he has kept the pascha, and the pouring out of blood, lest he destroying the first born should touch them.[29]By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians having tried were swallowed down.[30]By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been surrounded for seven days.[31]By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with the unbelieving, having received the spies with peace.[32]And what more do I say? for the time will fail me recounting of Gedeon, Barak, and also Samson and Jephthae; David also, and Samuel, and the prophets:[33]Who by faith subdued kingdoms, wrought justice, attained the promises, shut up the mouths of lions,[34]Quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were strengthened from weakness, were strong in war, turned away the armies of strangers.[35]Women received their dead from rising up: and others were beaten, not receiving redemption; that they might attain a better resurrection.[36]And others received trial of jestings and scourges, and further, of bonds and imprisonment:[37]They were stoned, they were cut by sawing, they were tried, they died by the slaughter of the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being in want, pressed, treated ill;[38](Of whom the world was not worthy:) wandering about in solitary places, and mountains, and caves, and holes of the earth.[39]And these all, having been testified of by faith, received not the promise:[40]God having foreseen something better for us, that without us they should not be completed.","Heb.12":"[1]Wherefore we also having such a cloud of witnesses lying round about us, having laid down every weight, and sin easily captivating, by patience we should run the race set before us,[2]Looking in the distance to Jesus the author and completer of the faith; who for the joy laid before him endured the cross, having despised the shame, and sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.[3]For reckon over him having endured such contradiction of the sinful against himself, lest being harassed, ye labor in your souls.[4]Ye have not yet resisted until blood, fighting against sin.[5]And ye have totally forgotten the entreaty which is spoken to you as to sons, My son, neglect not the instruction of the Lord, nor be enervated being rebuked by him:[6]For whom the Lord loves he corrects, and he chastises every son which he receives.[7]If ye endure correction, God treats you as sons; for who is the son which the father corrects not?[8]And if ye are without correction, of which all are partakers, then are ye spurious, not sons.[9]Since we truly have fathers of our flesh instructors, and we were influenced: shall we not rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and we shall live?[10]For they truly for a few days, according as it seemed to them, corrected; but he for profit, in order to partake in his holiness.[11]And truly every correction for the present seems not to be for joy, but grief: and later it returns the peaceful fruit of justice to them being exercised by it.[12]Wherefore set upright the relaxed hands, and palsied knees;[13]And make straight wheel-ruts to your feet, lest the lame thing turned aside; and it should rather be healed.[14]Follow peace with all, and consecration, without which none shall see the Lord:[15]Observing narrowly lest any be failing of the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness springing forth aloft give trouble, and by this many be defiled;[16]Lest any fornicator, or profane, as Esau, who for one act of eating sold his primogeniture.[17]For ye know also afterwards, wishing to inherit the praise, he was disapproved of: for he found no place for a change of mind, although having sought it with tears.[18]For ye have not come to the mount being handled, and burned with fire, and to duskiness, and to darkness, and to a violent storm,[19]And to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words; which they, having heard, implored that the word be not put before them:[20](For they did not bear that being assigned, And if a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shall be pierced with a missile weapon:[21]And so dreadful was that being made to appear, Moses said, I am terrified and trembling:)[22]But ye have come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,[23]To the assembly of people, and church of the firstborn, transcribed in the heavens, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the just perfected,[24]And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than Abel.[25]See that ye refuse not him speaking.

For good the heart be rendered firm by grace; not by food, in which they having walked about were not profited.[10]We have an altar, of which they serving the tent have no power to eat.[11]For of whom the blood of the living ones is brought for sin into the holies by the chief priest, the bodies of these are burned without the camp.[12]Wherefore also Jesus, that he might consecrate the people by his own blood, suffered without the camp.[13]Therefore we should come to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.[14]For here have we no abiding city, but we seek that about to be.[15]By him therefore we should always bring up the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of the lips assenting to his name.[16]And the doing good and mutual participation forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.[17]Believe them guiding you, and yield: (for they watch vigilantly for your souls, as going to return the word.) that with joy they might do this, and not lamenting: for this unprofitable for you.[18]Pray for us: for we have trusted that we have a good consciousness, in all things wishing to be well occupied.[19]And I beseech the more abundantly to do this, that I might the more speedily be restored to you.[20]And the God of peace, having brought up from the dead, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of the eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ,[21]Put you in proper order in every good work for doing his will, doing in you the thing pleasing before him, by Jesus Christ; to whom glory for the time of times. Amen.[22]And I beseech you, brethren, hold up the word of entreaty: for I also sent to you in a few words.[23]Ye know the brother Timothy having been set at liberty; with whom, if he come more speedily, I shall see you.[24]Greet all them guiding you, and all the holy.[25]They from Italy greet you.

Is any cheerful? let him play on the harp.[14]Is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord:[15]And the prayer of faith shall save him being sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he should have wrought sins, it shall be remitted to him.[16]Acknowledge your faults to one another, and pray for one another, that ye might be healed. The prayer of the just, being energetic, is very powerful.[17]Elias was a man having similar feelings with us, and in prayer he prayed for it not to rain: and it rained not upon the earth for three years and six months.[18]And again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth shot forth her fruit.[19]Brethren, if any among you be led astray from the truth, and any should turn him back;[20]Let him know, that he having turned the sinful from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.","1Pet.1":"[1]Peter, sent of Jesus Christ, to the chosen strangers of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,[2]According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the consecration of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.[3]Praised the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy having begotten us again to a living hope, by the rising up of Jesus Christ from the dead,[4]To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, kept in the heavens for us,[5]Who by the power of God watching ourselves by faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.[6]By which ye are transported with joy, now for a little, (if it is necessary,) having grieved in various temptations:[7]That the proof of your faith, much more precious than perishing gold, and being tried by fire, might be found to praise and honour and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ:[8]Whom not having seen, ye love; in whom, now not seeing, but believing, ye are transported with joy unalterable, and highly valued:[9]Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of souls.[10]For which salvation the prophets sought and inquired anxiously, they having prophesied of the grace to you:[11]Searching for whom or what time the Spirit of Christ which in them manifested, testifying beforehand the sufferings to Christ, and the glories after these.[12]To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were serving these things, which now have been again proclaimed to you by them having announced the good news in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; into which angels eagerly desire to stoop and creep.[13]Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, living abstemiously, hope perfectly upon the grace brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ;[14]As children of obedience, not as formerly conforming yourselves to eager desire in your ignorance:[15]But according to the holy one calling you, also should ye yourselves be holy in all turning back;[16]For it has been written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.[17]And if ye call upon the Father, judging without distinction of persons according to the work of each, in fear be occupied in the time of your sojourning:[18]Knowing that not with corruptible things, silver and gold, were ye redeemed from your vain mode of life transmitted from your fathers.[19]But with precious blood, as of a lamb blameless and spotless, of Christ:[20]Known truly before the foundation of the world, and made manifest in the last times for you,[21]Who by him believing in God, having raised him from the dead, and having given him glory; that your faith and hope should be in God.[22]Having purified your souls in the hearing of the truth by the Spirit to unfeigned brotherly love, out of pure hearts love ye one another cordially:[23]Begotten again, not of corrupted seed, but uncorrupted, by the word of God, living and remaining forever.[24]For all flesh as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.

And he fearing has not been perfected in love.[19]We should love him, for he first loved us.[20]If any say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he not loving his brother whom he has seen, God whom he has not seen, how can he love?[21]And this command have we from him, That he loving God love his brother also.","1John.5":"[1]Everyone believing that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God: and every one loving him having begotten, loves him also begotten of him.[2]In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commands.[3]For this is the love of God, that we keep his commands: and his commands are not heavy.[4]For everything begotten of God conquers the world: and this is the victory having conquered the world, our faith.[5]Who is he conquering the world, if not he believing that Jesus is the Son of God?[6]This is he having come by water and blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water alone, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is testifying, for the Spirit is truth.[7]For three are testifying (in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.[8]And three are testifying in the earth,) the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three are for one.[9]If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater: for this is the testimony of God which he has testified concerning his Son.[10]He believing in the Son of God has the testimony in himself: he not believing God has made him a liar; for he has not believed the testimony which God has testified of his Son.[11]And this is the testimony, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.[12]He having the Son has life; and he not having the Son of God has not life.[13]These I wrote to you believing in the name of the Son of God; ye might know that ye have eternal life, and that ye might believe in the name of the Son of God.[14]And this is the freedom of speech which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us:[15]And if we know that he hear us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.[16]If any see his brother sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask, and sinning will give him life to them sinning not to death. There is a sin to death: I say not of that, that he should ask.[17]All injustice is sin: and there is a sin not to death.[18]We know that every one born of God sins not; but he born of God keeps himself, and evil touches him not.[19]We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in evil.[20]And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding, and we know him true, and we are in him true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.[21]Little children, watch yourselves from idols. Amen.","2John.1":"[1]The elder to the chosen mistress in truth; (and not I only, but also all and to her children, whom I love they having known the truth;)[2]For the truth remaining in us, and shall be with us forever.[3]There shall be with you grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth, and love.[4]I was greatly rejoiced that I found of thy children walking about in the truth, as we received a command from the Father.[5]And now I entreat thee, mistress, not as writing a new command, but what we had from the beginning, that we should love one another.[6]And this is love, that we walk about according to his commands. This is the command, That as ye heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.[7]For many cheats come into the world, they not acknowledging Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the cheat and antichrist.[8]Look to yourselves, lest we should destroy what things we have wrought, but we should receive a full reward.[9]Every one passing by, and not remaining in the teaching of Christ, has not God. He remaining in the teaching of Christ, the same also has the Father and the Son.[10]If there come any to you, and bring not this teaching, receive ye him not into the household, and to rejoice tell him not:[11]For he telling him to rejoice, partakes of his evil works.[12]Having many things to write to you, I was not willing by paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to month, that our joy might be filled up.[13]The children of thy chosen sister greet thee. Amen.","3John.1":"[1]The elder to the dearly beloved Gains, whom I love in truth.[2]Dearly beloved, I pray above all things that thou succeed and be in good health, as thy soul succeeds.[3]For I was greatly rejoiced, the brethren coming and testifying to thy truth, as thou walkest about in the truth.[4]I have no joy greater than these that I hear my children walking in truth.[5]Dearly beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou dost work for the brethren, and for strangers;[6]Who testified to thy love before the church: thou shalt do well, having sent them forward worthily of God.[7]For, for his name went they forth, receiving nothing from the nations.[8]Therefore ought we to receive such, that we might be workers together in the truth.[9]I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, seeking the superiority over them, receives us not.[10]Therefore, if I should come, I will put him in mind of his works which he does, talking silly against us with evil words: and not being satisfied in these, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and hinders those being willing, and casts out of the church.[11]Dearly beloved, imitate not evil, but good. He doing good is of God: and he doing evil has not seen God.[12]It has been testified to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself: and we also testify; and know that our testimony is true.[13]I have many things to write, but I will not by ink and pen write to thee:[14]And I hope presently to see thee, and we will speak mouth to mouth.

and the voice of their wings as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war.[10]And they have tails as scorpions, and goads were in their tails: and their power to injure men five months.[11]And they have a king over them, the angel of the abyss, the name to him in Hebrew Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.[12]One woe has passed; behold, there come two woes more after these.[13]And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet, and I heard one voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,[14]Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels bound in the great river Euphrates.[15]And the four angels were loosed, prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, that they might kill the third of men.[16]And the number of troops of cavalry, two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard their number.[17]And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them sitting upon them, having fiery coats of mail, and of deep purple, and sulphurous: and the horses’ heads as lions’ heads; and out of their mouths went forth fire and smoke and sulphur.[18]By these three were the third of men killed, from fire, and from smoke, and from brimstone, coming forth out of their mouths.[19]For their powers are in their month, and in their tails: for their tails like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure.[20]And the rest of men who were not killed by these blows, neither repented of the works of their hands, that they should not worship evil spirits, and images of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood: which neither can see, neither hear, neither walk:[21]And they repented not of their slaughters, nor of their charms, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.","Rev.10":"[1]And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, surrounded with a cloud: and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:[2]And he had in his hand a small book opened: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth,[3]And he cried with a great voice, as a lion roars: and when he cried, the seven thunders spake their voices.[4]And when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal what the seven thunders spake, and thou mayest not write these.[5]And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon earth lifted up his hand to heaven,[6]And sware by him living for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and all in it, and earth, and all things in it, and the sea, and all in it, that time shall be no more:[7]But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he should be about to sound the trumpet, and the mystery of God should be finished, as he announced the good news to his servants the prophets.[8]And the voice which I heard from heaven again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book opened in the hand of the angel having stood upon the sea and upon the earth.[9]And I came forth to the angel, saying to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take, and eat it up; and it shall render thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth shall it be sweet as honey.[10]And I took the small book from the angel’s hand, and I was eating it; and in my mouth was as honey, sweet: and when I ate it, my belly was bitter.[11]And he says to me, Thou must again prophesy to peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings.","Rev.11":"[1]And a reed was given me like rod: and the messenger stood, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them worshipping in it.[2]And the court-yard that without the temple throw out, and thou mayest not measure it: for it was given to the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months.[3]And I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, surrounded with sackcloth.[4]These are the two olive trees, and the two chandeliers which having stood before the God of the earth.[5]And if any would injure them, fire goes forth out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any would injure them, so must he be put to death.[6]These have power to shut up heaven, that the rain should not wet in the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every blow, as often as they wish.[7]And when they should finish their testimony, the wild beast coming up out of the abyss shall wage war with them, and shall conquer them, and kill them.[8]And their slain bodies upon the spacious way of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.[9]And they from the people and tongues and nations shall see their slain bodies three days and a half, and they shall not suffer their slain bodies to be put into tombs.[10]And they dwelling upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall be gladdened, and shall send gifts to one another; for these two prophets tortured them dwelling upon the earth.[11]And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God came upon them, and they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell upon those beholding them.[12]And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up to heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.[13]And in that hour was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and there were slain in the shaking seven thousand names of men: and the rest were terrified, and they gave glory to the God of heaven.[14]The second woe passed away; behold, the third woe comes swiftly.[15]And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet; and great voices were in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world were our Lord’s, and his Christ’s; and he shall reign for ever and ever.[16]And the twenty four elders, which before God sitting upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,[17]Saying, We return thanks to thee, O Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, who being, and who was, and who coming; for thou hast taken thy great power, and reigned.[18]And the nations were angry, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the holy, and to them fearing thy name, the small and great; and to destroy them destroying the earth.[19]And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and shakings, and great hail.","Rev.12":"[1]And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman surrounded by the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:[2]And having in the womb she cries, having the pains of childbirth, and making trial to bring forth.[3]And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great fiery red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.[4]And his tail draws the third of the stars of heaven, and he cast them into the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, that when she should bring forth he might devour her child.[5]And she brought forth a son, a male, who is about to rule all nations with an iron rod: and her child was snatched up to God, and his throne.[6]And the woman fled into the desert where she has a place prepared from God, that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.[7]And war was in heaven; and Michael and his angels waged war against the dragon; and the dragon waged war and his angels,[8]And were not strong; nor was place more found for them in heaven.[9]And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, he deceiving the whole habitable globe: he was cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.[10]And I heard a great voice saying in heaven, Now was salvation and power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren was cast down, he accusing them before our God, day and night.[11]And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their souls till death.[12]For this rejoice, ye heavens, and they dwelling in them. Woe to them inhabiting the earth and the sea! for the devil came down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.[13]And when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth, he drove out the woman who brought forth the male.[14]And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly to the desert, to her place, where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.[15]And the serpent cast after the woman water out of his mouth as a river, that he might make her torn away by a river.[16]And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed down the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.[17]And the dragon was angry at the woman, and went out to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ.","Rev.13":"[1]And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw coming up from the sea a wild beast, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.[2]And the wild beast which I saw was like a panther, and his feet as of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.[3]And I saw one of his heads as slaughtered to death; and his deathblow was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast.[4]And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the wild beast: and they worshipped the wild beast, saying, Who like the beast? who shall be able to war with him.[5]And a mouth was given him speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given him to make war forty-two months.[6]And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tent, and them dwelling in heaven.[7]And it was given him to make war with the holy, and to conquer them: and power was given him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.[8]And all they dwelling upon earth shall worship him, whose names have not been written in the book of life of the slain Lamb from the foundation of the world.[9]If any have an ear, let him hear.[10]If any bring together to captivity he shall proceed into captivity: if any shall kill with sword, he shall be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the holy.[11]And I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.[12]And all the powers of the first beast he does before him, and he makes the earth and all dwelling in it that they should worship the first wild beast, whose death-blow was healed.[13]And he does great signs, that also he might make fire come down from heaven to the earth before men,[14]And he deceives them dwelling upon earth by the signs which were given him to do before the wild beast; saying to them dwelling upon earth, to make an image to the wild beast, who has the blow of the sword, and he lived.[15]And it was given him to give spirit to the image of the wild beast, that the image of the wild beast might speak, and might make as many as should not worship the image of the wild beast that they be killed.[16]And he makes all, small and great, and rich and poor, and free and servants, that he should give them a stamp upon their right hand, or upon their foreheads:[17]And that no one could buy or sell, except he having the stamp, or the name of the wild beast, or the number of his name.[18]Here is wisdom. Let him having intelligence calculate the number of the wild beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number Six hundred and sixty-six.","Rev.14":"[1]And I saw, and, behold, a Lamb standing upon mount Sion, and with him a hundred forty-four thousand, having the name of his Father written in their foreheads.[2]And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder: and I heard the voice of harp players playing on their harps:[3]And they sing as a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders: and none could learn the song, except the hundred forty-four thousand, purchased from the earth.[4]There are they who were not contaminated by women; for they are virgins. These are they following the Lamb wherever he should lead. These were purchased from men, first fruits to God and the Lamb.[5]And guile was not found in their mouth: for they are blameless before the throne of God.[6]And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the lasting good news to announce to them dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,[7]Saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment has come: and worship ye him having made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.[8]And another angel followed, saying, She fell, Babylon fell, the great city, for all nations has she given to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.[9]And the third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If any worship the wild beast and his image, and receive the stamp upon his forehead, or upon his hand,[10]And the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, mingled pure in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tortured in fire and sulphur before the holy angels, and before the Lamb:[11]And the smoke of their torture goes up forever and ever: and they have no rest day and night, those worshipping the wild beast and his image, and if any receive the stamp of his name.[12]Here is the patience of the holy: here they keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.[13]And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Happy the dead who dying in the Lord from henceforth: Yes, says the Spirit, that they might cease from their fatigues; and their works follow with them.[14]And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud he sitting like the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.[15]And another angel went forth out of the temple, crying with a great voice to him sitting upon the cloud, Send thy sickle, and reap: for the hour has come to thee to reap; for the earth’s harvest was dried up.[16]And he sitting upon the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.[17]And another angel came forth out of the temple which in heaven, the same also having a sharp sickle.[18]And another angel came forth from the altar, having power over fire; and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and harvest the grapes of the vineyard of the earth; for her grapes were fully ripe.[19]And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and harvested the earth’s vineyard, and cast into the great winepress of the wrath of God.[20]And the winepress was trodden under foot without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the horses’ bridles, from sixteen hundred stadia.","Rev.15":"[1]And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last blows; for in them was the wrath of God finished.[2]And I saw as a sea made of glass mingled with fire: and they conquering from the wild beast, and from his image, and from his stamp, and from the number of his name, standing upon the sea made of glass, having harps of God.[3]And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful thy works, O Lord God, Omnipotent Ruler; just and true thy ways, King of the holy.[4]Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou alone holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy justices were made manifest.[5]And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the tent of testimony was opened in heaven:[6]And the seven angels came forth out of the temple, having the seven blows, clothed in linen, pure and shining, and being girded about the breasts with golden girdles.[7]And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, living forever and ever.[8]And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none could come into the temple, till the seven blows of the seven angels were finished.","Rev.16":"[1]And I heard a great voice out of the temple saving to the seven angels, Go forward, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God in the earth.[2]And the first went forth, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and a bad and evil sore was upon the men having the stamp of the wild beast, and them worshipping his image.[3]And the second angel poured out his vial into the sea; and it was blood as of a dead body: and every living soul died in the sea.[4]And the third angel poured out his vial into the rivers, and into the fountains of waters; and it was blood.[5]And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Just, O Lord, art thou, who being, and who was, and who wilt be, for thou didst judge these things.[6]For they poured out the blood of the holy, and of the prophets, and thou didst give them blood to drink; for they are worthy.[7]And I heard another from the altar saying, Yes, O Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, true and just thy judgments.[8]And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and it was given him to parch up men with fire.[9]And men were parched up with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, having power over these blows: and they repented not to give him glory.[10]And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the wild beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they pressed their tongues for pain,[11]And they blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores, and they repented not of their work.[12]And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings of the risings of the sun might be prepared.[13]And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the wild beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.[14]For they are the spirits of demons, doing signs, to go out upon all the kings of the earth and of the whole habitable globe, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Omnipotent Ruler.[15]“Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn’t walk naked, and they see his shame.”[16]And he gathered them together in a place called in Hebrew Armageddon.[17]And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and a great voice went out from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.[18]And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great shaking, such as was not since the time men were upon earth, such a great shaking.[19]And the great city was in three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.[20]And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.[21]And great hail, as the weight of a talent, comes down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the blow of the hail; for its blow is exceedingly great.","Rev.17":"[1]And one of the seven angels having the seven vials, came and spake with me, saying to me, Come; I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot sitting upon many waters:[2]With whom the kings of the earth were debauched, and they dwelling upon the earth were intoxicated from the wine of her harlotry.[3]And he brought me away in the spirit into the desert: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet wild beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.[4]And the woman surrounded with purple and scarlet, and covered with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurity of her harlotry:[5]And upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.[6]And I saw the woman intoxicated from the blood of the holy, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus: and I wondered, seeing her, with great wonder.[7]And the angel said to me, Why didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast lifting her up, having seven heads and ten horns.[8]The wild beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up from the abyss, and go forward to perdition: and they dwelling upon the earth shall wonder, whose names have not been written upon the book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the wild beast that was, and is not, although he is.[9]Here the mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sits upon them.[10]And there are seven kings: five fell, and one is; the other has not yet come; and when he should come, he must remain a little.[11]And the wild beast which was, and is not, and this is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes forward into perdition.[12]And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which took not yet the kingdom; but take power as kings one hour with the beast.[13]These have one purpose, and their power and authority will they transmit to the wild beast.[14]These will wage war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they with him called, and chosen, and faithful.[15]And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.[16]And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the wild beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and they shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire.[17]For God gave to their hearts to do his purpose, and to do one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the wild beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.[18]And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, having kingdom over the kings of the earth.","Rev.18":"[1]And after these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was enlightened from his glory.[2]And he cried with a great, strong voice, saying, She fell, Babylon the great fell, and became the dwelling of devils, and the prison of every unclean spirit, and the prison of every unclean and detested bird.[3]For of the wrath of the wine of her fornication have all nations drunk, and the kings of the earth were debauched with her, and the wholesale merchants of the earth were rich from the power of her luxury.[4]And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye partake not of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.[5]For her sins were followed even to heaven, and God remembered her injustices.[6]Give back to her as also she gave back to you, and double to her double things according to her works: in the cup in which she mixed, mix to her double.[7]As much as she glorified herself, and led an insolent life, give her so much torture and grief: for in her heart she says, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and I should see no grief.[8]Therefore in one day shall her blows come, death, and grief, and famine; and she shall be burned down in fire: for strong the Lord God judging her.[9]And weep for her, and lament over her, shall the kings of the earth having been debauched with her, and having led an insolent life, when they see the smoke of her burning,[10]Standing from far off for fear of her torture, saying, Woe, woe, the great city Babylon, the strong city!

for in one hour was so great riches laid waste.[17]And every pilot, and all the crowd upon ships, and the sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood from far off,[18]And cried, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What like the great city![19]And they cast earth upon their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, in which all having ships in the sea were rich by her value! for in one hour was she rendered a desert.[20]Rejoice over her, O heaven, and the holy sent, and the prophets; for God judged your judgment of her.[21]And one strong angel lifted up a stone as a great millstone, and cast into the sea, saying, Thus with excitement shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and be found no more.[22]And the voice of harp players, and musicians, and flute players, and trumpeters, should be heard in thee no more; and every artist of every art be found no more in thee; and the voice of the millstone should be heard no more in thee;[23]And the light of the lamp no more should shine in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, should no more be beard in thee: for thy wholesale merchants were leaders of the earth: for with thy charms were all nations led astray.[24]And in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of the holy, and of all those slain upon the earth.","Rev.19":"[1]And after these things I heard the great voice of a vast multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, to the Lord our God:[2]For true and just his judgments: for he judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her harlotry, and he avenged the blood of his servants from her hand.[3]And the second time they said, Alleluia. And her smoke goes up for ever and ever.[4]And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell and worshipped God sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.[5]And a voice from the throne came out, saying, Praise our God, all his servants, and they fearing him, also small and great.[6]And I heard as the voice of the vast multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of powerful thunders, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, reigned.[7]Let us rejoice, and be transported with joy, and let us give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb came, and his wife prepared herself.[8]And it was given her that she put on fine linen, pure and shining: for fine linen is the justification of the holy.[9]And he says to me, Write, Happy they called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true words of God.[10]And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See, not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren having the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.[11]And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he sitting upon him called Faithful and True, and in justice he judges and makes war.[12]And his eyes as a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems; having a name written, which no one knows, except himself.[13]And surrounded with a garment dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.[14]And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.[15]And out of his mouth went forth a sharp sword, that with it he might strike the nations: and he shall rule them with an iron rod: and he treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath and anger of God, the Omnipotent Ruler.[16]And he has upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.[17]And I saw one angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves to the supper of the great God;[18]That ye might eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains of thousands, and the flesh of the strong, and the flesh of horses, and of them sitting upon them, and the flesh of all, free and servants, and of small and great.[19]And I saw the wild beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to war with him sitting upon the horse, and with his army.[20]And the wild beast was seized, and with him the false prophet having done signs before him, with which he deceived them having received the stamp of the wild beast, and them worshipping his image. Living, were they two cast into the lake of fire burning with sulphur.[21]And the rest were killed by the sword of him sitting upon the horse, coming out of his mouth: and all birds were satiated from their flesh.","Rev.20":"[1]And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.[2]And he seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,[3]And he cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and affixed a seal above him, that he should no more deceive the nations, until the thousand years be finished: and after these things he must be loosed a little time.[4]And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given them: and the souls of them beheaded with an axe for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who worshipped not the wild beast, nor his image, and took not the stamp upon their foreheads, and upon their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.[5]And the rest of the dead returned not again to life even till the thousand years be finished.

This is the second death.[15]And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.","Rev.21":"[1]And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and first earth passed away; and the sea was no more.[2]And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.[3]And I heard a great voice from heaven saying, Behold the tent of God with men, and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God.[4]And God shall wipe out every tear from their eyes; and death be no more, neither grief, neither crying, nor trouble shall be more: for the first things departed.[5]And he sitting upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.[6]And he said to me, It has been. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him thirsting of the fountain of the water of life gratuitously.[7]He conquering shall inherit all things; and I will be God to him, and he shall be son to me.[8]But to the cowardly, and unbelieving, and to the abominable, and murderers, and to fornicators, and charmers, and to idolaters, and to all the lying, their part in the lake burning with fire and sulphur: which is the second death,[9]And there came to me one of the seven angels having the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.[10]And he brought me away in the spirit upon a mountain great and high, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,[11]Having the glory of God: and her luminary like a most precious stone, as jasper stone, shining like crystal;[12]And having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and the names inscribed, which are of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:[13]From the sunrising three gates; from the north three gates; from the south three gates; and from the sun-setting three gates.[14]And the wall of the city having twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve sent of the Lamb.[15]And he speaking with me had a golden reed that he might measure the city, and her gates, and her wall.[16]And the city lies quadrangular, and her length is so large, such also the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, at twelve thousand stadia. Her length, breadth, and height are equal.[17]And he measured her wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, which is the angel.[18]And the interior construction of her wall was a jasper: and the city pure gold, like pure crystal.[19]And the foundations of the wall of the city adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation a jasper; the second, a sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald:[20]The fifth, a sardonyx; the sixth, a sardius; the seventh, a chrysolyte; the eighth, a beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a hyacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.[21]And the twelve gates twelve pearls; each one of the gates was of one pearl: and the broad way of the city pure gold, as transparent amber.[22]And a temple saw I not in her: for the Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, is the temple and the Lamb.[23]And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they shine in her: for the glory of God enlightened her, and her light the Lamb.[24]And the nations of the saved shall walk about in her light: and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into her.[25]And her gates should not be shut by day: for no night shall be there.[26]And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into her.[27]And there came not into her anything common, and any doing abomination, and a lie: but they written in the book of life of the Lamb.","Rev.22":"[1]And he showed me the pure river of the water of life, shining as crystal, going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.[2]In the midst of her broad way and of the river, hence and thence, the tree of life, making twelve fruits, in a month each one returning its fruit: and the leaves of the tree for the cure of the nations.[3]And there shall be no more curse: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in her; and his servants shall serve him:[4]And they shall see his face; and his name upon their foreheads.[5]And night shall not be there; and they have no need of a lamp, and the light of the sun; for the Lord God shall enlighten them: and they shall reign for ever and ever.[6]And he said to me, These words faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants what must be with speed.[7]Behold, I come quickly: happy he keeping the words of the prophecy of this book.[8]And I John seeing these things, and hearing. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel pointing out to me these things.[9]And he says to me, See, not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them keeping the words of the prophecy of this book; worship God.[10]And he says to me, Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is near.[11]He being unjust, let him be unjust yet: and he being filthy, let him be filthy yet: and the just, let him do justice yet: and the holy, let him be holy yet.[12]And behold, I come swiftly; and my reward with me, to give back to each as shall be his work.[13]I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.[14]Happy they doing his commands, that their power shall be in the tree of life, and they might come in at the gates to the city.[15]And without, dogs, and charmers and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one loving and doing a lie.[16]I Jesus sent mine angel to testify these things to you, to the churches. I am the root and stock of David, the shining and morning star.[17]And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him hearing say, Come. And let him thirsting come. And let him wishing, take the water of life freely.[18]For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this book, If any add to these things, God will add to him the blows written in this book:[19]And if any take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the book of life, and from the holy city, and from the things written in this book.[20]He testifying says, Yes, I come swiftly. Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus.[21]The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen."}
