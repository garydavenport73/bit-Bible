Horses were such natural and familiar tokens of royal state (not being employed in agriculture or for travelling), that the Hebrew kings were warned (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) against multiplying them. Outrunners again, such as the Roman emperors had (called by them <span class="accented">cursores</span>), and such as we find at the present day in Egypt, <span class="accented">footmen</span> who precede the chariot at full speed, and by their shrill cries clear the way, are admirably calculated to impress the public mind.

He could hardly be unconscious that under a new reign his position - unless he took measures to assure it - would be a precarious one. He resolved, therefore, to secure himself by helping Adonijah to his throne. It is also highly probable that Adonijah's ambitious character was much more to his liking than that of the pious and pacific Solomon. Adonijah's physical qualities, again, would no doubt commend him to this rough soldier, who may also have sympathised with him as the eldest son.

May we not find one in jealousy of Zadok, who had for some time been associated with him in the priesthood, who is generally mentioned first (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-29.htm">2 Samuel 15:29, 35, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). as if he were the more important and influential, and whose advancement, after the prophecy of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33-36</a>, Abiathar could not contemplate without suspicion and dread.

It is generally said to be difficult to explain "how Zadok and Abiathar came  both to be "priests at this time." Rawlinson, who adds that "the best explanation is that Abiathar was the real high priest," officiating in Zion, while Zadok acted as chief priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon. (Bahr, by a strange oversight, assigns to Zadok the care of the ark on Mount Zion, whereas <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>, distinctly connects his ministry with the tabernacle of witness at Gibeon.) But the precedence (see on ver. 7) generally assigned to Zadok is hardly consistent with the idea that Abiathar was "the real high priest." The fact is that a duality of high priests, associated, apparently, on pretty equal terms, was not unknown in Jewish history. The cases of Eleazer and Ithamar, Hophni and Phinehas, Annas and Caiaphas, will occur to all. <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, speaks of "the chief priest" and "the second priest;" <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10</a>, of the "chief priest of the house of Zadok." And a dual priesthood would be the more necessary in David's days, because of the two sanctuaries, Zion and Gibeon. We find, however, from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>, that Zadok was already priest at the time of the bringing up of the ark. And the true explanation, no doubt, is that Zadok had succeeded some member of his family, in all probability Jehoiada, called in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>, "the leader of Aaron" (Hebrews), who had certainly been high priest in the time of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>), and who would hardly be degraded when, with 3700 followers, he joined David at Hebron. On his decease, or cession of orifice, Zadok, who had joined at the same time with a large contingent,was associated with Abiathar in the priest's office.

Their use, consequently, was naturally restricted to royal or distinguished personages (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>).

Where was Gihon? The popular belief (accepted by Bahr and Keil, as well as by some geographers) is that it was in the valley of the Son of Hinnom, a part of which still bears the name of Gihon, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the west of Jerusalem, and not far from the Jaffa gate. By many indeed the present <span class="accented">Birket-es-Sultan</span> is identified with the Lower Pool of Gihon. But others (Ferguson, Rawlinson, etc.) see in it the ancient name of the Tyropaeon. Scripture does not speak of it as a <span class="accented">spring</span>, though the "source of the waters of Gihon" is mentioned <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>, Hebrews The text shows that it was <span class="accented">below</span> the city ("bring him <span class="accented">down</span> upon Gihon," ver. 33. Cf. also ver. 40). <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>, speaks of "Gihon in the valley," where it is very noticeable that the word used is <span class="accented">Nachal</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Wady, watercourse). But this "is the word always employed for the valley of the Kedron, east of Jerusalem, the so called valley of Jehoshaphat; <span class="accented">ge</span> (ravine or glen) being as constantly employed for the valley of Hinnom, south and west of the town" (Grove," Dict. Bible," art. Gihon). It is also to be noticed that the text last cited mentions Gihon in connection with Ophel, which lies southeast of Jerusalem.. The Chald., Arab., and Syr. are probably right, therefore, in identifying Gihon here with <span class="accented">Siloam</span> (which lies at the foot of Ophel), in favour of which it may further be said that it would be admirably suited for David's purpose - of a counter demonstration - and that whether En-Rogel is to be found at the Well of the Virgin or the Well of Job. Siloam is at no great distance from either, and quite within earshot, whereas the traditional Gihon is altogether out of the way. It must be borne in mind that this procession to and from Gihon was ordained, not because there was any special reason for anointing Solomon there ? for it was not a holy place - but purely as a demonstration to the populace, and to checkmate the conspirators. It was probably a public place, and would accommodate a large concourse (Poole).

But while their functions are pretty well understood, great difference of opinion exists as to the origin or meaning of the words. By some they are supposed to be <span class="accented">Gentile</span> names. A tribe of Cherethites is mentioned <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>. (Cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>), and in close connexion with the Philistines (ver. 16). Hence Cherethite has been thought to be another name for Philistine; and as the LXX. and Syr. render the word "Cretans," it has been conjectured that the Philistines had their origin from Crete. They did come from Caphtor, and that is probably Crete (see <a href="../../par/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> again, is not unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> In favor of this view is the fact that David certainly had a bodyguard of foreign mercenaries (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>, where the "Gittites" are connected with the Cherethites). Nor does it make against it that "two designations" would thus "be employed side by side for one and the same people" - as if we should speak of Britons and Englishmen (Bahr). For the names look like a <span class="accented">paronomasia</span> - of which the Jews were very fond - and a trick of this kind would at once account for the tautology. [Since writing this, I find the same idea has already occurred to Ewald.] But the other view, adopted by Gesenius, is that the names are names of office and function.
