Rawlinson conjectures that it was during this period that the Assyrian invasion, under Shalmaneser II., took place.

Ahab was unable to contend single-handed, and without Divine assistance - which he could not now look for - against Syria; and saw no means of compelling the execution of the treaty which Ben-hadad had made with him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>), and which he appears to have shamelessly broken, except by the help of Jehoshaphat, whose military organizetion at this time must have been great, and, indeed, complete (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10-19</a>). It is in favour of this view that Ahab entertained him and his large retinue with such profuse hospitality.

Probably Ben-hadad, when he besieged Samaria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), had formed the idea of reducing the whole of Palestine to subjection. And Jehoshaphat would remember that Ramoth-Gilead, where the Syrian king was still  entrenched, was but forty miles distant from Jerusalem. Bahr holds that horses are specially mentioned "because they formed an essential part of the military power" (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). It is true that in a campaign against the Syrians they would be especially useful (see on 1 Kings 20:1.); but they receive no mention at the hands of the chronicler, who reads instead of this last clause, "And we (or I) will be with thee in the war."]

Others have supposed that they were prophets of Baal. But both these suppositions are negatived <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the fact that Jehoshaphat asks Ahab to "inquire at the word of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that these prophets profess to speak in the name and by the Spirit of Jehovah (vers. 11, 12, 24). Moreover <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ahab would hardly have insulted Jehoshaphat by bringing the prophets of Baal or Astarte before him (Waterland in Wordsworth).

The only conclusion open to us, consequently - and it is now generally adopted - is that they were the priests of the high places of Bethel and Dan, the successors of those whom Jeroboam had introduced into the priestly office. It need cause us no surprise to find these priests here described as "prophets" (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1</a>), and as claiming prophetic gifts, for the priests of Baal bore the same name (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19, 22</a>, etc.), and apparently pretended to similar powers. "No ancient people considered any cultus complete without a class of men through whom the god might be questioned" (Bahr). The existence of so large a number of prophets of the calves proves that the inroads of idolatry had by no means destroyed the calf worship.

It was probably this circumstance excited Jehoshaphat's suspicions. It has been said that the reason why he was dissatisfied with this answer is unexplained; but when we remember how careful the true prophet was to speak in the name of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-7.htm">1 Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13, 14, 28</a>), we can hardly doubt that it was their mention of "Adonai "occasioned his misgivings.

The question was insincere; the reply was ironical (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>). Ahab is answered "according to the multitude of his idols" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>). He wishes to be deceived, and he is deceived. No doubt Micaiah's mocking tone showed that his words were ironical; but Ahab's hollow tone had already proved to Micaiah that he was insincere; that he did not care to know the will of the Lord, and wanted prophets who would speak to him smooth things and prophesy deceits (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>).]

This may be an "empty Rabbinical tradition" (Bahr), but we may be sure that Ahab did not hear Micaiah's words unmoved.

We can hardly doubt that Jehoshaphat at least would have been well content to abandon the expedition. After the solicitude he had manifested for the sanction of one of the prophets of Jehovah, and after that the one who had been consulted had predicted the defeat of the army, the king of Judah must have had re,my misgivings. But it is not difficult to understand why, notwithstanding his fears, he did not draw back. For, in the first place, he had committed himself to the war by the rash and positive promise of ver. 4. In the next place, he was Ahab's guest, and had been sumptuously entertained by him, and it would therefore require some moral courage to extricate himself from the toils in which he was entangled. Moreover he would have subjected himself to the imputation of cowardice had he deserted his ally because of a prophecy which threatened the latter with death. The people around him, again, including perhaps his own retinue, were possessed with the spirit of battle, and treated the prophecy of Micaiah with contempt, and it would be difficult for him to swim alone against the current. It is probable, too, that he discounted the portentous words of Micaiah on account of the long. standing quarrel between him and Ahab. And, finally, we must remember that his own interests were threatened by Syria, and he may well have feared trouble from that quarter in case this war were abandoned. Rawlinson suggests that he may have conceived a personal affection for Ahab; but <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a> affords but slender ground for this conclusion.]

It is hardly likely that such intelligence could be brought by spies, and there would be no deserters from the Syrian army to that of the Jews. It is enough to remember that Micaiah's words, "these have no master," could not fail to awaken come alarm in his bosom, especially when connected with the prophecy of <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>. He will not betray his fear by keeping out of the fray - which, indeed, he could not do without abdicating one of the principal functions of the king (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), and without exposing himself to the charge of cowardice; but under the circumstances he thinks it imprudent to take the lead of the army, as kings were wont to do (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>), in his royal robes.

If this LXX. interpretation could be maintained it would lend some colour to the supposition, otherwise destitute of basis, that Ahab by this arrangement was plotting the death of Jehoshaphat in order that he might incorporate Judah into his own kingdom. It is clear, however, that Ahab then had other work on his hands,  and it is doubtful whether even he was capable of such a pitch of villainy. What he means is, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Syrians have a personal enmity against himself (ver. 81), whereas they could have none against the king of Judah; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Jehoshaphat's life had not been threatened as his own had.

But it is impossible to see in Ahab's generous conduct towards him a sufficient reason for the fierce hatred which these words disclose. It is much more probable that some affront had subsequently been offered to the Syrian monarch, possibly in the shape of the reproaches which Ahab may have addressed to him on account of his retention of Ramoth-Gilead, and the gross violation of the treaty of <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>.

That it was a cry for Divine help is the most probable, because it is almost an instinct, especially with a pious soul like Jehoshaphat, to cry to God in the moment of danger. That he had doubts as to whether the course he was pursuing was pleasing to God, would make him all the more ready to cry aloud for mercy the moment he found himself in peril.

His back was not turned to them, as he had desired. The idea that he was in any way fighting against the Syrians is altogether foreign to the text. It is at first sight somewhat difficult to reconcile this statement with the direction given to the charioteer in the preceding verse, and some have been led, though without sufficient warrant, to conclude that Ahab left the field, had he wound bound up, and then returned to take his part in the battle. But the explanation is very simple. As the battle increased, it became impossible to comply with the king's desire. So thick was the fight that retreat was impossible. Hence the wounded king, who would otherwise have sunk down to the bottom of the chariot, had to be "stayed up in the presence of the Syrians." This circumstance may also account for the fact that he died at even. Had it been possible to remove him and staunch his wounds, he might have lingered for some time. As it was, he bled to death. It is not clear, therefore, that "his death was kingly" (Kitto), or that we must concede to Ahab "the credit of right princely fortitude on this occasion" (Rawlinson). He would have left the host could he have done so. It was his set-rants propped up the dying man in his chariot, to encourage the army.
