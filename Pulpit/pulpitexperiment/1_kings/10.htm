But the kingdoms of Sheba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Saba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) are entirely distinct (<a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>), the latter being the name both of the capital and country of Meroe, a province of Ethopia (Joshua, Ant. 2:10. 2); while the former in like manner designates both the chief city and also the kingdom of the Sabeans (<a href="../../par/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>). This tribe would seem to have grown richer and stronger than all the other Arabian peoples by means of its commercial enterprise, and it was especially famed for its gold, gems, and spices (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>). It is noticeable that in both kingdoms government by female sovereigns was not uncommon (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>); but it is very remarkable to find any country under the rule of a queen at this early date. (The idea that either of these lands was <span class="accented">always</span> governed by queens has no real basis.)

This particular present was doubtless brought by the queen because she had heard of the extensive use made of it by Solomon, and of the enormous quantities he required.

That is to say, in addition to the fitting presents which he made in return for her gifts, he freely gave her whatsoever she asked for. To ask for a coveted thing is no breach of Oriental propriety. The Ethiopian Christians find in these words (and considering the character of Solomon and the license of that age, perhaps not altogether without reason) a basis for their belief that she bore Solomon a son, Melimelek by name, from whom, indeed, the present sovereigns of Abyssinia claim to derive their descent.] <span class="cmt_word">So</span> <span class="cmt_word">she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</span> Bishop Wordsworth has remarked (p. 44) that the record of this visit disappoints us.

"In like manner," he adds, "we hear nothing of any attempt on Solomon's part to improve his friendship and commercial relations with Hiram into an occasion for communicating the better merchandise of Divine truth to the Sidonians." But surely this criticism overlooks the fact that Judaism was not a missionary religion, and that the chosen people had no sort of commission to convert the heathen, It is, no doubt, a mystery; but it is a fact, that for 2,000 years the light of God's truth was, by the counsel and purpose of God, restricted within the extremely narrow confines of Israel, and that the "fulness of the time," when the Gentiles should be "fellow heirs," was distant from Solomon's day by a whole millennium., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 10:14-29. SOLOMON'S WEALTH, POMP, AND POWER. The visit of the Queen of Sheba, in itself a striking proof of the fame and greatness of Solomon, is followed by a description of his revenues, his throne, and various other particulars of his wealth and magnificence, some of which are related here because they were the products of the voyages of that same fleet which had been the means of acquainting the queen with Solomon and his glory.

It is possible, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the number of the beast is a reminiscence of this number of talents. For we may surely see in this statement of Solomon's prodigious wealth an indication of his worldliness, the turning point, perhaps, in his estrangement from God. "The love of money" may have been the root of all his evil. It is certainly remarkable that from this time forward his career is one of steady declension. It is also remarkable that while he is here represented to us as a "royal merchant," the mark of the beast is on the <span class="accented">buyers</span> and <span class="accented">sellers</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-17.htm">Revelation 13:17</a>). But see "Expositor," May, 1881. It is, of course, possible that the number has been corrupted, but, on the other hand, it may have been recorded, partly because of the singularity of the sum total. The 666 talents include the receipts from all sources - taxes, tribute, and voyages - with the exception made presently (ver. 15). Rawlinson quotes Keil (in his earlier edition) as estimating this amount at &pound;3,646,350. But in his later work, Keil puts it in round numbers at two and a half millions (17,000,000 thalers), while Mr. Peele calculates it at about &pound;8,000,000. These widely varying figures are instructive, as showing that both estimates are little more than guesswork. We do not know the value of the Hebrew talent, nor, indeed, can it ever be rightly appraised until we know its purchasing power. The <span class="accented">denarius, e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, is generally valued at 8&frac12; d. (or 7&frac12; d.) because it contained some 58 grains of pure silver but its real <span class="accented">value</span> was nearer three shillings, inasmuch as it was a fair wage for a day's work on the land (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>).

Keil: "the kings of the mixed population" (mentioned <a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>. Cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>). Perhaps the words are best explained by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>: "The kings of Arabia (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) and ... of the mingled people (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>) that dwell in the desert," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the desert of <span class="accented">Arabia deserta</span>, bordering on Palestine.

No doubt these kings, who were great sheepmasters, paid their tribute in flocks of sheep and goats (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and of the governors of the country.</span> [The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. ch. 20:24) is a foreign word, perhaps Sanskrit, apparently borrowed by the Jews from the Persians. It is used of Tatnai (<a href="../../par/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>), of Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>), and of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>). Probably our author, in whose day it was a familiar and well understood word, substituted it for some older Hebrew designation. But the office and character of these "governors" is more difficult to define than the name. Rawlinson thinks that, in some parts of the empire, the kings - the "empire of Solomon," he observes, "was in the main a <span class="accented">congeries</span> of small kingdoms" - "had been superseded by governors." But it seems as natural to understand the term of the twelve prefects mentioned in chap. 4, who were "the governors of the land," or of similar officers in the different outposts of the kingdom. We know that the contributions which passed through their hands were furnished <span class="accented">in kind</span>; hence, perhaps, it is that this income is distinguished from the gold of ver. 14.

Rawlinson infers from the <span class="accented">weight</span> that the shields were only plated (shields were commonly made of wood, covered with leather). But whether they were solid or not does not decide the question whether the gold was pure or alloyed. "Shields of gold" are mentioned <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; 1 Macc. 6:39]: six hundred shekels [Heb. omits <span class="accented">shekels</span>, as elsewhere, <a href="../../par/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, etc. There were apparently two kinds of shekel, the Mosaic and the royal (for the latter see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>). The former was twice as much as the latter, but there is no agreement amongst commentators as to the weight or value of either. Nor can we be certain which is indicated here. Thenius decides for the former, and estimates the weight of the gold on each target to be 17 &frac12; lbs., and the value to be 6000 thalers (&pound;900), or, according to Keil, 5000 thalers (&pound;750). Keil, however, inclines to the belief that the royal shekel is meant, in which case the weight would be 9 lbs., and the value about &pound;400. Bahr, however, estimates the gold at no more than &pound;78 (523 thalers)] of gold went to one target.

In Rome the temple of Bellona was studded with them. In Athens, the round marks where they hung can still be traced on the walls of the Parthenon. There were also arms hung round the wails of the second temple (Jos., Ant. 15:11.3)," Stanley. It is supposed that along with those made by Solomon were hung the shields taken by David from the Syrians, as according to <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>, LXX., these latter also were carried off by Shishak. It has been inferred from <a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a> that these also were 500 in number, and that the entire thousand were suspended on a part of the house of the forest of Lebanon known as the Tower of David; cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>]. The historian now proceeds to describe the great feature of another of Solomon's palaces. As the house of the forest of Lebanon was distinguished by the golden shields which emblazoned and glorified its walls, so was "the porch of judgment" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-7.htm">1 Kings 7:7</a>) by the chryselephantine throne.

Most commentators assume that there were fourteen, and the text will certainly bear that construction. But it is altogether more likely that there were twelve; that is to say, that the two lions on the topmost step are the two mentioned in the preceding verse as "standing beside the stays," otherwise there would have been four lions on that step. And we all know that <span class="accented">twelve</span> had a significance such as could not attach to any other number (Bahr, Symbolik, 1:201-205; 2:133, 423). It would signify that all the tribes had an interest in the royal house (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>); and a right of approach to the throne (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>). The lion, a familiar emblem of sovereignty among many nations, had an especial appropriateness in this case, as being the symbol of the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>). We are to see in them partly "symbols of the ruler's authority" (Keil), and partly, perhaps, they represented the twelve tribes as guardians of the throne. "The king mounted between figures of lions to his seat on the throne, and sat between figures of lions upon it" (Wordsworth). Thrones somewhat similar to this in character, but much less magnificent, are represented on the Assyrian monuments.

This immense quantity of gold is quite paralleled in the accounts of profane writers. "Sardanapalus, when Nineveh was besieged, had 150 golden bedsteads, 150 golden tables, a million talents of gold, ten times as much silver, etc. (Ctesias, ap. Athenaeus, 12. p. 29).

Keil and Bahr contend that there was Out one fleet, first, because there is no mention of a second fleet at <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>, and, secondly, because the cargoes were practically the same. I incline (with Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al</span>.) to think there were two separate navies, for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The expression "navy of Tarshish" (in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">2 Chronicles 9:21</a> expanded into "ships <span class="accented">going to</span> Tarshish," which Keil and Bahr are compelled to set aside as a mistake on the part of the writer), taken in connexion with the following words, "with (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">together with, as well as</span>) the navy of Hiram" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as we conclude from ver. 11, the navy <span class="accented">manned</span>, or, it may be, <span class="accented">owned</span>, by Hiram) points to a separate fleet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the cargoes, so far from being the same, strike me as being altogether diverse. The Ophir fleet brought in "gold, almug trees, and precious stones." The navy of Tarshish "gold and silver ivory, apes, and peacocks." See below. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Even if we understand here by the "navy of Hiram" a Phoenician fleet, still a second fleet is indicated. But this leads us to consider the destination of these ships. The term, "fleet of Tarshish," does not in itself prove anything, for the expression, "ships of Tarshish," is almost a synonym for "merchant vessels." In <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a> we read, "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish <span class="accented">to go to Ophir</span>," and they "were broken at Ezion-geber" (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). It is probable that in Jewish lips the words were a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> for all vessels going long voyages  (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; compare our "East Indiaman," "Greenlander"). But the words "in the sea," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, are most naturally understood of that ocean which the Jews called <span class="accented">par excellence</span> "the sea," or "the great sea" (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6, 7</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Mediterranean, though the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> is undoubtedly used of the Red Sea, the Sea of Galilee, and the Dead Sea. And the more so as we know that the Tyrians had an extensive commerce with Tartessus, which was a great emporium of trade from the earliest times. Bahr objects that "no gold is found in Spain, but few peacocks, and little ivory;" but Rawlinson, on the other hand, affirms that "Spain had the richest silver mines known in the ancient world, and had a good deal of gold also" (Plin., Nat. Hist. 3:4), while "apes and ivory were produced by the opposite coast of Africa" (Herod. 4:191. As to peacocks see below). And it is a powerful argument in favour of Tartessus that it is the plentifulness of <span class="accented">silver</span> in Solomon's days has suggested this reference to the fleet. For though silver "was found in the land of the Nabataeans, according to Strabo, 16:784" (Keil), yet it was to Tartessus that the ancient world was chiefly indebted for its supplies of that metal. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that second fleet, trading with the Mediterranean seaports, is here described. And <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a> is distinctly in favour of this conclusion. When Ewald says ("Hist. Israel," 3:263) that the Phoenicians would hardly tolerate a rival in the Mediterranean, he surely forgets that they had been admitted by the Jews to share the trade of Ophir] <span class="cmt_word">with the navy of Hiram; once in three years</span> [This period agrees better with a voyage to Spain than to Southern Arabia. And if we understand it of Spanish voyages, it removes one difficulty in the way of placing Ophir in Arabia. It has also been urged that "the Hebrews reckoned parts of years and days as whole ones" (Kitte); but this hardly would apply to the expression "once in three years"] <span class="cmt_word">came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver ivory</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">tooth of elephants</span>, LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. It is noteworthy that the name for elephant used here is derived from the Sanskrit (Gesen.), and an argument has been drawn hence in favour of placing Ophir in India, and of identifying the Tarshish fleet with the navy of Ophir. But such conclusions are extremely precarious. The name may have first come to the Jews from India, in which case it would be retained, from whatever quarter the commodity was subsequently derived. See Rawlinson, p. 546], and apes [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>is in like manner identified by Gesenius, <span class="accented">al</span>., with the Sanskrit <span class="accented">kapi</span>. Sir J. Emerson Tennant ("Ceylon," 2 p 102) says "the terms by which these articles (ivory, apes, and peacocks) are designated in the Hebrew Scriptures are identical with the Tamil names by which some of them are called in Ceylon to the present day"], <span class="cmt_word">and peacocks.</span> [So the the ancients interpret the original word, though some of the moderns would understand "parrots."

Whether it was also found in Africa is uncertain. Aristophanes (Birds, 485) says, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Wordsworth very justly sees in the mention of these curious beasts and birds a symptom of declension in simplicity and piety, a token that "wealth had brought with it luxury and effeminacy, and a frivolous, vainglorious love for novel and outlandish objects.'

It may perhaps be said that this force was necessary to keep the tributary kings in due subjection. But it seems quite as likely that it was maintained largely for the sake of pomp and display.

It was esteemed both for its fruit and its wood, so much so that David appointed a steward to have the supervision both of "the olive trees and the sycamore trees in the Shefelah" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-28.htm">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>). The sycamores of Egypt, which were used for the coffins of mummies (Dict.

Conder ("Tent-work," p. 5) describes it as "consisting of low hills, about five hundred feet above the sea, of white soft limestone," and adds that "the broad valleys among these hills...  produce fine crops of corn, and on the hills the long olive groves flourish better than in other districts" - an incidental and valuable confirmation of the text.

"And the <span class="accented">company</span> of kings' merchants took the <span class="accented">company</span> (of horses) at a price." The great difficulty in the way of this interpretation is perhaps the paronomasia, which, though not altogether without precedent, would be formal and unusual in grave history. Somewhat similarly Bahr: "and as to horses... and their collection, the merchants of the king made a collection for a certain price," but this again is strained and artificial. Perhaps it is safer to see in the word the name of a place. The LXX. (similarly the Vulgate) renders, "from Egypt <span class="accented">and from Thekoa</span>," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, which Keil, however, contends is manifestly a variation of an older reading, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">from</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;</span>." As to Koa or Kova, it is objected that no such place is mentioned elsewhere, and it is alleged that if it were a market for horses, or even if it were a frontier station, where the duties on horses were collected, we should surely have heard of it again. But this is by no means certain. Koa may well have been an in. significant post on the frontier which it was only necessary to mention in this connexion. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span> certainly looks like an emendation, but it is to be remembered that although Tekoa (<a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) was apparently an insignificant village, still it gave its name to a district; it was no great distance from the Egyptian frontier - it was some six Roman miles south of Bethlehem, according to Jerome (<span class="accented">in Amos</span>, Proem.), and it may have been the rendezvous of the Egyptian and Hebrew horse dealers. The text would thus yield the following meaning: "And as for the expert of Solomon's horses from Egypt and from Koa (or Tekoa), the king's merchants took them from Koa (or Tekoa) at a price."

The word is probably used somewhat loosely of the semi-independent tribes bordering on Palestine, the <span class="accented">Khatti</span> of the Assyrian inscriptions (Dict.

It is a curious coincidence that we find horses and chariots associated in popular estimation with the Hittites, at a later period of the history (<a href="../../par/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). Nor are we justified in supposing that these horses and chariots were furnished as cavalry to "Solomon's vassals, whose armies were at his disposal, if he required their aid" (Rawlinson), for the kings of Syria are mentioned presently, and some of these at least were enemies to Solomon. Probably all we are to understand is that neighbouring nations received their supply of horses from Egypt - the home of horses and chariots (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2-4</a>) - largely through the instrumentality of Solomon's merchants], <span class="cmt_word">and for the kings of Syria</span> ["who became the bitterest enemies of Israel" (Wordsworth): one fruit of a worldly policy], did they bring them out by their means.
