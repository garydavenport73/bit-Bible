It rather shows that so little did he meditate evil that he accepted the refusal of Naboth as conclusive, and gave way to childish grief.

And the following considerations will show that the discrepancy is only apparent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence here pronounced against Ahab was, on his repentance, stayed in its execution.

The repentance of Ahab, having secured him immunity from this sentence, his subsequent folly and sin (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>) nevertheless brought down upon him a judgment of God strikingly similar, as we might expect it would be, to that originally denounced against him, which was now reserved for his son. In ether words, the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter in the person of his son, but it had a secondary fulfilment in its spirit on himself].
