As he left behind him thirty-eight children (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-21.htm">2 Chronicles 13:21</a>) at his decease, some three years later, he must have been of considerable age at his accession. This consideration rather favours the idea that Rehoboam was "<span class="accented">forty</span> and one years old when he began to reign" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">over Judah.</span>

The" three years" are not to be interpreted strictly. As he ascended the throne in the eighteenth and died in the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign, he cannot have completed three years. But it does not follow that "he cannot have reigned much more than two years" (Rawlinson, and similarly Keil). He may have reigned all but three] <span class="cmt_word">reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah</span> [in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> called <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, Heb. <span class="accented">Michajahu</span>. That the same person is meant is proved as well by the context as by <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, where the name is given as here. Keil (cf. Dict. Bib. 2:162) ascribes the discrepancy to an error of the copyist; but the names are so unlike in the original as to discountenance this assumption. I venture to suggest that <span class="accented">Michajahu</span> was the significant form - the word means "Who is like Jehovah?" - which the name Maachah, "oppression," borne by the Geshurite princess who married David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>) assumed when she joined the <span class="accented">Lord's peo</span>ple, and embraced, as no doubt she would <span class="accented">do</span>, the religion of Jehovah. Such a change would be quite in accordance with the genius and traditions of the Semitic races (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30</a>. <span class="accented">passim</span>; 32:28; 41:45; <a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, etc. Cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4, 6</a>), and there may well have been special reasons in this case, apart from the piety of David, why it should be made. For the name Maachah appears to have been taken Iron the town and district of that name near Geshur - a part of Syria was called <span class="accented">Syria Maachah</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-8</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14, 15</a> we read of a district of <span class="accented">Beth Maachah -</span> and it not improbably witnessed to unhappy memories. How natural it would be that David's bride should take a name of better omen and of a religious import, and how natural that the grand-daughter who bore her name should be called by that name in both its forms. Since writing the above, I find that a somewhat similar idea has occurred long since to others. Both Kimchi and Jarchi hold that she had two names. It is supposed by some that she assumed the name <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, as more dignified, on becoming queen. Wordsworth thinks that Michaiah was her real name, and that it was degraded into Maachah when she was deposed for idolatry. This latter view dovetails with the one suggested above. It  would be quite in accordance with Jewish usages and habits of thought that the name which had been changed into <span class="accented">Michaiah</span> when the grandmother became a proselyte, should be changed back into <span class="accented">Maachah</span> when this princess apostatized], <span class="cmt_word">the daughter</span> [rather, grand-daughter. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> includes all female descendants, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (see ver. 10) all anxestresses] <span class="cmt_word">of Abishalom.</span> We can hardly doubt that Absalom, the son of David, is meant here. We have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the express statement of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, "Rehoboam loved Maachah, the daughter of <span class="accented">Absalom</span>," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The fact that two of Rehoboam's other wives were of the family of David, which shows that it was part of his policy to marry the daughters of that house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The mother of Absalom was named Maachah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The name is so uncommon - in fact, it is <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;</span> - that another person can hardly be intended. Moreover the variation in spelling is extremely slight. It has been held, however, that a different person is designated by the name, principally because Absalom had but one daughter whose name was Tamar (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>), whereas Abijah's mother is said to have been the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>). But this difficulty admits of an easy solution. Tamar was doubtless married to Uriel, and Maachah was the fruit of this marriage. And with this explanation agrees the account of Josephus (Ant. 8:10,1).

But ver. 13 proves that he had sanctioned idolatry, and this was no doubt his principal sin, as the next words explain]: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord and his God, as the heart of David his father [the words used of Solomon. <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>].

The stability of the family of David on the throne for nearly 400 years, amid all the changes and chances of that period, and whilst in Israel there were "nine changes of dynasty within 250 years" is, as Rawlinson remarks, very "difficult to account for on mere grounds of human reason"]:

Every traveller will remember the <span class="accented">Mukama</span> which crown almost every hill. The religion of the Fellahin, though nominally Mohammedan, is really, like that of China, a worship of the dead. "In almost every village of the country a small building, surmounted by a whitewashed dome, is observable, being the sacred chapel of the place; it is variously called Kubbeh, "dome," Mazor, "shrine," or Mukam, "station," the latter being a Hebrew word, used in the Bible for the places of the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-2.htm">Deuteronomy 2:2</a>)...
