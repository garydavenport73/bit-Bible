There are three sorts of peace offerings - thank offerings (verses 12-15), votive offerings, and voluntary offerings (verses 16-18). Of these, the thank offerings were made in thankful memorial for past mercies; votive offerings were made in fulfillment of a vow previously taken, that such offering should be presented if a terrain condition were fulfilled. Voluntary offerings differ from votive offerings by not having been previously vowed, and from thank offerings by not having reference to any special mercy received. The thank offering must be eaten by the offerer and his friends, on the same day that it was offered; the votive and the voluntary offerings, which were inferior to the thank offering in sanctity, on the same day or the next. The reason why a longer time was not given probably was that the more the meal was delayed, the less would a religious character be attached to it. The necessity of a quick consumption also took away the temptation of acting grudgingly towards those with whom the feast might be shared, and it likewise precluded the danger of the flesh becoming corrupted. If any of the flesh remained till the third day, it was to be <span class="cmt_word">burnt with fire</span>; if eaten on that day, it should not be <span class="cmt_word">accepted or imputed unto him that offered</span>, that is, it should not be regarded as a sacrifice of sweet savour to God, but an abomination (literally, <span class="accented">a stench</span>), and whoever ate it should <span class="cmt_word">bear his iniquity</span>, that is, should be guilty of an offense, requiring, probably, a sin offering to atone for it. The bread gift accompanying the animal sacrifice was to consist of three kinds of unleavened cakes, and one cake of leavened bread, and <span class="cmt_word">one out of the whole oblation</span>, that is, one cake of each kind, was to be offered by heaving and then given to the officiating priest, the remaining cakes forming a part of the offerer's festive meal. If any one took part of a feast on a peace offering while in a state of Levitical uncleanness, he was to be <span class="cmt_word">cut off from his people</span>, that is, excommunicated, without permission to recover immediate communion by offering a sin offering. St. Paul joined in a votive offering (<a href="../../par/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>).

Probably it was silently abrogated; but the prohibition of blood was undoubtedly perpetual (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>), and it is based on a principle which does not apply to the fat (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).

The equal dignity of the peace offerings with the other offerings is vindicated by the command that the offerer <span class="cmt_word">shall bring it</span> with <span class="cmt_word">his own hands</span>, whereas it might have been regarded as merely the constituent part of a feast, and so sent by the hand of a servant. <span class="cmt_word">The breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">the right shoulder</span> were to be waved and heaved (for "heaved" does not merely mean" taken off," as some have said). The waving consisted of the priest placing his hands beneath those of the offerer who held the piece to be waved, and moving them slowly backwards and forwards before the Lord, to and from the altar; the heaving was performed by slowly lifting the pieces heaved upwards and downwards. The movements were made to show that the pieces, though not burnt on the altar, were yet in a special manner consecrated to God's service. <span class="accented">The right shoulder</span> was most probably the hind leg, perhaps the haunch. The Hebrew word is generally translated "leg" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-35.htm">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>). This part was the perquisite of the officiating priest; the waved breast was given to the priests' common stock. Afterwards an addition was made to the priests' portion (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>; see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>).
