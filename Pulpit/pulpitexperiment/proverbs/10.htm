A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <i>is</i> the heaviness of his mother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 22:16.</span> - Part III. FIRST GREAT COLLECTION (375) OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 12:28.</span> - First section. The sections are noted by their commencing usually with the words, "a wise son." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The proverbs of Solomon.</span> This is the title of the new part of the book; it is omitted in the Septuagint. There is some kind of loose connection in the grouping of these proverbs, but it is difficult to follow. "Ordo frustra quaeritur ubi nullus fuit observatus," says Mart. Geier. Wordsworth considers the present chapter to contain exemplifications of the principles and results of the two ways of life displayed in the preceding nine chapters. The antithetical character of the sentences is most marked and well sustained. As the book is specially designed for the edification of youth, it begins with an appropriate saying. <span class="cmt_word">A wise son maketh a glad father.</span> As wisdom comprises all moral excellence, and folly is vice and perversity, the opposite characters attributed to the son are obvious. The mother is introduced for the sake of parallelism; though some commentators suggest that as the father would be naturally elated by his son's virtues, which would conduce to honour and high estate, so the mother would be grieved at vices which her training had not subdued, and her indulgence had fostered. If this seems somewhat far-fetched, we may consider that the father in the maxim includes the mother, and the mother the father, the two being separated for the purpose of contrast (see on Proverbs 26:3). The word for heaviness occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a> and Proverbs 17:21. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Treasures of wickedness;</span> treasures acquired by wrong doing (<a href="../../par/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Profit nothing</span> "in the day of calamity" (Ecclus. 5:8; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>). The LXX. renders, "Treasures will not profit the wicked;" so Aquila. "For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>); not simply justice and moral goodness, but more especially liberality, benevolence. So in <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a> the Revised Version (in accordance with the best manuscripts) reads, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them," Christ proceeding to specify three outward acts as coming under this term, viz. almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. In some analogous passages the LXX. renders the word by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>; Tobit 12:9 (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delivereth from death,</span> shows that a man's heart is right towards God. and calls down special grace. Such a man lays up in store for himself a good foundation, that he may attain eternal life (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-19.htm">1 Timothy 6:19</a>; see on Proverbs 16:6). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a>). The soul is the life (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>). So the psalmist says (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>), "I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread." Christ speaks of the providence that watches over the lower creatures, and draws thence a lesson of trust in his care of man. concluding, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26, 33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he casteth away the substance of the wicked;</span> Septuagint, "He will overthrew the life of the wicked;" Vulgate, "He overturns the plots of sinners." The word rendered "substance" (<span class="accented">havvah</span>) is better understood as "desire." God frustrates the eager longing (for food or other good things) of the wicked; they are never satisfied, and get no real enjoyment out of what they crave (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">He becometh poor that dealeth <i>with</i> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That dealeth with a stack hand;</span> that is lazy and indolent (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10, 11</a>; see on Proverbs 19:15). The Septuagint, with a different pointing, reads, "Poverty humbleth a man." <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the diligent</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-24.htm">Proverbs 12:24</a>) <span class="cmt_word">maketh rich.</span> The words for "hand" are different in the two clauses as Wordsworth remarks. The first word is <span class="accented">caph</span>, the open, ineffective, hand or palm; the second term is <span class="accented">yad</span>, the hand tense and braced for vigorous work. The LXX. introduces a clause here which seems to interfere with the connection: <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "A well instructed son will be wise. and he will use a fool as his minister;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is aide to make even the foolish subserve his ends. The sentence is quoted by St. Augustine, 'De Civil Dei,' 16:2. The Vulgate inserts another paragraph, which is also found in some manuscripts of the Septuagint at <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12</a>: <span class="accented">Qui nititur</span> <span class="accented">mendaciis, hic pascit ventos</span>; <span class="accented">idem autem ipse sequitur aves volantes</span>, "He who relieth on lies feedeth on the winds, and pursueth flying birds." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">He that gathereth in summer <i>is</i> a wise son: <i>but</i> he that sleepeth in harvest <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that gathereth</span> the harvest into the barn at the right season. The idea of husbandry is continued from the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Son</span> is here equivalent to "man," the maxim being addressed to the young. <span class="cmt_word">That sleepeth;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that snoreth</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui stertit</span> (<a href="../../par/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A son that causeth shame.</span> The phrase is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-15.htm">Proverbs 29:15</a>. The Septuagint has, "The son of understanding is saved from the heat; but the sinful son is blasted by the wind in harvest." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-6.htm">Proverbs 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">Blessings <i>are</i> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</span> So Ver. 11. This is usually explained to mean either that the consciousness of his own iniquity silences the sinner when he would speak against the righteous, or his violence and injustice, returning on his own head, are like a bandage over his mouth (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), reducing him to shame and silence. Others, again, consider the signification to be - in default of the good, honest words which should proceed from a man's mouth, the sinner pours forth injustice and wickedness. But it is best (as in Ver. 14) to take "mouth" as the subject: "The mouth of the wicked concealeth violence," that he may wait for the opportunity of practising it. The contrast is between the manifest blessedness of the righteous and the secret sinister proceedings of the evil. The Vulgate and Septuagint give, "the blessing of the Lord." For "violence" the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "untimely grief;" the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chamas</span> bearing also the sense of "misery." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">The memory of the just <i>is</i> blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The memory.</span> The lasting, fragrant perfume of a holy life is contrasted with the noisomeness and quick decay of an evil name (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>). As a commentator asks, "Who ever thinks of calling a child Judas or Nero?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-8.htm">Proverbs 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will receive commandments.</span> The wise in heart is not proud or conceited: he accepts the Divine Law with all its directions (observe the plural "commandments"), and is not above learning from others; at the same time, he makes no display of his wisdom. <span class="cmt_word">The fool of lips</span> (ver. 10); one who is always exposing his folly. The literal antithesis is better shown by rendering "the solid in heart," and "the loose in lips." So Wordsworth. The Vulgate translates, "The fool is chastised by his lips;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the folly which he has uttered falls back upon him, and causes him to suffer punishment. The LXX. renders the last clause, "He who is given to prating (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>), walking tortuously, shall be tripped up." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that walketh uprightly</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>); Vulgate and Septuagint, "in simplicity," having nothing to conceal or to fear. So Christ enjoins his followers to be guileless as children, and harmless as doves (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-15.htm">Mark 10:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Surely</span>; equivalent to "securely;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, Aquila, having no fear of inopportune exposure, because he has no secret sin. <span class="cmt_word">He that perverteth his ways;</span> deals in crooked practices. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be known</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>). He shall be exposed and punished, and put to open shame. Having this apprehension always present, he cannot walk with confidence as the innocent does. Hence the antithesis in the text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that winketh with the</span> <span class="cmt_word">eye</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>). This is a sign of craft, malice, and complicity with other wicked comrades. Ecclus. 27:22, "He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil." <span class="cmt_word">Causeth sorrow</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>). He causes trouble and vexation by his cunning and secrecy. <span class="cmt_word">A prating fool</span> (as Ver. 8). The two clauses are intended to teach that the garrulous fool is even more certain to bring ruin on himself and others than the crafty plotter. The Septuagint and Syriac have changed the latter clause into a sentence supposed to be more forcibly antithetical, "He who reproveth with boldness maketh peace." But there are sentences not strictly antithetical in this chapter, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> vers. 18, 22 (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-10.htm">Proverbs 11:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">The mouth of a righteous <i>man is</i> a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A well of life</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>: 18:4). The good man utters words of wisdom, comfort, and edification. God himself is said to have "the well of life" (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>), and to be "the Fountain of living waters" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>): and the holy man, drawing from this supply, sheds life and health around. The second clause should be takes as in Ver. 6, <span class="cmt_word">but the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence,</span> the contrast being between the open usefulness of the good man's words and the harmful reticence of the malicious sinner. The Septuagint has, "A fountain of life is in the hand of the righteous; but destruction shall cover the mouth of the wicked." This is explained to mean that a good man's words and actions tend to spiritual health; a bad man's words bring down sorrow and punishment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hatred stirreth up strife</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Love covereth all sins</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>). The reference is primarily to the blood feud, the existence of which led to the establishment of the cities of refuge. Hatred keeps alive the old feeling of revenge, and seeks opportunities of satisfying it; but love puts aside, forgets and forgives all offences against itself. This sentiment comes very near the great Christian principle, "Love covereth a multitude of sins" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). The  Talmud pronounces, "To love a thing makes the eye blind, the ear deaf;" and the Arab says, "Love is the companion of blindness." Septuagint, "Love (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) covereth all those who love not strife."

A fool brings upon himself punishment by his insensate talk. Void of understanding; Hebrew, "wanting in heart;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui indiget corde.</span> The LXX. combines the two members into one proposition, "He who putteth forth wisdom with his lips is a rod to chastise the man without heart." In the Hebrew conception the "heart" is the seat, not only of the passions and affections, but also of the intellectual faculties.

He who cherishes hatred in the heart must be a liar and a hypocrite, speaking and acting in a way contrary to his real sentiments; if he divulges his slander, he is a stupid fool, injuring his neighbour, and procuring ill will for himself. The LXX. reads, "Just (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) lips conceal hatred;" but probably <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> is an error for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, though Ewald defends it, and would alter the Hebrew to suit it.

"Speak little," says Pinart ('Meditations,' ch. 6.), "because for one sin which we may commit by keeping silence where it would be well to speak, we commit a hundred by speaking upon all occasions" (see on Proverbs 17:27), Another rendering of the passage gives "By multitude of words sin does not vanish away;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you cannot mend a fault by much talking. But this weakens the contrast, and the Authorized Version is correct. <span class="cmt_word">Is wise.</span> St. James calls the reticent "a perfect man" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>). "This sentence of Scripture," says St. Augustine, in his 'Retractations,' "I greatly fear, because my numerous treatises, I know well, contain many things, if not false, at any rate idle and unnecessary."

Others translate, "die through one who wanteth understanding;" but if the Hebrew will bear this rendering, it is obvious that fools need no guide to their fall; their fate is a natural result. In this case the meaning must be that the foolish man involves others in destruction. But it is best to translate as the Authorized Version.

In acquiring and in using wealth thus blessed, the good man is contented and happy, while unsanctified fiches bring only trouble and vexation. But this seems rather feeble, and it is better to render, "And a man's own labor addeth nothing thereto." A man's own work must not be regarded as an equal cause of prosperity with the favour of God. This sentiment is in accordance with <a href="../../par/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1, 2</a>, "Except the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it so he giveth unto his beloved in sleep" - what others vainly labour for God giveth to the righteous without toil. The rendering of the clause, "Trouble is of no avail without it," is scarcely warranted by the wording of the text.

The wisdom intended is practical religion, the fear of God directing and showing itself in daily action.
