The terror which a king causes when his anger is rising is like the roar of a lion, which betokens danger. Septuagint, "The threat of a king differeth not from the wrath of a lion." Whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul; imperils his life, which he has no right wilfully to jeopard. Septuagint, "He who enrageth him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is an honour to a man to cease from strife;</span> or better, as Delitzsch and others, <span class="accented">to remain far from strife.</span> A prudent man will not only abstain from causing quarrel, but will hold himself aloof from all contention, and thus will have due care for his own honour and dignity. How different is this from the modern cede, which makes a man's honour consist in his readiness to avenge fancied injury at the risk of his own or his neighbour's life! Septuagint, "It is a glory to a man to hold himself aloof from revilings." <span class="cmt_word">Every fool will be meddling</span> (see on Proverbs 17:14; 18:1). Delitzsch, "Whoever is a fool showeth his teeth," finds pleasure in strife. Septuagint, "Every fool involves himself in such," as in ver. 1. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a></div><div class="verse">The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <i>therefore</i> shall he beg in harvest, and <i>have</i> nothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sluggard will not plough by reason of the cold;</span> <span class="accented">propter frigus</span>, Vulgate. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">choreph</span>) denotes the time of gathering - the autumn; so we would translate, "At the time of harvest the sluggard ploughs not" - just when the ground is most easily and profitably worked. "The weakness of the coulter and other parts of the plough requires that advantage be taken, in all but the most friable soils, of the softening of the surface by the winter or spring rains; so that the peasant, if industrious, has to plough in the winter, though sluggards still shrink from its cold, and have to beg in the harvest" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:491). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Mendicabit ergo aestate, et non dabitur illi.</span> But this does not accurately represent the meaning of the clause. If ever the prosperous are disposed to relieve the needy, it would be at the time when they have safely garnered their produce; an appeal to their charity at such a moment would not be made in vain. Rather the sentence signifies that the lazy man, having neglected to have his land ploughed at the proper time, "when he asks (for his fruits) at harvest time, there is nothing." He puts off tilling his fields day after day, or never looks to see if his labourers do their duty, and so his land is not cultivated, and he has no crop to reap when autumn comes. "By the street of By-and-by one arrives at the house of Never" (Spanish proverb). Taking a different interpretation of the word <span class="accented">choreph</span>, the LXX. renders, "Being reproached, the sluggard is not ashamed, no more than he who borrows corn in harvest."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness;</span> <span class="accented">chesed</span>, "kindness," "mercy," "liberality," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-22.htm">Proverbs 19:22</a>. So Ewald and others, Hitzig and Kamphausen translate, "Many a man one names his dear friend;" Delitzsch and Nowack prefer, "Most men meet a man who is gracious to them;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is common enough to meet a man who seems benevolent and well disposed. Vulgate, "Many men are called merciful;" Septuagint, "Man is a great thing, and a merciful man is a precious thing." The renderings of most modern commentators imply the statement that love and mercy are common enough, at least in outward expression. The Authorized Version pronounces that men are ready enough to parade and boast of their liberality, like the hypocrites who were said proverbially to sound a trumpet when they performed their almsdeeds (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>). Commenting on the Greek rendering of the clause given above, St. Chrysostom observes, "This is the true character of man to be merciful; yea, rather the character of God to show mercy... Those who answer not to this description, though they partake of mind, and are never so capable of knowledge, the Scripture refuses to acknowledge them as men, but calls them dogs, and horses, and serpents, and foxes, and wolves, and if there be any animals more contemptible" ('Hom. 4 in Phil.' and 'Hom. 13 in 1 Tim.,' Oxford transl.). The contrast between show, or promise, and performance is developed in the second clause. <span class="cmt_word">But a faithful man who can find?</span> The faithfulness intended is fidelity to promises, the practical execution of the vaunted benevolence; this is rare indeed, so that a psalmist could cry, "I said in my haste, All men are liars" (<a href="../../par/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>). Lesetre refers to Massillon's sermon, 'Sur la Gloire Humaine,' where we read (the preacher, of course, rests on the Latin Version), "Ces hommes vertueux dont le monde se fait tant d'honneur, n'ont au fond souvent pour eux que l'erreur publique. Amis fideles, je le veux; mais c'est le gout, la vanite ou Pin teret, qui les lie; et dans leur amis, ils n'amient qu' eux-memes En un mot, dit l'Ecriture, on les appelle misericordieux, ils ont toutes les vertus pour le public; mais n'etant pas fideles a Dieu, ils n'en ont pas une seule pour eux-memes." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a></div><div class="verse">The just <i>man</i> walketh in his integrity: his children <i>are</i> blessed after him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The just man walketh in his integrity.</span> It is better to connect the two clauses together, and not to take the first as a separate sentence, thus: "He who as a just man walketh in his integrity" - Blessed are his children after him (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-26.htm">Proverbs 14:26</a>). So the Septuagint and Vulgate. The man of pure life, who religiously performs his duty towards God and man, shall bring a blessing on his children who follow his good example, both during his life and after his death. The temporal promise is seen in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, etc. Some see here an instance of utilitarianism; but it cannot be supposed that the writer inculcates virtue for the sake of the worldly advantages connected with it; rather he speaks from experience, and from a faithful dependence on Providence, of the happy results of a holy life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-8.htm">Proverbs 20:8</a></div><div class="verse">A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - A royal and right noble maxim. <span class="cmt_word">A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</span> The king, sitting on the tribunal and executing his judiciary office, sees through all devices and pretences which cloak evil, and scatters them to the winds, as the chaff flies before the winnowing fan. Nothing unrighteous can abide in his presence (comp. ver. 26; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10</a>, etc.). See here an adumbration of the characteristic of the Messiah, the great King whose "eyes behold, whose eyelids try, the children of men" (<a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>): who is "of purer eyes than to behold evil" (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>); who "with righteousness shall judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall slay the wicked" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). Septuagint, "When the righteous king shall sit upon his throne, nothing that is evil shall offer itself before his eyes." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a></div><div class="verse">Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</span> The question implies the answer, "No one." This is expressed in <a href="../../par/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>, "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one." At the dedication of the temple, Solomon enunciates this fact of man's corruption, "There is no man that sinneth not" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-46.htm">1 Kings 8:46</a>). The prophet testifies, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is desperately sick: who can know it?" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). And St. John warns, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>). The heart is cleansed by self-examination and repentance; but it is so easy to deceive one's self in this matter, sins may lurk undetected, motives may be overlooked, so that no one can rightly be self-righteous, or conceited, or proud of his spiritual state. The "my sin" at the end of the clause is rather possible than actual sin; and the  expression means that no one can pride himself on being secure from yielding to temptation, however clean for a time his conscience may be. The verse, therefore, offers a stern corrective of two grievous spiritual errors - presumption and apathy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-10.htm">Proverbs 20:10</a></div><div class="verse">Divers weights, <i>and</i> divers measures, both of them <i>are</i> alike abomination to the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Divers weights,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">divers measures;</span> literally, <span class="accented">stone and stone, ephah and ephah.</span> The stones were used for weighing: dishonest traders kept them of different weights, and also measures of different capacities, substituting one for the other in order to defraud unwary customers. The Septuagint makes this plain by rendering, "A weight great and small, and measures double" (see on Proverbs 11:1 and Proverbs 16:11; and comp. ver. 23). The ephah was a dry measure, being one-tenth of the homer, and occupying the same position in solids as the bath did in liquids. It equalled about three pecks of our measure. <span class="cmt_word">Both of them are alike abomination to the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>, etc.); Septuagint, "Are impure before the Lord, even both of them, and he who doeth them." Pseudo-Bernard ('De Pass. Dom.,' 17.), applying the passage mystically, teaches that a man may be said to keep a double measure, who, being conscious of his own evil character, endeavours to appear righteous to others; who, as he puts it, "Suo judicio terrae proximus est, et aliis cupit elevatus videri." Others, connecting this verse in thought with the preceding, see in it a warning against judging a neighbour by a standard which we do not apply to ourselves. The Septuagint Version arranges the matter from ver. 10 onwards differently from the Hebrew, omitting vers. 14-19, and placing vers. 10-13 after ver. 22. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a></div><div class="verse">Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <i>be</i> pure, and whether <i>it be</i> right.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even a child is known</span> (<span class="accented">maketh himself known</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by his doings</span>. (For "even" (<span class="accented">gam</span>), see on Proverbs 17:26.) A child is open, simple, and straightforward in his actions; he has not the reserves and concealments which men practise, so you see by his conduct what his real character and disposition are. Ewald takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> in the sense of "play," "games;" but it seems never to have this meaning, and there is no need to change the usual signification. The habits of a life are learned in early age. The boy is father of the man. Delitzsch quotes the German proverbs, "What means to become a hook bends itself early," and "What means to become a thorn sharpens itself early;" and the Aramaean, "That which will become a gourd shows itself in the bud:" <span class="cmt_word">Whether his work be pure</span> ("clean," as ver. 9 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and whether it be right.</span> His conduct will show thus much, end will help one to prognosticate the future. Septuagint (according to the Vatican), "In his pursuits (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) a young man will be fettered in company with a holy man, and his way will be straight," which seems to mean that a good man will restrain the reckless doings of a giddy youth, and will lead him into better courses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12</a></div><div class="verse">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</span> This apothegm, which seems to be nothing but a trite truism, brings to notice many important consequences. First, there is the result noted in <a href="../../par/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>, "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?" Hence we learn the sleepless providence of God. So 'Pirke Aboth,' "Know that which is above thee, an eye that seeth all, an ear that heareth all." We learn also that all things are directed and overruled by God (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>). Then there is the thought that these powers of ours, being the gift of God, should be used piously and in God's service. "Mine ears hast thou opened...  Lo, I come...  I delight to do thy will, O my God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.). The eye should be blind, the ear deaf, to all that might defile or excite to evil (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). But it is the Lord alone that enables the spiritual organs to receive the wondrous things of God's Law; they must be educated by grace to enable them to perform their proper functions. "God hath given us eyes," says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 22 in 1 Corinthians'), "not that we may look wantonly, but that, admiring his handiwork, we may worship the Creator. And that this is the use of our eyes is evident from the things which are seen. For the lustre of the sun and of the sky we see from an immeasurable distances, but a woman's beauty one cannot discern so far off. Seest thou that for this end our eye was chiefly given? Again, he made the ear, that we should entertain not blasphemous words, but saving doctrines. Wherefore you see, when it receives anything dissonant, both our soul shudders and our very body also. And if we hear anything cruel or merciless, again our flesh creeps; but if anything decorous and kind, we even exult and rejoice." "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."

There is gold which is precious, and there is abundance of pearls which are still more valuable. But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel, and worth more than all. We had the expression, "lips of knowledge," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-7.htm">Proverbs 14:7</a>; it means lips that utter wisdom. <span class="accented">Keli</span>, often translated "jewel" in the Authorized Version, also boars the meaning of "vessel," "utensil."

(On the excellence and value of wisdom, see ch.

If a man is so weak and foolish as to become security for any one, and is unable to make good his engaged payment, let him lose his garment which the creditor would seize; his imprudence must bring its own punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</span> The Authorized Version probably adopts this rendering in conformity with <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a>, where it occurs in the text, as here in the margin (the Keri). But the Khetib has, "for strangers," which seems to be the original reading; and the first words ought to be translated, "hold him in pledge;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> seize his person for the sake of the strangers for whom he has stood security, so as not to suffer loss from them. The Law endeavoured to secure lending to needy brethren without interest (see <a href="../../par/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8, 13</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 22:12): but it allowed the creditor to secure himself by taking pledges of his debtor, while it regulated this system so as to obviate most of its severity and oppressiveness (see the restrictions in <a href="../../par/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6, 12</a>, etc.). "Where the debtor possessed nothing which he could pledge, he gave the personal security of a friend. This was a very formal proceeding. The surety gave his hand both to the debtor and to the creditor before an assembly legally convened, he deposited a pledge, and, in accordance with this twofold promise, was regarded by the creditor in just the same light as the debtor himself, and treated accordingly. If the debtor, or in his place the surety, was unable to pay the debt when it fell due, he was entirely at the mercy of the creditor. The authorities troubled themselves but little about these relations, and the law, so far as it is preserved to us, gave no directions in the matter. We see, however, from many allusions and narratives, what harsh forms these relations actually took, especially in later times, when the ancient national brotherly love which the Law presupposed was more and more dying out. The creditor could not only forcibly appropriate all the movable, but also the fixed property, including the hereditary estate (this at least till its redemption in the year of jubilee), nay, he could even (if he could find nothing else of value) carry off as a prisoner the body of his debtor, or of his wife and child, to employ them in his service, though this could only he done for a definite period" (Ewald, 'Antiquities,' p. 184, etc., transl.).

The legal penalty may be seen (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>); but this was probably seldom or never carried into execution (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-10.htm">Mark 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His lamp shall be put out in obscure</span> (<span class="accented">the blackest</span>) <span class="cmt_word">darkness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>).

"Lamp" is a metaphor applied to the bodily and the spiritual life, to happiness and prosperity, to a man's fame and reputation, to a man's posterity; and all these senses may be involved in the denunciation of the disobedient and stubborn child. He shall suffer in body and soul, in character, in fortune, in his children. His fate is the exact counterpart of the blessing promised in the Law. Septuagint, "The lamp of him that revileth father and mother shall be extinguished, and the pupils of his eyes shall behold darkness."

The maxim, taken in connection with the preceding verse, may apply to a bad son who thinks his parents live too long, and by violence robs them of their possessions; or to one who, like the prodigal in the parable, demands prematurely his portion of the paternal goods. But it may also be taken generally as denouncing the fate of those who make haste to be rich, being unscrupulous as to the means by which they gain wealth (see on Proverbs 23:11; 28:20, 22).

The <span class="accented">jus talonis</span> is the natural feeling of man, to do to others as they have done unto you, to requite evil with evil.

The Christian rule is expounded fully by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14, 17</a>, etc). It was not unknown to the Jews; for we read in Tobit 4:15, "Do that to no man which thou hatest;" and Hillel enjoins, "Do not thou that to thy neighbour which thou hatest when it is done to thee." Even the heathens had excogitated this great principle. There is a saying of Aristotle, preserved by Diogenes Laertius, "Act towards your friends as you would wish them to act towards you." The Chinese have a proverb, "Water does not remain on the mountain, or vengeance in a great mind." <span class="cmt_word">Wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee.</span> The pious writer urges the injured person to commit his cause to the Lord, not in the hope of seeing vengeance taken on his enemy, but in the certainty that God will help him to bear the wrong and deliver him in his own good time and way. The Christian takes St. Peter's view, "Who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-13.htm">1 Peter 3:13</a>), knowing that "all things work together for good to them that love God" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; comp. Ecclus. 2:2, 6). Septuagint, "Say not, I will avenge myself on my enemy, but wait on the Lord, that (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) he may help thee." The last clause may be grammatically rendered thus, but it is more in accordance with the spirit st' the proverb, as Delitzsch observes, to regard it as a promise.

The proverb says that the steps of a great and powerful man depend, as their final cause, upon the Lord; he conditions and controls results. Man has free will, and is responsible for his actions, but God foreknows them, and holds the thread that connects them together; he gives preventing grace; he gives efficient grace: and man blindly works out the designs of Omnipotence according as he obeys or resists. A similar maxim is found in <a href="../../par/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>, "A man's goings are established of the Lord," but the meaning there is that it is God's aid which enables a man to do certain actions. Here we have very much the same intimation that is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> and Proverbs 19:21; and see note on Proverbs 16:9. Hence arises the old prayer used formerly at prime, and inserted now (with some omissions) at the end of the Anglican Communion Service: "O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, our thoughts, words, and actions, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection we may be preserved both here and forever." If man cannot see all sides, as God does, cannot comprehend the beginning, middle, and end in one view, how then can a man (a weak mortal) understand his own ways. How can he find out of himself whither he should go, or what will be the issue of his doings (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>)? St. Gregory, "It is well said by Solomon [<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>], 'There are righteous and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God; and yet no man knoweth whether he is deserving of love or of hatred; but all things are kept uncertain for the time to come.' Hence it is said again by the same Solomon, 'What man will be able to understand his own way?' And any one doing good or evil is doubtless known by the testimony of his own conscience. But it is said that their own way is not known to men, for this reason, because, even if a man understands that he is acting rightly, yet he knows not, under the strict inquiry, whither he is going" ('Moral.,' 29:34).

Septuagint, "It is a snare to a man hastily to consecrate something of his own" (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2, 4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And after vows to make inquiry;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after he has made his vow, to begin to consider whether he can fulfil it or not. This is a snare to a man, strangles his conscience, and leads him into the grievous sins of perjury and sacrilege. Septuagint, "For after vowing ensueth repentance." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a></div><div class="verse">A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wise king scattereth the wicked</span> (ver. 8). The verb is <span class="accented">zarah</span>, which means "to winnow, or sift." The king separates the wicked and the good, as the winnowing fan or shovel divides the chaff from the wheat. The same metaphor is used of Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>), "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>). Septuagint, "A winnower (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) of the ungodly is a wise king." <span class="cmt_word">And bringeth the wheel over them.</span> The threshing wheel is meant (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). This was a wooden frame with three or four rollers under it armed with iron teeth. It was drawn by two oxen, and, aided by the weight of the driver, who had his seat upon it, it crushed out the grain, and cut up the straw into fodder. Another machine much used in Palestine was made of two thick planks fastened together side by side, and having sharp stones fixed in rows on the lower surface. It is not implied that the king employed the corn drag as an instrument of punishment, which was sometimes so used in war, as possibly may be inferred from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>; and <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. The idea of threshing is carried on, and the notion is rather of separation than of punishment, though the latter is not wholly excluded. The wise ruler will not only distinguish between the godless and the good, but will show his discrimination by visiting the evil with condign puuishment. Septuagint, "He will bring the wheel upon them;" the Vulgate has curiously, <span class="accented">Incurvat super eos fornicem</span>, "He bends an arch over them," which Latin commentators explain as a triumphal arch, meaning that the king conquers and subdues the wicked, and celebrates his victory over them. A patent anachronism which needs no comment!

We may consider it as equivalent to what we Christians call conscience, with its twofold character of receiving light and illumination from God, and sitting as judge and arbiter of actions. It is named "the Lord's lamp," because this moral sense is a direct gift of God, and enables a man to see his real condition. Our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-23.htm">Matthew 6:23</a>) speaks of the light that is in man, and gives a solemn warning against the danger of letting it be darkened by neglect and sin; and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>) argues, "Who among men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man, which is in him?" As Elihu says (<a href="../../par/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>), "There is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding." And Aristotle speaks of practical wisdom (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) combined with virtue as "the eye of the soul (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Searching all the inward parts of the belly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the very depths of the soul, probing thoughts, desires, affections, will, and approving or reproving, according as they are in conformity with or opposition to God's Law. We must remember that Eastern houses, before the introduction of glass, had very scanty openings to admit light, and lamps were necessary if for any purpose the interior had to be thoroughly illuminated. Hence the metaphor used above would strike an Oriental more forcibly than it strikes us. Septuagint, "The breath (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span>, as <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>) of man is a light of the Lord, who searches the chambers of the belly." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 12:64), "We ought to bear in mind that in holy Writ by the title of the 'belly,' or the 'womb,' the mind is used to be understood. For the light of grace, which comes from above, affords a 'breathway' to man unto life, which same light is said to 'search all the inward parts of the belly,' in that it penetrates all the secrets of the heart, that the things which were hidden in the soul touching itself it may bring back before the eyes thereof" (Oxford transl.).

The love and faithfulness which the king displays in dealing with his subjects elicits the like virtues in them, and these are the safeguard of his throne. <span class="cmt_word">His throne is upholden by mercy;</span> or, <span class="accented">love.</span> So the king is well called the father of his people, and in modern times the epithet "gracious" is applied to the sovereign as being the fountain of mercy and condescension. Sallust, 'Jugurtha,' 10, "Non exercitus neque thesauri praesidia regni sunt, verum amici, quos neque armis cogere neque auro parare queas; officio et fide pariuntur." Septuagint,  "Mercy (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) and truth are a guard to a king, and will surround his throne with righteousness." "The subject's love," says our English maxim, "is the king's lifeguard."

The moralist (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>) bids the young man rejoice in his youth, and let his heart cheer him in those happy days, but at the same time remember that he is responsible for the use which he makes of his powers and faculties, for for all these things God will bring him to judgment. The Greek gives a needful warning - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"In youth remember thou wilt soon be old."</span> Septuagint, "Wisdom is an ornament to young men."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-30.htm">Proverbs 20:30</a></div><div class="verse">The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so <i>do</i> stripes the inward parts of the belly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Livor vulneris absterget mala. Chaburoth</span> means "stripes," and the proverb says that deep-cutting stripes are the only effectual cure of evil; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> severe punishment is the best healing process in cases of moral delinquency (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>). Painful remedies, incisions, cauteries, amputations, are often necessary in the successful treatment of bodily ailments; spiritual sickness needs sterner, more piercing, remedies. <span class="cmt_word">So do stripes the inward parts of the belly;</span> or better, <span class="accented">and strokes that reach</span>, etc. The stings of conscience, warnings and reproofs which penetrate to the inmost recesses of the heart, chastisement which affects the whole spiritual being. - these are needful to the correction and purification of inveterate evil. Aben Ezra connects this verse with the preceding thus: as strength gives a glory to young men, and hoar hairs adorn an old man, so wounds and bruises, so to speak, ornament the sinner, mark him out, and at the same time heal and amend him. It may also be connected with ver. 27. If a man will not use the lamp which God has given him for illumination and correction, he must expect severe chastisement and sternest discipline. Septuagint, "Bruises (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) and contusions befall bad men, and plagues that reach to the chambers of the belly." St. Gregory, 'Moral.,' 23:40, "By the blueness of a wound he implies the discipline of blows on the body. But blows in the secret parts of the belly are the wounds of the mind within, which are inflicted by compunction. For as the belly is distended when filled with food, so is the mind puffed up when swollen with wicked thoughts. The blueness, then, of a wound, and blows in the secret parts of the belly, cleanse away evil, because both outward discipline does away with faults, and compunction pierces the distended mind with the punishment of penance. But they differ from each other in this respect, that the wounds of blows give us pain, the sorrows of compunction have good savour. The one afflict and torture, the others restore when they afflict us. Through the one there is sorrow in affliction, through the other there is joy in grief" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 19"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 21"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
