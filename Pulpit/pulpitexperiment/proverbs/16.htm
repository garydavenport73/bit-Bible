It is better translated, <span class="accented">The plans of the heart are man's</span>: <span class="accented">but the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah.</span> Men make plans, arrange speeches, muster arguments, in the mind; but to put these into proper, persuasive words is a gift of God. "Our sufficiency is of God" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>). In the case of Balaam, God overruled the wishes and intentions of the prophet, and constrained him to give utterance to something very different from his original mental conceptions. But the present sentence attributes the outward expression of what the mind has conceived in every case unto the help of God (comp. vers. 9, 33; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>). Christ enjoined his disciples to trust to momentary inspiration in their apologies or defences before unbelievers (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>). This verse is omitted in the Septuagint.

He too knows our secret faults, unsuspected by others, and perhaps by ourselves (<a href="../../par/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>). The Septuagint has here, "All the works of the humble are manifest before God, but the impious shall perish in an evil day." The next verse is omitted in the Greek; and the other clauses up to ver. 8 are dislocated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Commit thy works unto the Lord.</span> "Commit" (<span class="accented">gol</span>) is literally "roll" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Theodotion), as in <a href="../../par/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a> and Psalm 37:5; and the injunction means, "Transfer thy burden to the Lord, cast upon him all that thou hast to do; do all as in his sight, and as an act of duty to him." Thus Tobit says to his son, "Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper" (Tobit 4:19). The Vulgate, using a different punctuation (<span class="accented">gal</span>), renders, "Reveal to the Lord thy works?' As a child opens its heart to a tender parent, so do thou show to God thy desires and intentions, trusting to his care and providence. <span class="cmt_word">And thy thoughts shall be established.</span> The plans and deliberations out of which the "works" sprang shall meet with a happy fulfilment, because they are undertaken according to the will of God, and directed to the end by his guidance (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>). This verse is not in the Septuagint. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath made all <i>things</i> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath made all things for himself</span>. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">propter semetipsum</span>; and Origen ('Praef. in Job'), <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. That is, God hath made everything for his own purpose, to answer the design which he hath intended from all eternity (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>). But this translation is not in accordance with the present reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which means rather "for its own end," for its own proper use. Everything in God's design has its own end and object and reason for being where it is and such as it is; everything exhibits his goodness and wisdom, and tends to his glory. Septuagint,  "All the works of the Lord are with righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span> This clause has been perverted to support the terrible doctrine of reprobation - that God, whose will must be always efficacious, has willed the damnation of some; whereas we are taught that God's will is that "all men should be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth," and that "God sent his Son not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). Man, having freewill, can reject this gracious purpose of God, and render the means of salvation nugatory; but this does not make God the cause of man's destruction, but man himself. In saying that God "made the wicked," the writer does not mean that God made him as such, but made him as he made all other things, giving him powers and capacities which he might have used to good, but which, as a fact, he uses to evil. It will be useful here to quote the wise words of St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 6:33), "The Just and Merciful One, as he disposes the deeds of mortals, vouchsafes some things in mercy, and permits other things in anger; and the things which he permits he so bears with that he turns them to the account of his purpose. And hence it is brought to pass in a marvellous way that even that which is done without t,e will of God is not contrary to the will of God. For while evil deeds are converted to a good use, the very things that oppose his design render service to his design." <span class="accented">The day of evil</span> is the hour of punishment (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>), which by a moral law will inevitably fall upon the sinner. God makes man's wickedness subserve his purposes and manifest his glory, as we see in the case of Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>), and the crucifixion of our blessed Lord (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>). It is a phase of God's moral government that an evil day should be appointed for transgressors, and it is from foreknowledge of their deserts that their punishment is prepared. The perplexing question, why God allows men to come into the world whom he knows will meet with perdition, is not handled here. Septuagint, "But the impious is kept for an evil day." Cato, 'Dist.,' 2:8 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nolo putes pravos homines peccata lucrari:<br />Temporibus peccata latent, sed tempore patent."</span>

A mediaeval jingle runs - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Hoc retine verbum, frangit Deus omne superbum."</span> Septuagint, "Impure in the sight of God is every high-hearted man (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." The second member is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>, and must be taken as a form of adjuration. Septuagint, "Putting hands on hand unjustly, he shall not be innocent;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who acts violently and unjustly shall be held guilty - which seems a trite truism. Many commentators interpret the clause as if it meant that the cooperation and combination of sinners in evil practices will not save them from retribution. But hand clasping hand in token of completing a bargain or alliance is scarcely an early Oriental custom. There is an analogous saying in Greek which implies mutual assistance - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Hand washes hand, and finger finger."</span> The LXX. has here two distiches, the first of which occurs in the Vulgate, but the second is not found there. Neither appears in our present Hebrew text. "The beginning of the good way is to do what is just; this is more acceptable to God than to sacrifice sacrifices. He who seeketh the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness; and they who seek him rightly alkali find peace." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By mercy and truth iniquity is purged;</span> <span class="accented">atoned for.</span> The combination "mercy and truth" occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a> (where see note), and intimates love to God and man, and faithfulness in keeping promises and truth and justice in all dealings. It is by the exercise of those graces, not by mere external rites, that God is propitiated (see on Proverbs 10:2). A kind of expiatory value is assigned to these virtues, which, indeed, must not be pressed too closely, but should be examined by the light of such passages in the New Testament as <a href="../../par/luke/11-41.htm">Luke 11:41</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>. Of course, such graces show themselves only in one who is really devout and God fearing; they are the fruits of a heart at peace with God and man, and react on the character and conduct. The LXX., which places this distich after ver. 27 of ch. 15, translates, "By alms and faithfulness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) sins are cleansed," confining the term "mercy" to one special form, as in one reading of <a href="../../par/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6</a>. l, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness [<span class="accented">al.</span> alms] before men." <span class="cmt_word">By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</span> The practice of true religion, of course, involves abstinence from sin; and this seems so unnecessary a truth to be formally stated  that some take the "evil" named to be physical, not moral evil; calamity, not transgression. But the two clauses are coordinate, and present two aspects of the same truth. The first intimates how sin is to be expiated, the second how it is to be avoided. The morally good man meets with pardon and acceptance, and he who fears God is delivered from evil. So we pray, in the Lord's Prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses, and deliver us from evil." Septuagint, "By the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When a man's ways please the Lord,</span> which they can do only when they are religious, just, and charitable. <span class="cmt_word">He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;</span> to submit themselves. Experience proves that nothing succeeds like success. Where a man is prosperous and things go well with him, even ill-wishers are content to east away or to dissemble their dislike, and to live at peace with him. Thus Abimelech King of Gerar fawned upon Isaac because he saw that the Lord was with him (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-27.htm">Genesis 26:27</a>, etc.). This is the worldly side of the maxim. It has a higher aspect, and intimates the far reaching influence of goodness - how it disarms opposition, arouses reverence and love, gives no occasion for disputes, and spreads around an atmosphere of peace. To the Jews the maxim was taught by external circumstances. While they were doing the will of the Lord, their land was to be preserved from hostile attack (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>). And Christians learn that it is only when they obey and fear God that they can overcome the assaults of the enemies of their soul - the devil, the world, and the flesh Talmud, "He who is agreeable to God is equally agreeable to men."

"Man proposes, God disposes" or, as the Germans say, "Der Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24</a>). The word rendered "deviseth" implies, by its spectra, intensity of thought and care. Man meditates and prepares his plans with the utmost solicitude, but it rests with God whether he shall carry them to completion or not, and whether, if they are to be accomplished, it be done with ease or with painful labour (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12</a>, etc.).

The king's words have, in people's minds, the certainty and importance of a Divine oracle, putting an end to all controversy or division of opinion. It seems to be a general maxim, not especially referring to Solomon or the theocratic kingdom, but rather indicating the traditional view of the absolute monarchy. The custom of deifying kings and invoking them as gods was usual in Egypt and Eastern countries, and made its way to the West. "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man," cried the people, when Herod addressed them in the amphitheatre at Caesarea (<a href="../../par/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>).

We may refer to Solomon's famous verdict concerning the two mothers (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>, etc.), and such sentences as <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>, "By me (wisdom) kings reign, and princes decree justice" (see below on ver. 12; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>); and David's words (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>), "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God" (Wisd. 9:4, 10, 12). Delitzsch regards the second hemistich as giving a warning (consequent on the former clause), and not stating a fact, "In the judgment his mouth should not err." The present chapter contains many admonitions to kings which a wise father like Solomon may have uttered and recorded for the benefit of his son. If this is the case, it is as strange as it is true that Rehoboam made little use of the counsels, and that Solomon's latter days gave the lie to many of them.

(For the law that regulates such matters, see <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a>, etc.) That cheating in this respect was not uncommon we learn from the complaints of the prophets, as <a href="../../par/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>. The religious character of the standard weights and measures is shown by the term "shekel of the sanctuary" (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, and elsewhere continually).

Certainly neither Solomon nor many of his successors exhibited this high character. The Septuagint, followed by some modern commentators, translates, "He who doeth wickedness is an abomination to kings;" but as the "righteousness" in the second clause (<span class="cmt_word">the throne is established by righteousness</span>) undoubtedly refers to the king, so it is more natural to take the "wickedness" in the first member as being his own, not his subjects'. When a ruler acts justly and wisely, punishes the unruly, rewards the virtuous, acts as God's vicegerent, and himself sets the example of the character which becomes so high a position, he wins the affection of his people, they willingly obey him. and are ready to die for him and his family (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>).

The LXX. translates, "The king's wrath is a messenger of death," taking the plural as put by enallage for the singular; but possibly the plural may intimate the many agents who are prepared to perform the ruler's behests, and the various means which he possesses for punishing offenders. This first clause implies, without expressly saying, that, such being the case, none but a fool will excite the monarch's resentment (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a>); then the second clause comes in naturally. <span class="cmt_word">But a wise man will pacify it.</span> He will take care not to provoke that anger which gluts its resentment so quickly and so fatally (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>).

And seest thou how he hurls his bolts always against the mightiest buildings and the loftiest trees? For God is wont to cut short whatever is too highly exalted" (comp.

The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint, "The man prudent in affairs is a finder of good things;" he attends to his business, and thinks out the best mode of accomplishing his plans, and therefore succeeds in a worldly sense (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he;</span> or, <span class="accented">hail to him</span>, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>. To heed the Word and to trust in the Lord are correlative things; handling a matter wisely can hardly belong to the same category. The Septuagint contrasts the worldly success of one who manages business wisely and discreetly with the blessedness of him who, when he has done all, commits his cause to God and trusts wholly to him: "He who hath trusted in the Lord is blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>)."

Knowledge ought not to be buried in one's own mind, but produced on fit occasions and in suitable words for the edification of others. Ecclus. 20:30, "Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>).

Wise men are called bad and worthless by the vulgar herd, either because they do not impart all they know, or because they are envied fear their learning; but those who are eloquent and gracious in speech shall receive much instruction from what they bear, every one being ready to converse with them anal impart any knowledge which they possess.

The character intended is the perverse man, who distorts the truth, gives a wrong impression, attributes evil motives; such a one occasions quarrels and heartburnings. <span class="cmt_word">And a whisperer separateth chief friends</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>). <span class="accented">Nirgan</span> is either "a chatterer," or "a whisperer," "calumniator." In <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-8.htm">Proverbs 18:8</a> and Proverbs 26:20, 22 it is translated "tale bearer." "Be not called a whisperer (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," says the Son of Sirach (Ecclus. 5:14), speaking of secret slander. "Slanderers," says an old apothegm, "are Satan's bellows to blow up contension." Septuagint, "A perverse man sendeth abroad evils, and kindleth a torch of deceit for the wicked, and separateth friends." The alternative rendering of the second clause, "estrangeth a leader," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> alienates one leader from another, or from his army, is not confirmed by the authority of the versions or the best commentators. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-29.htm">Proverbs 16:29</a></div><div class="verse">A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <i>that is</i> not good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A violent man enticeth his neighbour.</span> The man of violence (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-31.htm">Proverbs 3:31</a>) is one who wrongs others by injurious conduct, by fraud or oppression. How such a one "enticeth," talks a man over, we see in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>, etc. Septuagint, "The lawless man tempts (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) friends." <span class="cmt_word">And leadeth him into the way that is not good</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>); a position where he will suffer some calamity, or be induced to commit some wickedness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a></div><div class="verse">He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - This verse is better taken as one sentence (so the Septuagint), and translated, as Nowack, "He that shutteth his eyes in order to contrive froward things, he that compresseth his lips, hath already brought evil to pass;" he has virtually effected it. From such a crafty, malignant man you need not expect any more open tokens of his intentions. <span class="cmt_word">He shutteth his eyes</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>); either that he may better think out his evil plans, or else he cannot look his neighbour in the face while he is plotting against him. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">attonitis oculis</span>; Septuagint, "fixing (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) his eyes." <span class="cmt_word">Moving his lips;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he who compresseth his lips</span>, to hide the malignant smile with which he might greet his neighbour's calamity (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>, etc.; Proverbs 10:10), or that neither by word nor expression he may betray his thoughts. Others take the two outward expressions mentioned as signals to confederates; but this is not so suitable, as they are the man's own feelings and sentiments that are meant. One who gives these tokens <span class="cmt_word">bringeth evil to pass;</span> he has perfected his designs, and deems them as good as accomplished, and you will do well to note what his bearing signifies. Some take the meaning to be, brings punishment on himself; but the warning is not given for the sinner's sake. Septuagint, "He defines (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) all evils with his lips; he is a furnace of evil." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a></div><div class="verse">The hoary head <i>is</i> a crown of glory, <i>if</i> it be found in the way of righteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hoary head is a crown of glory</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/20-29.htm">Proverbs 20:29</a>). (For "crown," see on Proverbs 17:6.) Old age is the reward of a good life, and therefore is an honour to a man (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-11.htm">Proverbs 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If it be found</span> - rather, <span class="accented">it shall be found</span> - <span class="cmt_word">in the way of righteousness;</span> the guerdon of obedience and holiness; whereas "bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days" (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). It is well said in the Book of Wisdom (4, 5, etc.), "Honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a></div><div class="verse"><i>He that is</i> slow to anger <i>is</i> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is</span> <span class="cmt_word">slow to anger</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>) <span class="cmt_word">is better than the mighty.</span> The long suffering, non-irascible man is more of a hero than the valiant commander of a  great army.

'Pirke Aboth,' 4:1, "Who is the hero? The man that restrains his thoughts." Maxims about self-mastery are common enough. Says an unknown poet, "Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit Moenia, nec virtus altius ire potest." So Publ. Syr., 'Sent.,' 795, "Fortior est qui cupiditates suas, quam qui hostes subjicit." And the mediaeval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Linguam fraenare<br />Plus est quam castra domare."</span> At the end of this verse the Alexandrian Manuscript of the Septuagint, followed by later hands in some other uncials, adds, "and a man having prudence [is better] than a great farm." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a></div><div class="verse">The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <i>is</i> of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lot is cast into the lap.</span> The bosom or fold of the garment (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>). It is not quite clear what articles the Jews used in their divinations by lot. Probably they employed stones, differing in shape or colour, or having some distinguishing mark. These were placed in a vessel or in the fold of a garment, and drawn or shaken thence. Such a practice has been common in all ages and countries; and though only cursorily mentioned in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>), it was used by the Jews from the time of Joshua, and in the earliest days of the Christian Church (see <a href="../../par/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:28, etc.). As by this means man's agency was minimized, and all partiality and chicanery were excluded, the decision was regarded as directed by Providence. There is one case only of ordeal in the Law, and that under suspicion of adultery (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12</a>, etc.). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, in place of the lot we read (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>), "An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife." <span class="cmt_word">The whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</span> In these cases the Jew learned to see, in what we call chance, the overruling of Divine power. But this was not blind superstition. He did not feel justified in resorting to this practice on every trivial occasion, as persons used the <span class="accented">Sortes Virgilianae</span> or even the verses of the Bible for the same purpose. The lot was employed religiously in cases where other means of decision were not suitable or available; it was not to supersede common prudence or careful investigation; but, for example, in trials where the evidence was conflicting and the judges could not determine the case, the merits were ascer-rained by lot (comp. ch. 18:18). After the effusion of the Holy Spirit, the apostles never resorted to divination, and the Christian Church has wisely repudiated the practice of all such modes of discovering the Divine will. Septuagint, "For the unrighteous all things fall into their bosom, but from the Lord are all just things," which may mean either that, though the wicked seem to prosper, God still works out his righteous ends; or the evil suffer retribution, and thus God's justice is displayed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
