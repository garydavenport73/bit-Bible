So St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>) calls his converts "a crown of glorying." The allusion is to the crown worn by the bridegroom at his marriage, or to the garlands worn at feasts (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/3-11.htm">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; Wisd. 2:8). The Son of Sirach has much praise for the virtuous woman: "Blessed is the man that hath a good (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) wife, for the number of his days shall be double. A virtuous (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace" (Ecclus. 26:1, 2). <span class="cmt_word">She that maketh ashamed;</span> "that doeth shamefully" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>); one who is a terrible contrast to the woman of  strong character - weak, indolent, immodest, wasteful. <span class="cmt_word">Is as rottenness in his bones</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>). Such a wife poisons her husband's life, deprives him of strength and vigour; though she is made "bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>), far from being a helpmate for him, she saps his very existence. Septuagint, "As a worm in a tree, so an evil woman destroyeth a man." Here again Siracides has much to say, "A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees" (Ecclus. 25:23). Thus runs a Spanish maxim (Kelly, 'Proverbs of All Nations') - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Him that has a good wife no evil in life<br />that may not be borne can befall;<br />Him that has a bad wife no good thing in life<br />that chance to, that good you may call."</span>

St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job,' lib. 25) takes another view, seeing in "judgments" the stings of conscience, and a rehearsal of the day of account. "The righteous," he says, "approach the secret chambers of the Judge in the recesses of their own hearts; they consider how smartly he smites at last, who long patiently bears with them. They are afraid for the sins which they remember they have committed; and they punish by their tears the faults which they know they have perpetrated. They dread the searching judgments of God, even in those sins which perchance they cannot discover in themselves. And in this secret chamber of inward judgment, constrained by the sentence of their own conduct, they chasten with penitence that which they have committed through pride" (Oxford transl.). But <span class="cmt_word">the counsels of the wicked</span> - which they offer to others - <span class="cmt_word">are</span> <span class="cmt_word">deceit.</span> The mere "thoughts" are contrasted with the mature, expressed "counsels" Septuagint, "The wicked steer (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) deceits."

Some commentators see in the phrase the idea of suddenness, "While they turn themselves round, they are no more" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a>; <a href="../../par/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>).

Thus we read of David, that he behaved himself wisely, "and he was acceptable in the sight of all the people" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>). The Septuagint, taking <span class="accented">lephi</span> differently, renders, "The mouth of the prudent is commended by men." <span class="cmt_word">He that is of a perverse heart;</span> Vulgate, "a vain and senseless man;" Septuagint, "one slow of heart (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/12-9.htm">Proverbs 12:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>He that is</i> despised, and hath a servant, <i>is</i> better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse may be translated, <span class="accented">Better is a man who is lightly esteemed and hath a slave, than he that boasts himself and lacketh bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man who is thought little of by his fellows, and is lowly in his own eyes, if he have a slave to minister to his wants (which all Orientals of even moderate wealth possess), is better off than one who boasts of his rank and family, and is all the while on the verge of starvation. "Respectful mediocrity is better than boastful poverty." Ecclus. 10:27, "Better is he that laboreth and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread." But the words rendered, <span class="cmt_word">hath a slave,</span> are literally, <span class="accented">a servant to himself.</span> So the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">sufficiens sibi</span>, "sufficing himself," and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "serving himself." And the expression implies attending to his own concerns, supplying his own wants. Hence the gnome means, "It is wiser to look after one's own business and provide for one's own necessities,  even if thereby he meets with contempt and detraction, than to be in real want, and all the time assuming the airs of a rich and prosperous man." This latter explanation seems most suitable, as it is not at all clear that, at the time the book was written, the Israelites of moderate fortune kept slaves, and the proverb would lose its force if they did not do so. Says a mediaeval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nobilitas morum plus ornat quam genitorum."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">A righteous <i>man</i> regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked <i>are</i> cruel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.</span> For "regardeth," the Hebrew word is literally "knoweth" (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a>); he knows what animals want, what they can bear, and treats them accordingly (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>). The LXX. translates "pitieth." The care for the lower animals, and their kind treatment, are not the produce of modern sentiment and civilization. Mosaic legislation and various expressions in Scripture recognize the duty. God's mercies are over all his works; he saves both man and beast; he hateth nothing that he hath made (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; Wisd. 11:24). So he enacted that the rest of the sabbath should extend to the domestic animals (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>); that a man should help the over-burdened beast, even of his enemy (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4, 5</a>); that the unequal strength of the ox and the ass should not be yoked together in the plough (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>); that the ox should not be muzzled when he was treading out the corn (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>): that the sitting bird should not be taken from her little brood (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>), nor a kid seethed in its mother's milk (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). Such humane injunctions were perhaps specially needed at a time when man's life was little regarded, and animal sacrifices had a tendency to make men cruel and unfeeling, when their symbolical meaning was obscured by long familiarity. These enactments regarding animals, and the mysterious significance affixed to the blood (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), afforded speaking lessons of tenderness and consideration for the inferior creatures, and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> taught regard for the happiness and comfort of fellow men. Our blessed Lord has spoken of God's ears of flowers and the lower creatures of his hand. <span class="cmt_word">But the tender mercies;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the bowels</span>, regarded as the seat of feeling. The wicked cannot be supposed to have "tender mercies;" hence it is best to take the word in the sense of "feelings," "affections." What should be mercy and love are in an evil man only hard-heartedness and cruelty.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/12-12.htm">Proverbs 12:12</a></div><div class="verse">The wicked desireth the net of evil <i>men</i>: but the root of the righteous yieldeth <i>fruit</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Modern commentators have endeavoured to amend the text of this verse by various methods, which may be seen in Nowack's note on the passage; but the existing reading gives an appropriate sense, and alteration is not absolutely needed, though it is plain that the LXX had before them something different from the Masoretic text. <span class="cmt_word">The wicked desireth the net of evil men</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>), that he may use the means which they take to enrich themselves; or <span class="accented">matsod</span> may mean, not the instrument, but the prey - "such booty as evil men capture;" or yet again, the word may mean "fortress," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wicked seeks the protection of evil men. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Desiderium impii munimentum est pessimorum</span>, "What the wicked desire is the support of evil men," or, it may be, "the defense of evil men," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that these may be secured from suppression and interruption. Another interpretation, which, however, seems somewhat forced, is that "the net" is a metaphor for the judgment of God, which overtakes sinners, and into which they run with such blind infatuation that they seem to "desire" it, The safest explanation is the second one given above, which signifies that the wicked man seeks by every means to obtain the prey which he sees sinners obtain, and, as is implied, gets small return for his labour, does not advance his interests. <span class="cmt_word">But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.</span> The root supplies the sap and vigour needed for healthy produce. Without any evil devices or plotting, the righteous gain all that they want as the natural result of their high principles. Another hindering is, "He (the Lord) will give a root of the righteous," will enable them to stand firm in time of trial. Septuagint, "The desires  of the impious are evil; but the roots of the pious are in strongholds," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are secure.

A man by speaking unadvisedly or intemperately brings trouble upon himself, involves himself in difficulties which he did not foresee.

The just; the man who does not offend with his lips, avoids these snares. The Septuagint here introduces a couplet not found in the Hebrew: "He who looketh gently (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) shall obtain mercy; but he who frequents the gates [or, 'contends in the gates,' <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>] will harass souls." This seems to mean the man who is calm and considerate for others will himself be treated with pity and consideration (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>); but he who is a gossip, or a busybody, or litigious, will be always vexing his neighbours.

Septuagint, "The ways of the revengeful (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) are unto (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) death." St. Chrysostom refers ('Hom. 16 in Ephesians') to this rendering: "He here speaks of vindictiveness; for on the spur of the moment he allows the sufferer to act in order to cheek the aggressor; but further to bear a grudge he permits not; because the act then is no longer one of passion, nor of boiling rage, but of malice premeditated. Now, God forgives those who may be carried away, perhaps upon a sense of outrage, and rush out to resent it. Hence he says, 'eye for eye;' and yet again 'The ways of the revengeful lead to death." Vulgate, "A devious path leads to death" - a path, that is, which turns aside from the right direction, a life and conversation which are alien from justice and piety. But both the Septuagint and the Vulgate have missed the right meaning of the words in question; <span class="accented">derek nethibah</span>, "pathway." Many see in this verse a plain evidence that the writer believed in the immortality of the soul. We have reason to suppose that such was his faith, but it cannot be proved from this passage, though we may consider that he was guided to speak in terms to which later knowledge would affix a deeper interpretation (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>, and note there). It is Jesus Christ "who hath brought life and immortality (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) to light through the gospel" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>). Writers in Solomon's time could speak only darkly about this sublime and comforting hope, though later, as in the Book of Wisdom and throughout most of the Apocryphal books, it formed a common topic, and was used as a reason for patience and resignation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
