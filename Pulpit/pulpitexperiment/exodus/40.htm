All was now ready. Bezaleel and Aholiab had completed their task. The work for the tabernacle had been given in, and had been approved Moses did not however at once set it up. He waited for a command from God. After a short interval, the command came. He was ordered to select the first day of the ensuing year - the first day of the first year of freedom - for the operation. Directions were given him, which fixed the order in which the various parts were to be set up, and assigned to the various articles of furniture their proper places (vers. 1-8). When he had arranged the whole as directed, he was to anoint the various parts (vers. 9-11). He was then to wash and dress Aaron, and his sons; to invest them with their robes of office (vers. 12-14), and to anoint them to be priests (ver. 15). The orders given were executed, except (as it would seem) those concerning the investiture of the priests and the anointing, which were deferred. (See <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6-30</a>.)

Probably, there would not have been time to go through all the ceremonies enjoined (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-34</a>) on the same day with the erection of the sanctuary. They were consequently deferred, either till the next day, or possibly to a later date. (See <a href="../../par/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>.) The anointing of the tabernacle is recorded in ver. 10; of the vessels in ver. 11; of the altar and laver in the same. The washing of Aaron and his sons in ver. 6; their investiture in vers. 7-9; the anointing of Aaron in ver. 12; and a further anointing of Aaron together with his sons in ver. 30.

The oil was first poured upon Aaron's head (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), and afterwards sprinkled upon him (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>). It was, apparently, only sprinkled upon the priests (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). This was a lower form of anointing; and hence the high priest was sometimes called "<span class="accented">the</span> anointed priest" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-32.htm">Leviticus 16:32</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood.</span> The Rabbinical commentators maintain that these words apply to the ordinary priests only, and on the strength of them establish a difference between the ordinary priests and the high priests. The latter were in every ease to be anointed to their office. A single anointing sainted for the former. It is scarcely necessary to say that there is no Scriptural ground for this distinction. The natural sense of the words is, rather, that as long as the anointing continued, the priesthood should continue.

Those who had watched the proceedings, and those who had been engaged in them, were probably about to retire to rest. Even Moses had withdrawn, and left the tabernacle to itself - when suddenly, there was a manifestation of Divine Power. The cloud, which had gone before the Israelites from Succoth onward (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20-22</a>), and which had recently settled upon the extemporised "Tent of Meeting" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>), left its place, and "covered" the newly-erected structure externally (ver. 34), while an intensely brilliant light - here called "the glory of God" - filled the whole interior of the tabernacle (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). Moses, it appears, would fain have re-entered the tabernacle - to see the great sight" (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3</a>); but he could not - the "glory" was too dazzling (ver. 35). Thus a distinct approval was given to all that had been done. God accepted his house, and entered it. The people saw that he had foregone his wrath, and would be content henceforth to dwell among them and journey with them. Henceforth, throughout the wanderings, the cloud and tabernacle were inseparable. If the cloud was lifted a little off it and moved in front, the tabernacle had to follow (ver. 36) - if it settled down on the roof, the people stopped and remained until it moved again (ver. 37). The appearance was as of a cloud by day, and as of fire by night, so that all could always see where the tabernacle was, and whether it was stationary or in motion (ver. 38). After the first descent, it would seem that "the glory" withdrew into the Holy of Holies, so that both Moses and the priests could enter the holy place, and minister there (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-13.htm">Leviticus 10:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then a cloud</span>. In the original "the cloud," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cloud so often spoken of (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19, 20, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15-18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Covered the tent</span>. Descended on the outer covering and rested there. <span class="cmt_word">Filled the tabernacle</span>. Entered inside, and filled both holy place and Holy of Holies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses was not able to enter</span>. It is implied that he wished - nay, tried - to enter  - but the "glory" prevented him. (Compare <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-14.htm">2 Chronicles 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-2.htm">2 Chronicles 7:2</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Because the cloud abode thereon</span>. It was not the external "cloud" which prevented Moses from entering, but the internal "glory." But the two are regarded as inseparable.

The last three verses describe the manner in which the cloud henceforth served  the Israelites as guide - not only directing their course, but determining when they were to move, and how long they were to rest at each encampment.

The cloud had two aspects  - one obscure, the other radiant. It was a dark column by day - a pillar of fire by night.
